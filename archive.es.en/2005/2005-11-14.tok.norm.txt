since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .
she added there is a clear distinction drawn between physical or medical neglect and an absolute lack of mental stimulation , which can in turn have physical consequences .
in extreme cases , it can lead to a child 's growth becoming stunted with no physiological explanation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy families are no foregone conclusion in modern germany in 2004 alone , more than 17,000 boys and girls were taken away from their families by social services , because they were considered to be at risk . " what goes on behind closed doors is often very dramatic , " siggelkow said .
the berlin vicar added that the impoverished often try and save money by not providing for their children rather than sacrificing themselves . authorities caught betwee n two stools although the violation of parental care is a punishable offence , child welfare authorities often struggle to meet their protective function .
basic constitutional law in germany secures parents the right to bring up their own children , but that said , the state has a constitutional responsibility to monitor education and care . hamburg 's greens and social democrats say that in the case of serious doubt , a child 's welfare should come before parental rights .
both parties are calling for the nine regular medical checks currently offered to children between birth and the age of five , to be made mandatory .
as it stands , many parents do n't take their children to the last three examinations , which politicians say could help to curb any increase in neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany offers parents a series of thorough check-ups for their kids hermann-josef kahl of germany 's professional association of pediatricians said he believes the way forward could be gentle sanctions for those parents who do n't take their children to their medical check-ups . " it would be possible to link the payment of family allowance or the distribution of kindergarten or university places to the number of check-ups attended , " he said .
in order to underscore the importance of the health checks , the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- is organizing an awareness campaign . help before pu n ishme n t but abelmann-vollmer said she is not convinced that making medical check-ups for children obligatory is such a good idea . " the parents of neglected children are already up against it and bogging them down in yet more duties , does n't have a good effect on the children , " she said . instead , she suggested a diversity of low-threshold options , such as mother and child cafes and toddlers ' groups , which offer help at an early stage before a situation has the chance to escalate . what is clear is that germany has to take some action .
siggelkow said he has long been expecting a case of starvation in berlin , and would not be remotely surprised to see severely neglected children dumped outside the " arche " one day in the future . johanna tüntsch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .

since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .
she added there is a clear distinction drawn between physical or medical neglect and an absolute lack of mental stimulation , which can in turn have physical consequences .

the berlin vicar added that the impoverished often try and save money by not providing for their children rather than sacrificing themselves . authorities caught betwee n two stools although the violation of parental care is a punishable offence , child welfare authorities often struggle to meet their protective function .
basic constitutional law in germany secures parents the right to bring up their own children , but that said , the state has a constitutional responsibility to monitor education and care . hamburg 's greens and social democrats say that in the case of serious doubt , a child 's welfare should come before parental rights .
both parties are calling for the nine regular medical checks currently offered to children between birth and the age of five , to be made mandatory .

" it would be possible to link the payment of family allowance or the distribution of kindergarten or university places to the number of check-ups attended , " he said .
in order to underscore the importance of the health checks , the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- is organizing an awareness campaign . help before pu n ishme n t but abelmann-vollmer said she is not convinced that making medical check-ups for children obligatory is such a good idea .

siggelkow said he has long been expecting a case of starvation in berlin , and would not be remotely surprised to see severely neglected children dumped outside the " arche " one day in the future . johanna tüntsch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .

the regime blocked an internet site nominated for deutsche welle 's weblog awards . the 12-member jury of deutsche welle 's 2005 weblog awards -lrb- bobs -rrb- on monday condemned the blocking of " wang yi 's microphone " and called on the chinese authorities to stop censoring weblogs and the internet .
the bobs jury members ' protest comes just days before the world summit on the information society begins on nov .
16 in tunis .
failure to declare their protest in light of the summit would be tantamount to tolerating censorship , they said .
a chinese delegation is expected to take part in the event .
" bloggers like wang yi , who are courageous enough to publicly protest against government bans , deserve the support of the international community , " said guido baumhauer , editor-in-chief of dw-world.de , deutsche welle 's online presence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wang yi wang yi 's weblog was among the final three candidates for the special award from the paris-based human rights organization reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- .

" this action really shows that the chinese government has no respect for freedom of expression , " said julien pain , a member of the bobs jury and head of the reports without borders internet freedom desk .
" the chinese government started censoring the internet a long time ago , it is not the first time that a blog has been shut down , but it shows again that each time a new form of circulating information is created , the chinese authorities manage to control it and shut it down - and that 's scary . "
chinese jury member zhao jing , better known as michael anti , said he the chinese authorities ' decision was a grave mistake .
" blogs play an important role in freedom of speech , and the fact that the chinese government is censoring them proves how far china is from accepting free speech , " he said .

it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .

during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .

the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

but merkel must still be voted into the position by the bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , on nov .
22 , before she can get to work . approval of the coalition deal will not , of course , be the last of the hard negotiations between the cdu / csu and the spd .
the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

only spain can feel confident of progressing while the other games remain on a knife edge . spain could be excused for heading for the travel agent on monday morning to book their tickets to germany in june after thrashing slovakia 5-1 in their world cup qualification play-off first leg tie in madrid on saturday . luis aragones and his team fly out to bratislava on wednesday for the return game safe in the knowledge that , barring a phenomenal collapse , spain will be at their eighth consecutive world cup next summer . garcia hat-trick si n ks slovakia a luis garcia hat-trick , a penalty from fernando torres and a late fifth from fernando morientes sunk the woeful slovaks who were reduced to ten men after defender marian had was sent off after 64 minutes for protesting the penalty award . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey were muscled-out of the game against switzerland in berne .

it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.11.2005 all-round approval for new coalition pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's almost there the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor-designate angela merkel overwhelmingly approved a new coalition deal monday as did the social democrats and christian social union . the approval of the deal by the conservatives , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , at separate congresses on monday laid the basis for merkel to be installed at the head of a potentially fragile and unwieldy bipartisan government . the endorsements for germany 's political marriage of convenience will likely lead to merkel being sworn in as the country 's first woman chancellor and the first chancellor from the former communist east .
but merkel must still be voted into the position by the bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , on nov .
22 , before she can get to work . approval of the coalition deal will not , of course , be the last of the hard negotiations between the cdu / csu and the spd .
the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 14.11.2005 german industry not amused by coalition deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grand coalition 's dance has so far failed to impress business as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery . the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , jürgen thumann , is not going quite as far as some of his colleagues , who have heaped criticism on the policy roadmap thrashed out by the conservatives and social democrats last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's major parties finalized a coalition deal last week all things considered , thumann says , the power-sharing pact is a continuation of the reform course set under gerhard schröder 's government . it still wo n't stir the economy back to life , nor will it see the immediate creation of new jobs .
but the deal does contain a hint of promise that things will gradually get better in germany within the next four-year term of the new government , he said . criticism , but for differe n t reaso n s but , that 's where the good news ends .
many industry leaders are skeptically eyeing the coalition deal , while others complain that it 's simply headed in the wrong direction . the trade unions , in particular , are angry .
the planned hike in value added tax -lrb- vat , or sales tax -rrb- is one target of their ire , the other includes measures to loosen germany 's strict laws protecting employees from dismissal . though nothing fundamental will change about existing job protection legislation , companies will in future be able to keep newcomers on a trial period for longer - for two years instead of the current six months . hans eberhard schleyer , head of the association of german trade , said the planned reforms do n't go far enough . " increasing trial periods to two years may be a step in the right direction , but one has to wait and see , " he said .
" essentially , much more has to happen in terms of labor market reform than is laid down in the coalition deal . " raisi n g retireme n t age co n troversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the retirement age in germany is a touchy issue another point of the coalition deal , an increase in the retirement age to 67 from the current 65 , has also proved controversial . walter hirrlinger , head of the social association vdk , said he was against freezing pension hikes for pensioners and raising the working age of employees .
hirrlinger warned the government that it would face a wave of strikes and protests . " when you consider that raising pensions is put off indefinitely and that pensioners can increasingly spend less each year at a time when the inflation rate is over 2 percent , then you ca n't say that it 's really very fair for them -lrb- pensioners -rrb- , " he said . however , raising the retirement age has been strongly welcomed by business leaders . half-hearted measures ? at the same time , some like dieter hundt , head of the employers ' association , pointed out that most of the measures are half-hearted and stop short of a " real bold stroke . " " with tax and social contributions hikes , we 're not going to contribute towards stimulating economic growth , holding on to jobs and creating new ones in germany , " hundt said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just looking ?
germans are n't willing to loosen their purse strings the bleak sentiment was echoed in germany 's struggling retail sector , which has for years been suffering from germans ' tendency to save for a rainy day rather than splurge . hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the retail association said that floundering consumer confidence in germany would be further dampened if the vat hike came into effect , pointing out that it would cost the economy some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28.2 billion -rrb- . " we 're happy that the vat hike will only come into force starting january , 2007 , " pellengahr said .
" that gives us enough time to correspondingly adapt prices .
it 's better to increase vat in one go , rather than spread this 3-percent hike over a longer time frame . " eco n omists slam purpose of vat hike indeed , much of the criticism about the future government 's policy blueprint is centered on the vat hike . but , a look at germany 's neighbors shows that the country 's current rate of 19 percent vat is modest in comparison .
in sweden and denmark , sales tax touches 25 percent . the biggest complaint from economists is that the additional revenues generated by the vat hike are to be used to plug gaping holes in public finances and bring down germany 's ballooning budget deficit rather than to lower non-wage labor costs . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the crunch issues almost two months after an inconclusive election , germany 's major parties have forged a coalition deal for a four-year term under incoming chancellor angela merkel .

since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .
she added there is a clear distinction drawn between physical or medical neglect and an absolute lack of mental stimulation , which can in turn have physical consequences .

the berlin vicar added that the impoverished often try and save money by not providing for their children rather than sacrificing themselves . authorities caught betwee n two stools although the violation of parental care is a punishable offence , child welfare authorities often struggle to meet their protective function .
basic constitutional law in germany secures parents the right to bring up their own children , but that said , the state has a constitutional responsibility to monitor education and care . hamburg 's greens and social democrats say that in the case of serious doubt , a child 's welfare should come before parental rights .
both parties are calling for the nine regular medical checks currently offered to children between birth and the age of five , to be made mandatory .

" it would be possible to link the payment of family allowance or the distribution of kindergarten or university places to the number of check-ups attended , " he said .
in order to underscore the importance of the health checks , the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- is organizing an awareness campaign . help before pu n ishme n t but abelmann-vollmer said she is not convinced that making medical check-ups for children obligatory is such a good idea . " the parents of neglected children are already up against it and bogging them down in yet more duties , does n't have a good effect on the children , " she said . instead , she suggested a diversity of low-threshold options , such as mother and child cafes and toddlers ' groups , which offer help at an early stage before a situation has the chance to escalate . what is clear is that germany has to take some action .
siggelkow said he has long been expecting a case of starvation in berlin , and would not be remotely surprised to see severely neglected children dumped outside the " arche " one day in the future . johanna tüntsch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .

" the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 14.11.2005 german industry not amused by coalition deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grand coalition 's dance has so far failed to impress business as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery . the head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , jürgen thumann , is not going quite as far as some of his colleagues , who have heaped criticism on the policy roadmap thrashed out by the conservatives and social democrats last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's major parties finalized a coalition deal last week all things considered , thumann says , the power-sharing pact is a continuation of the reform course set under gerhard schröder 's government . it still wo n't stir the economy back to life , nor will it see the immediate creation of new jobs .
but the deal does contain a hint of promise that things will gradually get better in germany within the next four-year term of the new government , he said . criticism , but for differe n t reaso n s but , that 's where the good news ends .
many industry leaders are skeptically eyeing the coalition deal , while others complain that it 's simply headed in the wrong direction . the trade unions , in particular , are angry .
the planned hike in value added tax -lrb- vat , or sales tax -rrb- is one target of their ire , the other includes measures to loosen germany 's strict laws protecting employees from dismissal . though nothing fundamental will change about existing job protection legislation , companies will in future be able to keep newcomers on a trial period for longer - for two years instead of the current six months . hans eberhard schleyer , head of the association of german trade , said the planned reforms do n't go far enough . " increasing trial periods to two years may be a step in the right direction , but one has to wait and see , " he said .
" essentially , much more has to happen in terms of labor market reform than is laid down in the coalition deal . " raisi n g retireme n t age co n troversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the retirement age in germany is a touchy issue another point of the coalition deal , an increase in the retirement age to 67 from the current 65 , has also proved controversial . walter hirrlinger , head of the social association vdk , said he was against freezing pension hikes for pensioners and raising the working age of employees .
hirrlinger warned the government that it would face a wave of strikes and protests . " when you consider that raising pensions is put off indefinitely and that pensioners can increasingly spend less each year at a time when the inflation rate is over 2 percent , then you ca n't say that it 's really very fair for them -lrb- pensioners -rrb- , " he said . however , raising the retirement age has been strongly welcomed by business leaders . half-hearted measures ? at the same time , some like dieter hundt , head of the employers ' association , pointed out that most of the measures are half-hearted and stop short of a " real bold stroke . " " with tax and social contributions hikes , we 're not going to contribute towards stimulating economic growth , holding on to jobs and creating new ones in germany , " hundt said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just looking ?
germans are n't willing to loosen their purse strings the bleak sentiment was echoed in germany 's struggling retail sector , which has for years been suffering from germans ' tendency to save for a rainy day rather than splurge . hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the retail association said that floundering consumer confidence in germany would be further dampened if the vat hike came into effect , pointing out that it would cost the economy some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28.2 billion -rrb- . " we 're happy that the vat hike will only come into force starting january , 2007 , " pellengahr said .
" that gives us enough time to correspondingly adapt prices .
it 's better to increase vat in one go , rather than spread this 3-percent hike over a longer time frame . " eco n omists slam purpose of vat hike indeed , much of the criticism about the future government 's policy blueprint is centered on the vat hike . but , a look at germany 's neighbors shows that the country 's current rate of 19 percent vat is modest in comparison .
in sweden and denmark , sales tax touches 25 percent . the biggest complaint from economists is that the additional revenues generated by the vat hike are to be used to plug gaping holes in public finances and bring down germany 's ballooning budget deficit rather than to lower non-wage labor costs . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the crunch issues almost two months after an inconclusive election , germany 's major parties have forged a coalition deal for a four-year term under incoming chancellor angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.11.2005 all-round approval for new coalition pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's almost there the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor-designate angela merkel overwhelmingly approved a new coalition deal monday as did the social democrats and christian social union . the approval of the deal by the conservatives , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , at separate congresses on monday laid the basis for merkel to be installed at the head of a potentially fragile and unwieldy bipartisan government . the endorsements for germany 's political marriage of convenience will likely lead to merkel being sworn in as the country 's first woman chancellor and the first chancellor from the former communist east .
but merkel must still be voted into the position by the bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , on nov .
22 , before she can get to work . approval of the coalition deal will not , of course , be the last of the hard negotiations between the cdu / csu and the spd .
the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

but the deal does contain a hint of promise that things will gradually get better in germany within the next four-year term of the new government , he said . criticism , but for differe n t reaso n s but , that 's where the good news ends .
many industry leaders are skeptically eyeing the coalition deal , while others complain that it 's simply headed in the wrong direction . the trade unions , in particular , are angry .
the planned hike in value added tax -lrb- vat , or sales tax -rrb- is one target of their ire , the other includes measures to loosen germany 's strict laws protecting employees from dismissal . though nothing fundamental will change about existing job protection legislation , companies will in future be able to keep newcomers on a trial period for longer - for two years instead of the current six months . hans eberhard schleyer , head of the association of german trade , said the planned reforms do n't go far enough . " increasing trial periods to two years may be a step in the right direction , but one has to wait and see , " he said .
" essentially , much more has to happen in terms of labor market reform than is laid down in the coalition deal . " raisi n g retireme n t age co n troversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the retirement age in germany is a touchy issue another point of the coalition deal , an increase in the retirement age to 67 from the current 65 , has also proved controversial . walter hirrlinger , head of the social association vdk , said he was against freezing pension hikes for pensioners and raising the working age of employees .
hirrlinger warned the government that it would face a wave of strikes and protests . " when you consider that raising pensions is put off indefinitely and that pensioners can increasingly spend less each year at a time when the inflation rate is over 2 percent , then you ca n't say that it 's really very fair for them -lrb- pensioners -rrb- , " he said . however , raising the retirement age has been strongly welcomed by business leaders . half-hearted measures ? at the same time , some like dieter hundt , head of the employers ' association , pointed out that most of the measures are half-hearted and stop short of a " real bold stroke . " " with tax and social contributions hikes , we 're not going to contribute towards stimulating economic growth , holding on to jobs and creating new ones in germany , " hundt said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just looking ?
germans are n't willing to loosen their purse strings the bleak sentiment was echoed in germany 's struggling retail sector , which has for years been suffering from germans ' tendency to save for a rainy day rather than splurge . hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the retail association said that floundering consumer confidence in germany would be further dampened if the vat hike came into effect , pointing out that it would cost the economy some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28.2 billion -rrb- . " we 're happy that the vat hike will only come into force starting january , 2007 , " pellengahr said .
" that gives us enough time to correspondingly adapt prices .
it 's better to increase vat in one go , rather than spread this 3-percent hike over a longer time frame . " eco n omists slam purpose of vat hike indeed , much of the criticism about the future government 's policy blueprint is centered on the vat hike . but , a look at germany 's neighbors shows that the country 's current rate of 19 percent vat is modest in comparison .
in sweden and denmark , sales tax touches 25 percent . the biggest complaint from economists is that the additional revenues generated by the vat hike are to be used to plug gaping holes in public finances and bring down germany 's ballooning budget deficit rather than to lower non-wage labor costs . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the crunch issues almost two months after an inconclusive election , germany 's major parties have forged a coalition deal for a four-year term under incoming chancellor angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.11.2005 all-round approval for new coalition pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's almost there the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor-designate angela merkel overwhelmingly approved a new coalition deal monday as did the social democrats and christian social union . the approval of the deal by the conservatives , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , at separate congresses on monday laid the basis for merkel to be installed at the head of a potentially fragile and unwieldy bipartisan government . the endorsements for germany 's political marriage of convenience will likely lead to merkel being sworn in as the country 's first woman chancellor and the first chancellor from the former communist east .
but merkel must still be voted into the position by the bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , on nov .
22 , before she can get to work . approval of the coalition deal will not , of course , be the last of the hard negotiations between the cdu / csu and the spd .
the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .
she added there is a clear distinction drawn between physical or medical neglect and an absolute lack of mental stimulation , which can in turn have physical consequences .

the berlin vicar added that the impoverished often try and save money by not providing for their children rather than sacrificing themselves . authorities caught betwee n two stools although the violation of parental care is a punishable offence , child welfare authorities often struggle to meet their protective function .
basic constitutional law in germany secures parents the right to bring up their own children , but that said , the state has a constitutional responsibility to monitor education and care . hamburg 's greens and social democrats say that in the case of serious doubt , a child 's welfare should come before parental rights .

" it would be possible to link the payment of family allowance or the distribution of kindergarten or university places to the number of check-ups attended , " he said .
in order to underscore the importance of the health checks , the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- is organizing an awareness campaign . help before pu n ishme n t but abelmann-vollmer said she is not convinced that making medical check-ups for children obligatory is such a good idea . " the parents of neglected children are already up against it and bogging them down in yet more duties , does n't have a good effect on the children , " she said . instead , she suggested a diversity of low-threshold options , such as mother and child cafes and toddlers ' groups , which offer help at an early stage before a situation has the chance to escalate . what is clear is that germany has to take some action .

since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .
she added there is a clear distinction drawn between physical or medical neglect and an absolute lack of mental stimulation , which can in turn have physical consequences .

but merkel must still be voted into the position by the bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , on nov .
22 , before she can get to work . approval of the coalition deal will not , of course , be the last of the hard negotiations between the cdu / csu and the spd .
the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

but the deal does contain a hint of promise that things will gradually get better in germany within the next four-year term of the new government , he said . criticism , but for differe n t reaso n s but , that 's where the good news ends .
many industry leaders are skeptically eyeing the coalition deal , while others complain that it 's simply headed in the wrong direction . the trade unions , in particular , are angry .
the planned hike in value added tax -lrb- vat , or sales tax -rrb- is one target of their ire , the other includes measures to loosen germany 's strict laws protecting employees from dismissal . though nothing fundamental will change about existing job protection legislation , companies will in future be able to keep newcomers on a trial period for longer - for two years instead of the current six months . hans eberhard schleyer , head of the association of german trade , said the planned reforms do n't go far enough . " increasing trial periods to two years may be a step in the right direction , but one has to wait and see , " he said .
" essentially , much more has to happen in terms of labor market reform than is laid down in the coalition deal . " raisi n g retireme n t age co n troversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the retirement age in germany is a touchy issue another point of the coalition deal , an increase in the retirement age to 67 from the current 65 , has also proved controversial . walter hirrlinger , head of the social association vdk , said he was against freezing pension hikes for pensioners and raising the working age of employees .
hirrlinger warned the government that it would face a wave of strikes and protests .

and the bad ?
most of it is on a fast-track out of the country . considering the sorry state of the economy , the country 's contemporary art boom is one ray of light on an otherwise bleak horizon . " germany is currently the second largest contemporary art market after the us , " said michael neff , director of art frankfurt .

" the main aspect of buying art is not so much financial investment as pleasure , " he explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean arp 's " femme " went under the hammer in 2003 " art is not a standard consumer good , " he said .
" it 's like books .
if the economy is depressed you drive your car a few years longer , but you do n't stop reading books .
it 's the same with art .
and in the face of constant bad news , valuing art highly is perhaps more important than ever . " " art has a lot to do with prestige , " art market expert wolfgang wilke told the daily faz .
" despite the stock market crash of 2000 , the art market has remained astonishingly stable .
there seems to be a new factor , which is that people are interested in buying art for reasons which are not purely economic .

" pushing german art werner tammen from the association of berlin galleries agrees that art is an increasingly coveted commodity primarily because of its cultural cachet . " 95 percent of art is bought because people see it as a personal enrichment , " he observed .

" it 's now paying off , and this art is very sought after at international art fairs , which has positive economic repercussions for germany .
international collectors are eager visitors here , because there 's so much art being produced . " a lost opportunity " but in other respects , the situation is appalling , " he went on .
" public acquisition budgets in the capital have been cut back to virtually nothing . " the consequences are potentially disastrous . " german art is being bought by international museums rather than german ones , " said tammen .

" museums tend to step in and buy only after prices have already skyrocketed , " pointed out tammen .
" given that budgets are n't likely to increase in the foreseeable future , there 's a serious possibility that forty years from now , museums collections will give the impression there was no art being made at the moment , when in fact the current art scene could n't be more vibrant . " " we have to watch out we do n't lose our cultural heritage because it 's being snapped up by international buyers , " he added .
" there is n't a single museum in berlin right now that 's in a position to acquire recent art , because there are simply no funds available . " refocusing urban policy " politicians completely underestimate the importance of art as an economic factor , " pointed out alexander sandmeier .
" it 's a question of changing perceptions . " this could involve adopting what prospect magazine has dubbed the " cool city strategy . "
according to the arts community , promoting culture rather than commerce is an efficient way of turning an economy round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visiting moma in 2004 exhibition boosted tourist numbers " basically , arts and culture is the capital 's trump card , " insisted tammen .
" when berlin makes an international splash , it does so with its arts and culture .
so it should be better promoted .
it 's what attracts investors to the city , who in turn pay taxes here .

since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .
she added there is a clear distinction drawn between physical or medical neglect and an absolute lack of mental stimulation , which can in turn have physical consequences .
in extreme cases , it can lead to a child 's growth becoming stunted with no physiological explanation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy families are no foregone conclusion in modern germany in 2004 alone , more than 17,000 boys and girls were taken away from their families by social services , because they were considered to be at risk . " what goes on behind closed doors is often very dramatic , " siggelkow said .
the berlin vicar added that the impoverished often try and save money by not providing for their children rather than sacrificing themselves . authorities caught betwee n two stools although the violation of parental care is a punishable offence , child welfare authorities often struggle to meet their protective function .
basic constitutional law in germany secures parents the right to bring up their own children , but that said , the state has a constitutional responsibility to monitor education and care . hamburg 's greens and social democrats say that in the case of serious doubt , a child 's welfare should come before parental rights .
both parties are calling for the nine regular medical checks currently offered to children between birth and the age of five , to be made mandatory .
as it stands , many parents do n't take their children to the last three examinations , which politicians say could help to curb any increase in neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany offers parents a series of thorough check-ups for their kids hermann-josef kahl of germany 's professional association of pediatricians said he believes the way forward could be gentle sanctions for those parents who do n't take their children to their medical check-ups . " it would be possible to link the payment of family allowance or the distribution of kindergarten or university places to the number of check-ups attended , " he said .
in order to underscore the importance of the health checks , the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- is organizing an awareness campaign . help before pu n ishme n t but abelmann-vollmer said she is not convinced that making medical check-ups for children obligatory is such a good idea . " the parents of neglected children are already up against it and bogging them down in yet more duties , does n't have a good effect on the children , " she said . instead , she suggested a diversity of low-threshold options , such as mother and child cafes and toddlers ' groups , which offer help at an early stage before a situation has the chance to escalate . what is clear is that germany has to take some action .
siggelkow said he has long been expecting a case of starvation in berlin , and would not be remotely surprised to see severely neglected children dumped outside the " arche " one day in the future . johanna tüntsch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .

but the deal does contain a hint of promise that things will gradually get better in germany within the next four-year term of the new government , he said . criticism , but for differe n t reaso n s but , that 's where the good news ends .
many industry leaders are skeptically eyeing the coalition deal , while others complain that it 's simply headed in the wrong direction . the trade unions , in particular , are angry .
the planned hike in value added tax -lrb- vat , or sales tax -rrb- is one target of their ire , the other includes measures to loosen germany 's strict laws protecting employees from dismissal . though nothing fundamental will change about existing job protection legislation , companies will in future be able to keep newcomers on a trial period for longer - for two years instead of the current six months . hans eberhard schleyer , head of the association of german trade , said the planned reforms do n't go far enough . " increasing trial periods to two years may be a step in the right direction , but one has to wait and see , " he said .
" essentially , much more has to happen in terms of labor market reform than is laid down in the coalition deal . " raisi n g retireme n t age co n troversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the retirement age in germany is a touchy issue another point of the coalition deal , an increase in the retirement age to 67 from the current 65 , has also proved controversial . walter hirrlinger , head of the social association vdk , said he was against freezing pension hikes for pensioners and raising the working age of employees .
hirrlinger warned the government that it would face a wave of strikes and protests . " when you consider that raising pensions is put off indefinitely and that pensioners can increasingly spend less each year at a time when the inflation rate is over 2 percent , then you ca n't say that it 's really very fair for them -lrb- pensioners -rrb- , " he said . however , raising the retirement age has been strongly welcomed by business leaders . half-hearted measures ? at the same time , some like dieter hundt , head of the employers ' association , pointed out that most of the measures are half-hearted and stop short of a " real bold stroke . " " with tax and social contributions hikes , we 're not going to contribute towards stimulating economic growth , holding on to jobs and creating new ones in germany , " hundt said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just looking ?
germans are n't willing to loosen their purse strings the bleak sentiment was echoed in germany 's struggling retail sector , which has for years been suffering from germans ' tendency to save for a rainy day rather than splurge . hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the retail association said that floundering consumer confidence in germany would be further dampened if the vat hike came into effect , pointing out that it would cost the economy some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28.2 billion -rrb- . " we 're happy that the vat hike will only come into force starting january , 2007 , " pellengahr said .
" that gives us enough time to correspondingly adapt prices .
it 's better to increase vat in one go , rather than spread this 3-percent hike over a longer time frame . " eco n omists slam purpose of vat hike indeed , much of the criticism about the future government 's policy blueprint is centered on the vat hike . but , a look at germany 's neighbors shows that the country 's current rate of 19 percent vat is modest in comparison .
in sweden and denmark , sales tax touches 25 percent . the biggest complaint from economists is that the additional revenues generated by the vat hike are to be used to plug gaping holes in public finances and bring down germany 's ballooning budget deficit rather than to lower non-wage labor costs . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the crunch issues almost two months after an inconclusive election , germany 's major parties have forged a coalition deal for a four-year term under incoming chancellor angela merkel .

" the chinese government started censoring the internet a long time ago , it is not the first time that a blog has been shut down , but it shows again that each time a new form of circulating information is created , the chinese authorities manage to control it and shut it down - and that 's scary . "
chinese jury member zhao jing , better known as michael anti , said he the chinese authorities ' decision was a grave mistake .
" blogs play an important role in freedom of speech , and the fact that the chinese government is censoring them proves how far china is from accepting free speech , " he said .

but the deal does contain a hint of promise that things will gradually get better in germany within the next four-year term of the new government , he said . criticism , but for differe n t reaso n s but , that 's where the good news ends .
many industry leaders are skeptically eyeing the coalition deal , while others complain that it 's simply headed in the wrong direction . the trade unions , in particular , are angry .
the planned hike in value added tax -lrb- vat , or sales tax -rrb- is one target of their ire , the other includes measures to loosen germany 's strict laws protecting employees from dismissal . though nothing fundamental will change about existing job protection legislation , companies will in future be able to keep newcomers on a trial period for longer - for two years instead of the current six months . hans eberhard schleyer , head of the association of german trade , said the planned reforms do n't go far enough . " increasing trial periods to two years may be a step in the right direction , but one has to wait and see , " he said .
" essentially , much more has to happen in terms of labor market reform than is laid down in the coalition deal . " raisi n g retireme n t age co n troversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the retirement age in germany is a touchy issue another point of the coalition deal , an increase in the retirement age to 67 from the current 65 , has also proved controversial . walter hirrlinger , head of the social association vdk , said he was against freezing pension hikes for pensioners and raising the working age of employees .
hirrlinger warned the government that it would face a wave of strikes and protests . " when you consider that raising pensions is put off indefinitely and that pensioners can increasingly spend less each year at a time when the inflation rate is over 2 percent , then you ca n't say that it 's really very fair for them -lrb- pensioners -rrb- , " he said . however , raising the retirement age has been strongly welcomed by business leaders . half-hearted measures ? at the same time , some like dieter hundt , head of the employers ' association , pointed out that most of the measures are half-hearted and stop short of a " real bold stroke . " " with tax and social contributions hikes , we 're not going to contribute towards stimulating economic growth , holding on to jobs and creating new ones in germany , " hundt said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just looking ?
germans are n't willing to loosen their purse strings the bleak sentiment was echoed in germany 's struggling retail sector , which has for years been suffering from germans ' tendency to save for a rainy day rather than splurge . hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the retail association said that floundering consumer confidence in germany would be further dampened if the vat hike came into effect , pointing out that it would cost the economy some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28.2 billion -rrb- . " we 're happy that the vat hike will only come into force starting january , 2007 , " pellengahr said .
" that gives us enough time to correspondingly adapt prices .
it 's better to increase vat in one go , rather than spread this 3-percent hike over a longer time frame . " eco n omists slam purpose of vat hike indeed , much of the criticism about the future government 's policy blueprint is centered on the vat hike . but , a look at germany 's neighbors shows that the country 's current rate of 19 percent vat is modest in comparison .
in sweden and denmark , sales tax touches 25 percent . the biggest complaint from economists is that the additional revenues generated by the vat hike are to be used to plug gaping holes in public finances and bring down germany 's ballooning budget deficit rather than to lower non-wage labor costs . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the crunch issues almost two months after an inconclusive election , germany 's major parties have forged a coalition deal for a four-year term under incoming chancellor angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.11.2005 all-round approval for new coalition pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's almost there the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor-designate angela merkel overwhelmingly approved a new coalition deal monday as did the social democrats and christian social union . the approval of the deal by the conservatives , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , at separate congresses on monday laid the basis for merkel to be installed at the head of a potentially fragile and unwieldy bipartisan government . the endorsements for germany 's political marriage of convenience will likely lead to merkel being sworn in as the country 's first woman chancellor and the first chancellor from the former communist east .
but merkel must still be voted into the position by the bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , on nov .
22 , before she can get to work . approval of the coalition deal will not , of course , be the last of the hard negotiations between the cdu / csu and the spd .
the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .

" the chinese government started censoring the internet a long time ago , it is not the first time that a blog has been shut down , but it shows again that each time a new form of circulating information is created , the chinese authorities manage to control it and shut it down - and that 's scary . "
chinese jury member zhao jing , better known as michael anti , said he the chinese authorities ' decision was a grave mistake .
" blogs play an important role in freedom of speech , and the fact that the chinese government is censoring them proves how far china is from accepting free speech , " he said .

"
chinese jury member zhao jing , better known as michael anti , said he the chinese authorities ' decision was a grave mistake .
" blogs play an important role in freedom of speech , and the fact that the chinese government is censoring them proves how far china is from accepting free speech , " he said .

german soap opera and television institution " lindenstrasse " celebrates its 20th anniversary in december by welcoming a certain stetson-wearing guest star from across the atlantic . the man has done it all : he 's been shot - twice , he 's had numerous extra-marital affairs , lived with a hateful alcoholic wife , run a super-rich texan oil concern and financed a terrorist organization to start a war in the middle east . but all that is in the past for j.r. ewing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2005 helping germany 's neglected children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what goes on behind closed doors remains anyone 's guess when it emerged earlier this year that a hamburg mother had allowed her young child to starve to death , the nation reacted with horror .
since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .
she added there is a clear distinction drawn between physical or medical neglect and an absolute lack of mental stimulation , which can in turn have physical consequences .
in extreme cases , it can lead to a child 's growth becoming stunted with no physiological explanation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy families are no foregone conclusion in modern germany in 2004 alone , more than 17,000 boys and girls were taken away from their families by social services , because they were considered to be at risk . " what goes on behind closed doors is often very dramatic , " siggelkow said .
the berlin vicar added that the impoverished often try and save money by not providing for their children rather than sacrificing themselves . authorities caught betwee n two stools although the violation of parental care is a punishable offence , child welfare authorities often struggle to meet their protective function .
basic constitutional law in germany secures parents the right to bring up their own children , but that said , the state has a constitutional responsibility to monitor education and care . hamburg 's greens and social democrats say that in the case of serious doubt , a child 's welfare should come before parental rights .
both parties are calling for the nine regular medical checks currently offered to children between birth and the age of five , to be made mandatory .
as it stands , many parents do n't take their children to the last three examinations , which politicians say could help to curb any increase in neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany offers parents a series of thorough check-ups for their kids hermann-josef kahl of germany 's professional association of pediatricians said he believes the way forward could be gentle sanctions for those parents who do n't take their children to their medical check-ups . " it would be possible to link the payment of family allowance or the distribution of kindergarten or university places to the number of check-ups attended , " he said .
in order to underscore the importance of the health checks , the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- is organizing an awareness campaign . help before pu n ishme n t but abelmann-vollmer said she is not convinced that making medical check-ups for children obligatory is such a good idea . " the parents of neglected children are already up against it and bogging them down in yet more duties , does n't have a good effect on the children , " she said . instead , she suggested a diversity of low-threshold options , such as mother and child cafes and toddlers ' groups , which offer help at an early stage before a situation has the chance to escalate . what is clear is that germany has to take some action .
siggelkow said he has long been expecting a case of starvation in berlin , and would not be remotely surprised to see severely neglected children dumped outside the " arche " one day in the future . johanna tüntsch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .

since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .
she added there is a clear distinction drawn between physical or medical neglect and an absolute lack of mental stimulation , which can in turn have physical consequences .

" what goes on behind closed doors is often very dramatic , " siggelkow said .
the berlin vicar added that the impoverished often try and save money by not providing for their children rather than sacrificing themselves . authorities caught betwee n two stools although the violation of parental care is a punishable offence , child welfare authorities often struggle to meet their protective function .
basic constitutional law in germany secures parents the right to bring up their own children , but that said , the state has a constitutional responsibility to monitor education and care . hamburg 's greens and social democrats say that in the case of serious doubt , a child 's welfare should come before parental rights .
both parties are calling for the nine regular medical checks currently offered to children between birth and the age of five , to be made mandatory .
as it stands , many parents do n't take their children to the last three examinations , which politicians say could help to curb any increase in neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany offers parents a series of thorough check-ups for their kids hermann-josef kahl of germany 's professional association of pediatricians said he believes the way forward could be gentle sanctions for those parents who do n't take their children to their medical check-ups . " it would be possible to link the payment of family allowance or the distribution of kindergarten or university places to the number of check-ups attended , " he said .
in order to underscore the importance of the health checks , the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- is organizing an awareness campaign . help before pu n ishme n t but abelmann-vollmer said she is not convinced that making medical check-ups for children obligatory is such a good idea . " the parents of neglected children are already up against it and bogging them down in yet more duties , does n't have a good effect on the children , " she said . instead , she suggested a diversity of low-threshold options , such as mother and child cafes and toddlers ' groups , which offer help at an early stage before a situation has the chance to escalate . what is clear is that germany has to take some action .
siggelkow said he has long been expecting a case of starvation in berlin , and would not be remotely surprised to see severely neglected children dumped outside the " arche " one day in the future . johanna tüntsch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .

the performance in montevideo was a world away from the 3-0 collapse the aussies suffered in 2001 . twice world cup winners uruguay were made to battle for 90 minutes and ended the game with only dario rodriguez 's 37th minute goal and plenty of bruises to take down under for the second-leg . tri n idadia n s draw despite domi n ati n g trinidad & tobago were held to a 1-1 draw with bahrain despite being the more dangerous team .
christopher birchall struck a stunning 25 meter rocket to equalize with 12 minutes left and cancel out salman husein 's header which had given bahrain the lead in the 72nd minute . twenty-seven nations , including hosts germany and champions brazil have already qualified for the finals and the complete line-up will be finalized on wednesday ahead of the draw for the finals which will be held in leipzig on dec .

" the chinese government started censoring the internet a long time ago , it is not the first time that a blog has been shut down , but it shows again that each time a new form of circulating information is created , the chinese authorities manage to control it and shut it down - and that 's scary . "
chinese jury member zhao jing , better known as michael anti , said he the chinese authorities ' decision was a grave mistake .
" blogs play an important role in freedom of speech , and the fact that the chinese government is censoring them proves how far china is from accepting free speech , " he said .

the bobs jury members ' protest comes just days before the world summit on the information society begins on nov .

" the chinese government started censoring the internet a long time ago , it is not the first time that a blog has been shut down , but it shows again that each time a new form of circulating information is created , the chinese authorities manage to control it and shut it down - and that 's scary . "
chinese jury member zhao jing , better known as michael anti , said he the chinese authorities ' decision was a grave mistake .
" blogs play an important role in freedom of speech , and the fact that the chinese government is censoring them proves how far china is from accepting free speech , " he said .

but the deal does contain a hint of promise that things will gradually get better in germany within the next four-year term of the new government , he said . criticism , but for differe n t reaso n s but , that 's where the good news ends .
many industry leaders are skeptically eyeing the coalition deal , while others complain that it 's simply headed in the wrong direction . the trade unions , in particular , are angry .
the planned hike in value added tax -lrb- vat , or sales tax -rrb- is one target of their ire , the other includes measures to loosen germany 's strict laws protecting employees from dismissal . though nothing fundamental will change about existing job protection legislation , companies will in future be able to keep newcomers on a trial period for longer - for two years instead of the current six months . hans eberhard schleyer , head of the association of german trade , said the planned reforms do n't go far enough . " increasing trial periods to two years may be a step in the right direction , but one has to wait and see , " he said .
" essentially , much more has to happen in terms of labor market reform than is laid down in the coalition deal . " raisi n g retireme n t age co n troversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising the retirement age in germany is a touchy issue another point of the coalition deal , an increase in the retirement age to 67 from the current 65 , has also proved controversial . walter hirrlinger , head of the social association vdk , said he was against freezing pension hikes for pensioners and raising the working age of employees .

and the bad ?
most of it is on a fast-track out of the country . considering the sorry state of the economy , the country 's contemporary art boom is one ray of light on an otherwise bleak horizon . " germany is currently the second largest contemporary art market after the us , " said michael neff , director of art frankfurt .
" art is more ' in ' than ever .
it 's drawing more and more buyers .
that boosts prices , which in turn boosts publicity . " investment and personal prestige consumers might have tightened their belts over the last few years , but the german art market appears to be immune to the national penny-pinching . according to alexander sandmeier from the german art trade association , it 's largely because art has a unique status . " the main aspect of buying art is not so much financial investment as pleasure , " he explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean arp 's " femme " went under the hammer in 2003 " art is not a standard consumer good , " he said .
" it 's like books .
if the economy is depressed you drive your car a few years longer , but you do n't stop reading books .
it 's the same with art .
and in the face of constant bad news , valuing art highly is perhaps more important than ever . " " art has a lot to do with prestige , " art market expert wolfgang wilke told the daily faz .
" despite the stock market crash of 2000 , the art market has remained astonishingly stable .
there seems to be a new factor , which is that people are interested in buying art for reasons which are not purely economic .
when times are tough , people tend to seek new modes of self-expression , such as collecting art … .the art market has a great future - not just as a passion , but as a financial investment . " pushing german art werner tammen from the association of berlin galleries agrees that art is an increasingly coveted commodity primarily because of its cultural cachet . " 95 percent of art is bought because people see it as a personal enrichment , " he observed .
" associating oneself with creativity is increasingly a cultural necessity , it 's an integral part of cultural awareness .
artistic participation is a key way to garner social respect . " equally , he stressed , it 's a key way to oil rusty economic wheels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors flock to the annual art forum in berlin " in the past few years , a lot of gallery owners have made substantial efforts to promote the label german art on the international market " he said .
" it 's now paying off , and this art is very sought after at international art fairs , which has positive economic repercussions for germany .
international collectors are eager visitors here , because there 's so much art being produced . " a lost opportunity " but in other respects , the situation is appalling , " he went on .
" public acquisition budgets in the capital have been cut back to virtually nothing . " the consequences are potentially disastrous . " german art is being bought by international museums rather than german ones , " said tammen .
" art made here in the last five to ten years is simply not represented in our museums . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch 's " waldbahn " movements such as the new leipzig school as well as a number of up and coming berlin artists might be the toast of the international art world , but they 're more popular abroad than at home . " museums tend to step in and buy only after prices have already skyrocketed , " pointed out tammen .
" given that budgets are n't likely to increase in the foreseeable future , there 's a serious possibility that forty years from now , museums collections will give the impression there was no art being made at the moment , when in fact the current art scene could n't be more vibrant . " " we have to watch out we do n't lose our cultural heritage because it 's being snapped up by international buyers , " he added .
" there is n't a single museum in berlin right now that 's in a position to acquire recent art , because there are simply no funds available . " refocusing urban policy " politicians completely underestimate the importance of art as an economic factor , " pointed out alexander sandmeier .
" it 's a question of changing perceptions . " this could involve adopting what prospect magazine has dubbed the " cool city strategy . "
according to the arts community , promoting culture rather than commerce is an efficient way of turning an economy round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visiting moma in 2004 exhibition boosted tourist numbers " basically , arts and culture is the capital 's trump card , " insisted tammen .
" when berlin makes an international splash , it does so with its arts and culture .
so it should be better promoted .
it 's what attracts investors to the city , who in turn pay taxes here .
it has long-term benefits .
if you have a good product , then you market it - it 's just economic good sense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.11.2005 art market bucks economic trend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is haemorrhaging homegrown art the good news is that despite germany 's economic woes , the contemporary art market is booming .
and the bad ?
most of it is on a fast-track out of the country . considering the sorry state of the economy , the country 's contemporary art boom is one ray of light on an otherwise bleak horizon . " germany is currently the second largest contemporary art market after the us , " said michael neff , director of art frankfurt .
" art is more ' in ' than ever .
it 's drawing more and more buyers .
that boosts prices , which in turn boosts publicity . " investment and personal prestige consumers might have tightened their belts over the last few years , but the german art market appears to be immune to the national penny-pinching . according to alexander sandmeier from the german art trade association , it 's largely because art has a unique status . " the main aspect of buying art is not so much financial investment as pleasure , " he explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean arp 's " femme " went under the hammer in 2003 " art is not a standard consumer good , " he said .
" it 's like books .
if the economy is depressed you drive your car a few years longer , but you do n't stop reading books .
it 's the same with art .
and in the face of constant bad news , valuing art highly is perhaps more important than ever . " " art has a lot to do with prestige , " art market expert wolfgang wilke told the daily faz .
" despite the stock market crash of 2000 , the art market has remained astonishingly stable .
there seems to be a new factor , which is that people are interested in buying art for reasons which are not purely economic .
when times are tough , people tend to seek new modes of self-expression , such as collecting art … .the art market has a great future - not just as a passion , but as a financial investment . " pushing german art werner tammen from the association of berlin galleries agrees that art is an increasingly coveted commodity primarily because of its cultural cachet . " 95 percent of art is bought because people see it as a personal enrichment , " he observed .
" associating oneself with creativity is increasingly a cultural necessity , it 's an integral part of cultural awareness .
artistic participation is a key way to garner social respect . " equally , he stressed , it 's a key way to oil rusty economic wheels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors flock to the annual art forum in berlin " in the past few years , a lot of gallery owners have made substantial efforts to promote the label german art on the international market " he said .
" it 's now paying off , and this art is very sought after at international art fairs , which has positive economic repercussions for germany .
international collectors are eager visitors here , because there 's so much art being produced . " a lost opportunity " but in other respects , the situation is appalling , " he went on .
" public acquisition budgets in the capital have been cut back to virtually nothing . " the consequences are potentially disastrous . " german art is being bought by international museums rather than german ones , " said tammen .
" art made here in the last five to ten years is simply not represented in our museums . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch 's " waldbahn " movements such as the new leipzig school as well as a number of up and coming berlin artists might be the toast of the international art world , but they 're more popular abroad than at home . " museums tend to step in and buy only after prices have already skyrocketed , " pointed out tammen .
" given that budgets are n't likely to increase in the foreseeable future , there 's a serious possibility that forty years from now , museums collections will give the impression there was no art being made at the moment , when in fact the current art scene could n't be more vibrant . " " we have to watch out we do n't lose our cultural heritage because it 's being snapped up by international buyers , " he added .
" there is n't a single museum in berlin right now that 's in a position to acquire recent art , because there are simply no funds available . " refocusing urban policy " politicians completely underestimate the importance of art as an economic factor , " pointed out alexander sandmeier .
" it 's a question of changing perceptions . " this could involve adopting what prospect magazine has dubbed the " cool city strategy . "
according to the arts community , promoting culture rather than commerce is an efficient way of turning an economy round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the visiting moma in 2004 exhibition boosted tourist numbers " basically , arts and culture is the capital 's trump card , " insisted tammen .
" when berlin makes an international splash , it does so with its arts and culture .
so it should be better promoted .
it 's what attracts investors to the city , who in turn pay taxes here .

"
german soap opera and television institution " lindenstrasse " celebrates its 20th anniversary in december by welcoming a certain stetson-wearing guest star from across the atlantic . the man has done it all : he 's been shot - twice , he 's had numerous extra-marital affairs , lived with a hateful alcoholic wife , run a super-rich texan oil concern and financed a terrorist organization to start a war in the middle east . but all that is in the past for j.r. ewing .
now the 74-year-old former tycoon is content to spend his remaining days as a world traveler . how do we know this ?
well , according to numerous press reports , the ultimate tv villain is due to show up in an episode of german cult soap " lindenstrasse " as a customer of helga beimer , the show 's matriarchal travel agent . tv bad guy o n the ru n i n germa n y ? lindenstrasse sources are tight-lipped as to why j.r. is so far from " dallas " and what he may be doing in germany .
maybe he is fleeing an increasingly threatening paternity suit or perhaps avoiding indictment over his part in a war in a certain oil rich country . whatever the reason for j.r. being thousands of miles from his beloved south fork ranch , frau beimer is certainly looking forward to serving his needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marie-luise marjan with producer hans w. geissendörfer " i am very excited , " dallas fan marie-luise marjan , who plays helga beimer , told the bild tabloid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.11.2005 all-round approval for new coalition pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's almost there the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor-designate angela merkel overwhelmingly approved a new coalition deal monday as did the social democrats and christian social union . the approval of the deal by the conservatives , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , at separate congresses on monday laid the basis for merkel to be installed at the head of a potentially fragile and unwieldy bipartisan government . the endorsements for germany 's political marriage of convenience will likely lead to merkel being sworn in as the country 's first woman chancellor and the first chancellor from the former communist east .
but merkel must still be voted into the position by the bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , on nov .
22 , before she can get to work . approval of the coalition deal will not , of course , be the last of the hard negotiations between the cdu / csu and the spd .
the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .
she added there is a clear distinction drawn between physical or medical neglect and an absolute lack of mental stimulation , which can in turn have physical consequences .
in extreme cases , it can lead to a child 's growth becoming stunted with no physiological explanation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy families are no foregone conclusion in modern germany in 2004 alone , more than 17,000 boys and girls were taken away from their families by social services , because they were considered to be at risk . " what goes on behind closed doors is often very dramatic , " siggelkow said .
the berlin vicar added that the impoverished often try and save money by not providing for their children rather than sacrificing themselves . authorities caught betwee n two stools although the violation of parental care is a punishable offence , child welfare authorities often struggle to meet their protective function .
basic constitutional law in germany secures parents the right to bring up their own children , but that said , the state has a constitutional responsibility to monitor education and care . hamburg 's greens and social democrats say that in the case of serious doubt , a child 's welfare should come before parental rights .
both parties are calling for the nine regular medical checks currently offered to children between birth and the age of five , to be made mandatory .
as it stands , many parents do n't take their children to the last three examinations , which politicians say could help to curb any increase in neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany offers parents a series of thorough check-ups for their kids hermann-josef kahl of germany 's professional association of pediatricians said he believes the way forward could be gentle sanctions for those parents who do n't take their children to their medical check-ups . " it would be possible to link the payment of family allowance or the distribution of kindergarten or university places to the number of check-ups attended , " he said .
in order to underscore the importance of the health checks , the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- is organizing an awareness campaign . help before pu n ishme n t but abelmann-vollmer said she is not convinced that making medical check-ups for children obligatory is such a good idea . " the parents of neglected children are already up against it and bogging them down in yet more duties , does n't have a good effect on the children , " she said . instead , she suggested a diversity of low-threshold options , such as mother and child cafes and toddlers ' groups , which offer help at an early stage before a situation has the chance to escalate . what is clear is that germany has to take some action .
siggelkow said he has long been expecting a case of starvation in berlin , and would not be remotely surprised to see severely neglected children dumped outside the " arche " one day in the future . johanna tüntsch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .

since then one man has been working to better the lot of underprivileged youngsters . for the past several months , the local vicar from the parish which was once home to the seven-year-old girl has been working towards the creation of a youth centre which would offer its visitors care and commitment . " the plans have come a long way already , but what we still need are sponsors , " vicar thies hagge said .
he is hoping to establish a place which offers safety to children from troubled homes , a place like the " arche " or arc , which was set up by vicar bernd siggelkow in berlin 10 years ago . but with between 100,000 and 300,000 children in germany deemed neglected , such projects can never be anything more than a drop in the ocean . but what constitutes neglect ?
katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .

the berlin vicar added that the impoverished often try and save money by not providing for their children rather than sacrificing themselves . authorities caught betwee n two stools although the violation of parental care is a punishable offence , child welfare authorities often struggle to meet their protective function .
basic constitutional law in germany secures parents the right to bring up their own children , but that said , the state has a constitutional responsibility to monitor education and care . hamburg 's greens and social democrats say that in the case of serious doubt , a child 's welfare should come before parental rights .
both parties are calling for the nine regular medical checks currently offered to children between birth and the age of five , to be made mandatory .

" it would be possible to link the payment of family allowance or the distribution of kindergarten or university places to the number of check-ups attended , " he said .
in order to underscore the importance of the health checks , the federal centre for health education -lrb- bzga -rrb- is organizing an awareness campaign . help before pu n ishme n t but abelmann-vollmer said she is not convinced that making medical check-ups for children obligatory is such a good idea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.11.2005 all-round approval for new coalition pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's almost there the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor-designate angela merkel overwhelmingly approved a new coalition deal monday as did the social democrats and christian social union . the approval of the deal by the conservatives , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , at separate congresses on monday laid the basis for merkel to be installed at the head of a potentially fragile and unwieldy bipartisan government . the endorsements for germany 's political marriage of convenience will likely lead to merkel being sworn in as the country 's first woman chancellor and the first chancellor from the former communist east .
but merkel must still be voted into the position by the bundestag , the lower chamber of parliament , on nov .
22 , before she can get to work . approval of the coalition deal will not , of course , be the last of the hard negotiations between the cdu / csu and the spd .
the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

the parties may have come up with a proposal all of them can live with after almost two months of haggling over power , but the machinations will continue as the government takes its seats in leading germany . industry gunning for coalition deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard bargaining of the last two months is unlikely to end here the pact sealed by merkel 's conservatives and their longtime rivals , the spd of outgoing chancellor gerhard schroeder , details a sudden and dramatic consolidation of the german budget in 2007 , driven by a rise in sales tax .
it is a deal that has angered german industry and the new opposition parties . the criticism is focused on the agreement to bring germany 's budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a massive undertaking requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.96 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues - and the means of getting there . a huge portion of that money will come from a 3 percent rise in value-added tax in 2007 - a move some economists fear could hit weak german consumption and make it tough for the coalition to achieve its chief goal of cutting unemployment , currently at 11.6 percent . business figures have condemned the pact , fearing the higher taxes will hit german consumers , and the green party and free-market liberal fdp have painted it as a betrayal of the promises the ruling partners made during the election campaign . discontent in the conservative ranks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with rebel members on top of everything else there are also rumblings of discontent within the ranks of the coalition parties themselves .
some conservatives are dismayed with the concessions merkel made to the spd in her quest to become chancellor . while agreeing to loosen job protection measures and cut payroll costs , the cdu rebels say the most damaging concessions were the rise in taxes for top earners and the dumping of reforms in governing wage negotiations however , the voices of dissent remained silent on monday as just three of over 100 members voted against the pact and one abstained . schroeder tells tearful spd : take the deal schroeder made an impassioned plea to his party earlier in the day which had some members visibly moved .
at the party meeting in the southwestern city of karlsruhe , the outgoing chancellor urged his party to accept the pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder made an emotional plea for his party to approve the pact " no one is forcing anyone to love this grand coalition or to cheer about it , " schroeder said , as some of the crowd dabbed away tears .
but the agreement contained the undeniable signature of the spd and was germany 's only chance for a stable government , he said . " i urge you therefore to give your broad approval , " schroeder said . and they did .
during the two and a half hours of discussion , the delegates expressed little criticism , demonstrating a nearly united front of approval for the coalition .
in the open ballot , 518 delegates backed the deal , 15 voted ' no ' and five abstained .
the social democrats also overwhelmingly put their weight behind outgoing party chairman franz muentefering becoming merkel 's deputy and approved the remaining eight spd cabinet designates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said he was sorry the csu voted unanimously in favor of the coalition plans at its congress in munich .
csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who has been under fire from critics both inside and outside his party ever since he unexpectedly backed out of his position as designated economy minister in the new cabinet , took the opportunity to apologize . " i 'm sorry that my decision put our party and all of you here in a … difficult situation , " he told the roughly 200 delegates. ncy / nda editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry not amused by coalition deal as germany 's parties debate the endorsement of the new coalition deal , the country 's business leaders are n't pleased about planned tax hikes , fearing it might strangle a nascent economic recovery .

katarina abelmann-vollmer of the german association for child protection -lrb- dksb -rrb- said that is not easy to define .

it increased to 1.86 trillion yen -lrb- $ 15.73bn ; £ 8.99bn -rrb- , thanks to income from overseas investments offsetting a narrowing trade gap .
the official figures from the japanese ministry of finance were better than market expectations .
analysts had been expecting a slight year on year fall of 2.6 % .
the investment income surplus was up 33.5 % on the year to 1.013 trillion yen ; while the surplus in trade in goods and services fell to 862.7bn yen .
august 's overall current account surplus figure fell by 15.6 % due to a peak in oil prices , but the global cost of crude has since fallen back .
growing economy japan 's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in the third quarter , boosted by strong domestic demand , official figures showed last week .
japanese gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose by 0.4 % in the three months to september , the cabinet office said .
that brought japan 's growth rate for the year to an annualised 1.7 % , well above forecasts for a figure of 1 % .
analysts said the pace of growth would help ease deflation , which has gripped the economy for more than seven years .

a helpline is being launched to help the growing number of parents whose children are learning welsh , but who do not speak the language themselves .
the service , staffed by former teachers , offers advice on how to help with homework set in welsh and assistance with vocabulary .
it launches at ysgol gynradd gymraeg casnewydd in newport on monday .
headteacher gwenda roberts said : " i think it 's an extra provision that will come in very useful for parents . "
the welsh language board has chosen the school in south-east wales because it is in one of the more anglicised parts of wales and has a high proportion of parents who do not speak welsh .
the helpline is currently a service for parents with children between the ages of seven and 11 -lrb- key stage 2 -rrb- , but it is hoped to expand the service to the secondary sector during 2006 .
parents of pupils in the school will be taking part in the launch , which will be led by alun pugh am , the minister for welsh language .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- set the entertainment news agenda bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture monday , 14 november 2005 , 08:34 gmt set the entertainment news agenda is there something you feel passionate , angry or excited about in the entertainment world , which has not been given the coverage it deserves ?
the bbc news website 's entertainment section wants to reflect the concerns and interests of the most important people in the entertainment industry - you .
we want to find out what you consider to be the biggest issues and hottest topics across the arts , music , film , tv and radio .
you may have a gripe about ticket prices , arts funding or downloading , or you may have discovered a fantastic new scene , initiative or innovation that you and your friends love - but nobody else knows about .
we will publish the best ideas and invite other readers to share their views and experiences .
we want your messages to generate discussion and , with a bit of luck , issues and themes will emerge .
the bbc news website 's entertainment reporter ian youngs will follow up the most interesting with full-blown stories and features on the site .
we are also looking for bona fide news stories that you think warrant investigation or exposure - so let us know what 's on your mind .
due to technical difficulties , messages sent before 1530 gmt on sunday 6 november were not received .
i have two gripes , both about dvds .
firstly i bought two new films on dvd recently - kung fu hustle & ong bak .
they are both good films , with great fighting scenes .
as they are chinese and thai , they have dubbed english audio .
kung fu hustle 's english audio is good , it sounds like chinese people that can speak english , which gives a more authentic feel to the film but ong bak 's english audio sounds like the cast of eastenders or emmerdale talking , it 's quite off putting .
for the amount of money films make , a little extra effort would not really make a dent in the profits .
my second moan is dvd prices - i was recently at stansted airport , where there is a sign outside the hmv store that says ' tax free prices for everyone ' .
i went in to see if i could pick up any bargains , i was shocked as the prices i was seeing were more expensive than prices i had seen in an hmv store in peterborough two days earlier .
how is this possible ?
is there some kind of airport tax added before the tax free offer is applied ?
surely they know people will notice .
paul stewart , chaunay , france regional restrictions on dvds make me very angry too !
i live in the usa but i love cinema from all over the world .
i find it very frustrating that i ca n't buy a dvd of , say , an australian movie or a british movie online , and guarantee i can play it here .
why ca n't dvds be like cds ?
not all of us are pirating these things - we just want to be able to see a wide range of world cinema at home , especially movies which may not even have been released in theatres here in the usa .
isabelle , brit in usa podcasts .
more people should know and listen to these radio talks shows , they are awesome !
matt , spokane u.s.a. i think the greatest problem with the entertainment industry as a whole is twofold .
one is the rampant growth of copyright violation , both in terms of laws lengthening the years a work stays under copyright and astounding ways companies try to protect their " intellectual properties . "
this is an industry that believes its customers are pirates who engage in " copyright theft " first and honest users second .
fair use rights have been thrown to the roadside for the benefit of business to increase profit margins .
it 's a telling soundbite when the head of sony says that " most people do n't know what a rootkit is , so why are they worried about it ? "
as the moral goes , " the more you squeeze your fingers , the more will slip through your grasp . "
kevin mason , tucson , arizona , usa having serious societal issues depicted in films -lrb- that might be released 2 or 3 time a year let 's say -rrb- is one thing however when the same issues -lrb- sexual / physical abuse for example -rrb- are turned into tv programs that air nightly in family homes and are called ' entertainment ' i am concerned about the long term effect on our communities subsequent perception of their own everyday world .
i wonder how we can on one hand react so vehemently to such emotional issues on our doorstep and yet have it turned into profit making ' entertainment ' without so much as a whimper ?
peter mackay , sydney australia -lrb- born in liverpool uk -rrb- booking fees on top of already expensive ticket prices - i booked four shows -lrb- two tickets for each show -rrb- and got charged a fee for each ticket on top of the ticket price .
also - why do n't they make it illegal to sell any ticket for more than its face value ?
surely that would stop touts and other crooks from thriving .
mick h , swindon wilts while i can see the many benefits of digital broadcasting , what does concern me is that not all viewers / listeners are equal .
where i live , i can not use a digital top set box or use a dab radio .
i 'm therefore forced to use rupert murdoch 's sky dish .
unfortunately many new channels that are available on freeview i can not receive unless i take out a full subscription with sky .
unless there is a commitment to an equity in public broadcasting delivery the technology is going alienate many people .
stuart barker , derbyshire , uk i 'm glad that grokster has closed , mainly because it will be interesting to see who the music people blame for loss of earnings if all the p2p programs closed down .
i 'm also mad about ticket touts .
it should be illegal to ticket tout , especially after the live 8 incident where callous people were selling live 8 tickets on ebay for massive profits in order to line their own pockets .
carl robertson , swindon , uk i object to laws being written at the behest of the entertainment industry which prevent me from performing legal actions .
i have the legal right to copy a dvd from the disk to another format yet the dmca and similar laws prevent me from doing this as to do so i would have to break the encryption on the disk .
this also prevents me from producing compilation clip disks to use in graduate film studies classes .
switching disks and finding points in films can cost up to 10 minutes per lecture , especially when disks prevent you from skipping the logos , trailers and copyright messages at the start .
richard feilden , santa barbara , usa copyright protection is becoming a joke with large companies having far too much influence on particularly american laws , which europe often rolls over for at some later point .
since piracy became prevalent -lrb- which i do not approve of -rrb- we have reasonably priced dvd 's and cd 's , improved speed of release , and simultaneous availability to stop the consumer being fleeced every which way possible .
i do not approve of piracy , but i applaud the results that piracy has had in putting these companies in their place , and i utterly resent their increasingly illegal attempts to squash us back down .
richard munro , uk you know what really grinds my gears bbc ?
dvd regions and the prospect of the new generation of blu ray having similar technology .
what is the point of regional coding ?
we supposedly live in a global capitalist market and yet there is a restriction on the international flow of information .
what i do n't understand is why people thought that it would be a good idea .
the most unpleasant thing it could is increase price competition for dvds .
this should be made illegal .
ross pearson , london , uk / athens , usa region restrictions on dvd players .
i legally purchase dvds from us and uk .
my computer dvd restricts the region -lrb- after 5 switches -rrb- what in reality are they trying to protect ?
i have bought a laptop to travel with .
it 's stupid that i am restricted on playing dvd from the countries i visit .
roo , usa the day dawneth when the tv and home computer become one .
i find the reception in my area bad , and no matter what i do ca n't find a good signal - hence i do n't watch much tv .
i am looking forward to using the new broadband tv service from the bbc when they roll it out next year .
for me this will enable me to watch my favourite programs , and like radio online i can watch it in my time .
we are living on the crest of the digital revolution , and our children will look back in school and wonder where it all happened .
we are living history , and through our computers we are shaping our world .
rachel saunders , preston , uk whatever happened to our national sense of pride in our theatres ?
in the first half of the 20th century , we had such luminaries as george bernard shaw , noel coward and laurence olivier , quite rightly regarded as legends in their own time because of their sheer ability to hold their own slightly skewed mirrors up to life .
in shakespeare 's time , people would cram into the stalls of the globe and others like it , just to see what new spectacle of emotion and fantasy would be brought alive before their very eyes .
today , we have , at the height of our cultural mountain ... yet another half-hearted , mangled production of a.n.other american playwright 's ' classic ' , naturally featuring a cast which consists primarily of hollywood ' here today , gone tomorrow ' tabloid darlings determined to ' tick off the stage ' before their 15 minutes is up .
meanwhile , that which is going on in the fringe venues of our capital city goes largely ignored by critics , in spite of the fact that it is often of far better all-round quality than the technical jiggery of the west end musicals .
krystina nellis , london , uk surely it is now time to move eastenders from its current slot to one that is beyond the watershed .
if this were a movie it would be deemed to be pg , particularly given the escalation in violence .
it does not make pleasant family viewing and is certainly not providing suitable storylines for those without adult supervision .
constant fisticuffs , gun toting gangsters and scenes of threatening behaviour towards females is not something the bbc should expose children to .
glenn , london , uk despite what the cinema adverts claim , copying a dvd is not stealing ...
it 's copyright infringement .
it is perfectly possible to download material you would not consider a high-enough priority to buy , even if downloading were not an option .
providing you leech and do not redistribute the material , doing so neither robs the author of the original content , nor of any revenue .
the corporations can get away with such falsehoods as to speak out as a consumer is to admit liability of copyright infringement !
anon , uk i buy both cds and vinyl records ; i buy a lot of vinyl records .
in order to mix up my music from two different sources i use mini disc component players hooked up to my amplifier .
i ca n't use i-pods or similar devices because i have no way of recording my music onto them using the amplifier / stereo .
i need to record all of my music , one time , onto one large database of some sort .
i love digital technology but have no intention to stop buying vinyl records so i really need a device which plugs into my amplifier so that i can record from both sources and store all my music in one place .
mike staley , hong kong i was so delighted to find that the fabulous eric clapton is touring again next year and returning to the royal albert hall in may .
i was stunned when i found that an arena ticket was going to cost me £ 60 plus a booking fee ! !
i am a huge fan and as such i 've paid the money as i want to see him play live , but , how can promoters and concert venues justify this kind of ticket price and what is the booking fee for ?
administration of the booking ?
is n't that what they 're paid to do ?
surely we spend enough as it is on albums and singles without having to stump up such high prices to see a live performance .
what do the artists think about this situation ?
gary bowyer , sutton , surrey what really annoys me about the fall of p2p networks is the fact that you may wish for your music to be heard by a wide audience - if like me you are in an unsigned band .
this medium can be ideal if you want to get your music out there .
i really despise the companies and artists who are totally against p2p .
in my opinion people should make music for the love of it and not expect automatically money in return , they should be honoured that people actually want to listen to their work .
anthony lloyd , warrington , england as a book publisher i 'm certain that big changes are around the corner for readers .
those changes will be led by fashion and the younger generation : give them an ipod-style ebook reader that is cool to carry , and they will realise the advantage at school and college of carrying one ' book ' around with them instead of dozens .
that one gadget can contain thousands of books - imagine taking one ' book ' on holiday containing everything you want to read instead of a heavy pile of novels .
if it takes off like the ipod there will be a craze for downloading ebooks .
the only snag is that the majority of books currently in print are not yet converted to ebooks and it will take a few years for the industry to catch up .
my company has converted to ebook formats 200 of its titles so far , but we have a long way to go .
stewart ferris , chichester , uk i am deaf and have been denied access to the professional theatre for 50-odd years apart from my learning lines and appearing in various amateur productions .
now we have stagetext who caption what is being said or sung by the actors / performers and even effects are written in as well -lrb- eg crash , bang , wallop ! -rrb-
stagetext was born in 2000 and now gives deaf people 100 % access to the theatre where they are actively involved .
but only a few productions are captioned and it is still an exercise in military planning to know which performance , where and at what time to go to in order to see / read these rare but treasured captioned shows .
michael theobald , london my family rented out ' valiant ' last night on dvd , and i noticed that the trailers at the start could not be skipped !
this also seems to be standard in disney titles on dvd , and i find it very frustrating not being able to control what i am watching on this medium .
steve , uk how can the download industry justify charging the same price for albums as buying the cd ?
the quality and lack of artwork and box plus all the associated packaging costs should bring the price down for mp3 quite considerably .
i do not buy any downloads because of this blatant rip-off .
david harpin , st albans , uk today i read about the grokster p2p service being forced to declare itself illegal .
what the entertainment industry fails to realise is that people use p2p to download copyrighted material because there is no " legal " way of doing so .
the success of itunes proves that once such a " legal " way is provided , take-up will be massive .
the tv and movie industries need to bring out their own versions of such systems in order to cut piracy .
jack , uk a big bugbear of mine are the extra ' fees ' for buying tickets for gigs or theatre .
there is an extortionate ' booking fee ' -lrb- especially when you buy online , and do all the work -rrb- , postage fees etc .
one time i bought a ticket of £ 8 face value , yet my credit card was charged approx £ 14 .
dave m , bedington , surrey , uk television advertising is not being viewed since the introduction of tivo and sky + , website advertising is n't being viewed , simply over-looked -lrb- we are more interested in the articles , not the flashy banners -rrb- and radio advertising just do n't exert themselves as much as they could !
the advertising and product placement industry is changing for the better , and with dynamic directions such as product placement in songs or even advertising within computer-games markets , we are able to adapt and work on having subliminal advertising .
this is something the world has always been appalled at , but i personally do n't think that this is anything to worry about .
mark hendrikx , london & berlin microsoft allow licence buyers to install there office software on both one desktop pc and one laptop , this is on the understanding that if the user is using the laptop they wo n't be using the desktop and vice versa .
perhaps the music industry should be looking at this also .
martin sherrit , aberdeen , scotland my main gripe is fair use of music that i have legally bought .
i 'm more than happy to pay out for new cds , but begrudge being told how i can use those cds for personal listening .
i think a policy of ' fair use ' needs to be adopted from the perspective of being able to rip cds that one has bought in order to play the music on another medium - such as an ipod .
i 'm hardly going to listen to the latest eric clapton album on cd and ipod at the same time !
there also needs to be more pressure placed on the music companies for supplying and selling cds that do not conform to the red book audio standard - ie they contain some form of copyright protection .
therefore , they should not carry the compact disc digital audio logo and also should not be marketed as audio cds , instead as cd-roms that carry audio tracks .
neil sherin , portsmouth , uk i am an unpublished novelist looking to the future of the publishing industry and staking my career on what i think is coming our way .
with the music industry reeling from the continuous onslaught from technology stripping away their business models , not much is said about the coming storm in the publishing world .
the only reason that publishing appears to be immune from the phenomenon -lrb- mass-migration to downloadable books -rrb- is that most people hate reading for extended periods on screen .
while many will be tired of the old mantra that we will all be reading electronic books in the near future ; this time it really is imminent .
sony , with its ill-conceived librie , demonstrates that the technology is here now .
if a far-sighted company followed apple 's example -lrb- ipod -rrb- to produce a device for readers using paper-like screens and -lrb- like apple -rrb- focused on selling the device instead of shoring up old business models , the resulting change in the publishing landscape would make that in the music industry seem glacial .
right out of the gate , there are thousands of classics available free from the gutenberg project - a great temptation to migrate to a well executed , paper-like device for all but the most bookish luddites on the planet .
in february i started the world 's first podcast-only novel and the first written straight to podcast .
my plan is to use this medium to grow an audience while keeping control of my work .
although produced directly to audiobook , tom corven is a traditional novel and its ultimate destination is in print .
i finished the tale last sunday and cast it to a small but respectable listener-base of approximately 2,500 people .
paul story , glasgow , scotland i do n't think british actors are paid the same amount as american " celebrities " and find this unfair .
british actors are far more talented and versatile than most of their american counterparts .

by tom bishop bbc news entertainment reporter madonna has headed back to the disco for her new album , confessions on a dancefloor , which is released in the uk on monday .
it has earned her some of the best reviews of her 22-year career .
in stark contrast to 2003 's introspective american life album , she has dusted off her glitterball , strapped on her pink stilettos and sampled abba on latest hit single hung up .
madonna embraced new york club culture in the early 1980s has madonna reinvigorated her music career , or is she merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material ?
" dance music fans may be unconvinced by madonna 's new image as it no longer reflects her real life , " says dj magazine 's features editor carl loben .
" madonna embraced the early stages of new york club culture in the 1980s but i doubt she has been into a club for years . "
respected producer however , mr loben says madonna was very astute to work on her new album with stuart price , the respected producer and remixer behind dance acts les rythmes digitales and zoot woman .
the fact that madonna is releasing a second continuous dj mix version of confessions on a dancefloor will also appeal to dance music fans , mr loben says .
" clubbers are generally open to any music as long as it sounds good on the dancefloor . "
some of our readers say she should grow old a bit more gracefully ian eddy , smash hits while clubbers are relatively unconcerned by the age of an artist , madonna has been permanently ousted from the cover of smash hits magazine by acts such as teen stars mcfly and son of dork .
staff writer ian eddy says teenage music fans judge madonna on a song-by-song basis .
" pop fans are a bit fickle , " he says .
" if her next single is a bit of a dud they wo n't bother with it . "
smash hits readers were divided in their opinion of madonna 's promo video for her single hung up , in which the 47-year-old contorts herself in a pink leotard and flirts with young dancers .
" a lot of our readers are saying madonna has still got it , that she is still youthful , " says mr eddy , " but some say she should grow old a bit more gracefully . "
young pop stars may cite madonna as a music or fashion influence , but teenage music fans " just do n't have the same affection for her as people in their 30s do " .
madonna 's gay audience has always been very forgiving , perhaps too forgiving matt miles , axm magazine madonna 's most loyal fan group has been gay men , which gay magazine axm attributes to her eye for fashion and music trends , and her ever-changing image .
" many gay people want to break away from their past , and every six months madonna goes into a cocoon then emerges as a new butterfly , " says axm editor matt miles .
she strengthened her gay and lesbian fanbase by challenging sexual and religious convention in promo videos such as like a prayer and justify my love , suggestive live performances and 1992 's explicit sex photo book .
" madonna 's gay audience has always been very forgiving , perhaps too forgiving , " says mr miles .
" it would take an awful lot to put gay men off her . "
mr miles says it is understandable why madonna would want to " throw herself back into the gay bosom " with a new hi-energy album , after the relative failure of american life .
" why not ?
it does n't seem too cynical , and it worked for kylie minogue .
it is as if madonna is sampling the 1980s but making it better . "
when not making dance records , madonna is a children 's author gay fans believe madonna 's career will match the longevity of that other iconic us singer , cher .
if her songs match her ambition , she may also retain her revived mainstream audience .
mr eddy says : " madonna really thinks of herself as young .
i ca n't see her sticking to dance music but she could easily come back in a few years with something fresh . "
" madonna may return to the slower beats of her ray of light album or move into torch songs , " adds mr miles .
" she would probably like to turn herself into a cartoon , and is kicking herself that gorillaz got there first . "
he concludes : " she is pushing 50 and still looks great .
i would n't put it past her to be swinging off a trapeze at the age of 60 . "

the bbc news website 's entertainment section wants to reflect the concerns and interests of the most important people in the entertainment industry - you .
we want to find out what you consider to be the biggest issues and hottest topics across the arts , music , film , tv and radio .
you may have a gripe about ticket prices , arts funding or downloading , or you may have discovered a fantastic new scene , initiative or innovation that you and your friends love - but nobody else knows about .
we will publish the best ideas and invite other readers to share their views and experiences .
we want your messages to generate discussion and , with a bit of luck , issues and themes will emerge .
the bbc news website 's entertainment reporter ian youngs will follow up the most interesting with full-blown stories and features on the site .
we are also looking for bona fide news stories that you think warrant investigation or exposure - so let us know what 's on your mind .
due to technical difficulties , messages sent before 1530 gmt on sunday 6 november were not received .
i have two gripes , both about dvds .
firstly i bought two new films on dvd recently - kung fu hustle & ong bak .
they are both good films , with great fighting scenes .
as they are chinese and thai , they have dubbed english audio .
kung fu hustle 's english audio is good , it sounds like chinese people that can speak english , which gives a more authentic feel to the film but ong bak 's english audio sounds like the cast of eastenders or emmerdale talking , it 's quite off putting .
for the amount of money films make , a little extra effort would not really make a dent in the profits .
my second moan is dvd prices - i was recently at stansted airport , where there is a sign outside the hmv store that says ' tax free prices for everyone ' .
i went in to see if i could pick up any bargains , i was shocked as the prices i was seeing were more expensive than prices i had seen in an hmv store in peterborough two days earlier .
how is this possible ?
is there some kind of airport tax added before the tax free offer is applied ?
surely they know people will notice .
paul stewart , chaunay , france regional restrictions on dvds make me very angry too !
i live in the usa but i love cinema from all over the world .
i find it very frustrating that i ca n't buy a dvd of , say , an australian movie or a british movie online , and guarantee i can play it here .
why ca n't dvds be like cds ?
not all of us are pirating these things - we just want to be able to see a wide range of world cinema at home , especially movies which may not even have been released in theatres here in the usa .
isabelle , brit in usa podcasts .
more people should know and listen to these radio talks shows , they are awesome !
matt , spokane u.s.a. i think the greatest problem with the entertainment industry as a whole is twofold .
one is the rampant growth of copyright violation , both in terms of laws lengthening the years a work stays under copyright and astounding ways companies try to protect their " intellectual properties . "
this is an industry that believes its customers are pirates who engage in " copyright theft " first and honest users second .
fair use rights have been thrown to the roadside for the benefit of business to increase profit margins .
it 's a telling soundbite when the head of sony says that " most people do n't know what a rootkit is , so why are they worried about it ? "
as the moral goes , " the more you squeeze your fingers , the more will slip through your grasp . "
kevin mason , tucson , arizona , usa having serious societal issues depicted in films -lrb- that might be released 2 or 3 time a year let 's say -rrb- is one thing however when the same issues -lrb- sexual / physical abuse for example -rrb- are turned into tv programs that air nightly in family homes and are called ' entertainment ' i am concerned about the long term effect on our communities subsequent perception of their own everyday world .
i wonder how we can on one hand react so vehemently to such emotional issues on our doorstep and yet have it turned into profit making ' entertainment ' without so much as a whimper ?
peter mackay , sydney australia -lrb- born in liverpool uk -rrb- booking fees on top of already expensive ticket prices - i booked four shows -lrb- two tickets for each show -rrb- and got charged a fee for each ticket on top of the ticket price .
also - why do n't they make it illegal to sell any ticket for more than its face value ?
surely that would stop touts and other crooks from thriving .
mick h , swindon wilts while i can see the many benefits of digital broadcasting , what does concern me is that not all viewers / listeners are equal .
where i live , i can not use a digital top set box or use a dab radio .
i 'm therefore forced to use rupert murdoch 's sky dish .
unfortunately many new channels that are available on freeview i can not receive unless i take out a full subscription with sky .
unless there is a commitment to an equity in public broadcasting delivery the technology is going alienate many people .
stuart barker , derbyshire , uk i 'm glad that grokster has closed , mainly because it will be interesting to see who the music people blame for loss of earnings if all the p2p programs closed down .
i 'm also mad about ticket touts .
it should be illegal to ticket tout , especially after the live 8 incident where callous people were selling live 8 tickets on ebay for massive profits in order to line their own pockets .
carl robertson , swindon , uk i object to laws being written at the behest of the entertainment industry which prevent me from performing legal actions .
i have the legal right to copy a dvd from the disk to another format yet the dmca and similar laws prevent me from doing this as to do so i would have to break the encryption on the disk .
this also prevents me from producing compilation clip disks to use in graduate film studies classes .
switching disks and finding points in films can cost up to 10 minutes per lecture , especially when disks prevent you from skipping the logos , trailers and copyright messages at the start .
richard feilden , santa barbara , usa copyright protection is becoming a joke with large companies having far too much influence on particularly american laws , which europe often rolls over for at some later point .
since piracy became prevalent -lrb- which i do not approve of -rrb- we have reasonably priced dvd 's and cd 's , improved speed of release , and simultaneous availability to stop the consumer being fleeced every which way possible .
i do not approve of piracy , but i applaud the results that piracy has had in putting these companies in their place , and i utterly resent their increasingly illegal attempts to squash us back down .
richard munro , uk you know what really grinds my gears bbc ?
dvd regions and the prospect of the new generation of blu ray having similar technology .
what is the point of regional coding ?
we supposedly live in a global capitalist market and yet there is a restriction on the international flow of information .
what i do n't understand is why people thought that it would be a good idea .
the most unpleasant thing it could is increase price competition for dvds .
this should be made illegal .
ross pearson , london , uk / athens , usa region restrictions on dvd players .
i legally purchase dvds from us and uk .
my computer dvd restricts the region -lrb- after 5 switches -rrb- what in reality are they trying to protect ?
i have bought a laptop to travel with .
it 's stupid that i am restricted on playing dvd from the countries i visit .
roo , usa the day dawneth when the tv and home computer become one .
i find the reception in my area bad , and no matter what i do ca n't find a good signal - hence i do n't watch much tv .
i am looking forward to using the new broadband tv service from the bbc when they roll it out next year .
for me this will enable me to watch my favourite programs , and like radio online i can watch it in my time .
we are living on the crest of the digital revolution , and our children will look back in school and wonder where it all happened .
we are living history , and through our computers we are shaping our world .
rachel saunders , preston , uk whatever happened to our national sense of pride in our theatres ?
in the first half of the 20th century , we had such luminaries as george bernard shaw , noel coward and laurence olivier , quite rightly regarded as legends in their own time because of their sheer ability to hold their own slightly skewed mirrors up to life .
in shakespeare 's time , people would cram into the stalls of the globe and others like it , just to see what new spectacle of emotion and fantasy would be brought alive before their very eyes .
today , we have , at the height of our cultural mountain ... yet another half-hearted , mangled production of a.n.other american playwright 's ' classic ' , naturally featuring a cast which consists primarily of hollywood ' here today , gone tomorrow ' tabloid darlings determined to ' tick off the stage ' before their 15 minutes is up .
meanwhile , that which is going on in the fringe venues of our capital city goes largely ignored by critics , in spite of the fact that it is often of far better all-round quality than the technical jiggery of the west end musicals .
krystina nellis , london , uk surely it is now time to move eastenders from its current slot to one that is beyond the watershed .
if this were a movie it would be deemed to be pg , particularly given the escalation in violence .
it does not make pleasant family viewing and is certainly not providing suitable storylines for those without adult supervision .
constant fisticuffs , gun toting gangsters and scenes of threatening behaviour towards females is not something the bbc should expose children to .
glenn , london , uk despite what the cinema adverts claim , copying a dvd is not stealing ...
it 's copyright infringement .
it is perfectly possible to download material you would not consider a high-enough priority to buy , even if downloading were not an option .
providing you leech and do not redistribute the material , doing so neither robs the author of the original content , nor of any revenue .
the corporations can get away with such falsehoods as to speak out as a consumer is to admit liability of copyright infringement !
anon , uk i buy both cds and vinyl records ; i buy a lot of vinyl records .
in order to mix up my music from two different sources i use mini disc component players hooked up to my amplifier .
i ca n't use i-pods or similar devices because i have no way of recording my music onto them using the amplifier / stereo .
i need to record all of my music , one time , onto one large database of some sort .
i love digital technology but have no intention to stop buying vinyl records so i really need a device which plugs into my amplifier so that i can record from both sources and store all my music in one place .
mike staley , hong kong i was so delighted to find that the fabulous eric clapton is touring again next year and returning to the royal albert hall in may .
i was stunned when i found that an arena ticket was going to cost me £ 60 plus a booking fee ! !
i am a huge fan and as such i 've paid the money as i want to see him play live , but , how can promoters and concert venues justify this kind of ticket price and what is the booking fee for ?
administration of the booking ?
is n't that what they 're paid to do ?
surely we spend enough as it is on albums and singles without having to stump up such high prices to see a live performance .
what do the artists think about this situation ?
gary bowyer , sutton , surrey what really annoys me about the fall of p2p networks is the fact that you may wish for your music to be heard by a wide audience - if like me you are in an unsigned band .
this medium can be ideal if you want to get your music out there .
i really despise the companies and artists who are totally against p2p .
in my opinion people should make music for the love of it and not expect automatically money in return , they should be honoured that people actually want to listen to their work .
anthony lloyd , warrington , england as a book publisher i 'm certain that big changes are around the corner for readers .
those changes will be led by fashion and the younger generation : give them an ipod-style ebook reader that is cool to carry , and they will realise the advantage at school and college of carrying one ' book ' around with them instead of dozens .
that one gadget can contain thousands of books - imagine taking one ' book ' on holiday containing everything you want to read instead of a heavy pile of novels .
if it takes off like the ipod there will be a craze for downloading ebooks .
the only snag is that the majority of books currently in print are not yet converted to ebooks and it will take a few years for the industry to catch up .
my company has converted to ebook formats 200 of its titles so far , but we have a long way to go .
stewart ferris , chichester , uk i am deaf and have been denied access to the professional theatre for 50-odd years apart from my learning lines and appearing in various amateur productions .
now we have stagetext who caption what is being said or sung by the actors / performers and even effects are written in as well -lrb- eg crash , bang , wallop ! -rrb-
stagetext was born in 2000 and now gives deaf people 100 % access to the theatre where they are actively involved .
but only a few productions are captioned and it is still an exercise in military planning to know which performance , where and at what time to go to in order to see / read these rare but treasured captioned shows .
michael theobald , london my family rented out ' valiant ' last night on dvd , and i noticed that the trailers at the start could not be skipped !
this also seems to be standard in disney titles on dvd , and i find it very frustrating not being able to control what i am watching on this medium .
steve , uk how can the download industry justify charging the same price for albums as buying the cd ?
the quality and lack of artwork and box plus all the associated packaging costs should bring the price down for mp3 quite considerably .
i do not buy any downloads because of this blatant rip-off .
david harpin , st albans , uk today i read about the grokster p2p service being forced to declare itself illegal .
what the entertainment industry fails to realise is that people use p2p to download copyrighted material because there is no " legal " way of doing so .
the success of itunes proves that once such a " legal " way is provided , take-up will be massive .
the tv and movie industries need to bring out their own versions of such systems in order to cut piracy .
jack , uk a big bugbear of mine are the extra ' fees ' for buying tickets for gigs or theatre .
there is an extortionate ' booking fee ' -lrb- especially when you buy online , and do all the work -rrb- , postage fees etc .
one time i bought a ticket of £ 8 face value , yet my credit card was charged approx £ 14 .
dave m , bedington , surrey , uk television advertising is not being viewed since the introduction of tivo and sky + , website advertising is n't being viewed , simply over-looked -lrb- we are more interested in the articles , not the flashy banners -rrb- and radio advertising just do n't exert themselves as much as they could !
the advertising and product placement industry is changing for the better , and with dynamic directions such as product placement in songs or even advertising within computer-games markets , we are able to adapt and work on having subliminal advertising .
this is something the world has always been appalled at , but i personally do n't think that this is anything to worry about .
mark hendrikx , london & berlin microsoft allow licence buyers to install there office software on both one desktop pc and one laptop , this is on the understanding that if the user is using the laptop they wo n't be using the desktop and vice versa .
perhaps the music industry should be looking at this also .
martin sherrit , aberdeen , scotland my main gripe is fair use of music that i have legally bought .
i 'm more than happy to pay out for new cds , but begrudge being told how i can use those cds for personal listening .
i think a policy of ' fair use ' needs to be adopted from the perspective of being able to rip cds that one has bought in order to play the music on another medium - such as an ipod .
i 'm hardly going to listen to the latest eric clapton album on cd and ipod at the same time !
there also needs to be more pressure placed on the music companies for supplying and selling cds that do not conform to the red book audio standard - ie they contain some form of copyright protection .
therefore , they should not carry the compact disc digital audio logo and also should not be marketed as audio cds , instead as cd-roms that carry audio tracks .
neil sherin , portsmouth , uk i am an unpublished novelist looking to the future of the publishing industry and staking my career on what i think is coming our way .
with the music industry reeling from the continuous onslaught from technology stripping away their business models , not much is said about the coming storm in the publishing world .
the only reason that publishing appears to be immune from the phenomenon -lrb- mass-migration to downloadable books -rrb- is that most people hate reading for extended periods on screen .
while many will be tired of the old mantra that we will all be reading electronic books in the near future ; this time it really is imminent .
sony , with its ill-conceived librie , demonstrates that the technology is here now .
if a far-sighted company followed apple 's example -lrb- ipod -rrb- to produce a device for readers using paper-like screens and -lrb- like apple -rrb- focused on selling the device instead of shoring up old business models , the resulting change in the publishing landscape would make that in the music industry seem glacial .
right out of the gate , there are thousands of classics available free from the gutenberg project - a great temptation to migrate to a well executed , paper-like device for all but the most bookish luddites on the planet .
in february i started the world 's first podcast-only novel and the first written straight to podcast .
my plan is to use this medium to grow an audience while keeping control of my work .
although produced directly to audiobook , tom corven is a traditional novel and its ultimate destination is in print .
i finished the tale last sunday and cast it to a small but respectable listener-base of approximately 2,500 people .
paul story , glasgow , scotland i do n't think british actors are paid the same amount as american " celebrities " and find this unfair .
british actors are far more talented and versatile than most of their american counterparts .

i have two gripes , both about dvds .
firstly i bought two new films on dvd recently - kung fu hustle & ong bak .
they are both good films , with great fighting scenes .
as they are chinese and thai , they have dubbed english audio .
kung fu hustle 's english audio is good , it sounds like chinese people that can speak english , which gives a more authentic feel to the film but ong bak 's english audio sounds like the cast of eastenders or emmerdale talking , it 's quite off putting .
for the amount of money films make , a little extra effort would not really make a dent in the profits .
my second moan is dvd prices - i was recently at stansted airport , where there is a sign outside the hmv store that says ' tax free prices for everyone ' .
i went in to see if i could pick up any bargains , i was shocked as the prices i was seeing were more expensive than prices i had seen in an hmv store in peterborough two days earlier .
how is this possible ?
is there some kind of airport tax added before the tax free offer is applied ?
surely they know people will notice .
paul stewart , chaunay , france regional restrictions on dvds make me very angry too !
i live in the usa but i love cinema from all over the world .
i find it very frustrating that i ca n't buy a dvd of , say , an australian movie or a british movie online , and guarantee i can play it here .
why ca n't dvds be like cds ?
not all of us are pirating these things - we just want to be able to see a wide range of world cinema at home , especially movies which may not even have been released in theatres here in the usa .
isabelle , brit in usa podcasts .
more people should know and listen to these radio talks shows , they are awesome !
matt , spokane u.s.a. i think the greatest problem with the entertainment industry as a whole is twofold .
one is the rampant growth of copyright violation , both in terms of laws lengthening the years a work stays under copyright and astounding ways companies try to protect their " intellectual properties . "
this is an industry that believes its customers are pirates who engage in " copyright theft " first and honest users second .
fair use rights have been thrown to the roadside for the benefit of business to increase profit margins .
it 's a telling soundbite when the head of sony says that " most people do n't know what a rootkit is , so why are they worried about it ? "
as the moral goes , " the more you squeeze your fingers , the more will slip through your grasp . "
kevin mason , tucson , arizona , usa having serious societal issues depicted in films -lrb- that might be released 2 or 3 time a year let 's say -rrb- is one thing however when the same issues -lrb- sexual / physical abuse for example -rrb- are turned into tv programs that air nightly in family homes and are called ' entertainment ' i am concerned about the long term effect on our communities subsequent perception of their own everyday world .
i wonder how we can on one hand react so vehemently to such emotional issues on our doorstep and yet have it turned into profit making ' entertainment ' without so much as a whimper ?
peter mackay , sydney australia -lrb- born in liverpool uk -rrb- booking fees on top of already expensive ticket prices - i booked four shows -lrb- two tickets for each show -rrb- and got charged a fee for each ticket on top of the ticket price .
also - why do n't they make it illegal to sell any ticket for more than its face value ?
surely that would stop touts and other crooks from thriving .
mick h , swindon wilts while i can see the many benefits of digital broadcasting , what does concern me is that not all viewers / listeners are equal .
where i live , i can not use a digital top set box or use a dab radio .
i 'm therefore forced to use rupert murdoch 's sky dish .
unfortunately many new channels that are available on freeview i can not receive unless i take out a full subscription with sky .
unless there is a commitment to an equity in public broadcasting delivery the technology is going alienate many people .
stuart barker , derbyshire , uk i 'm glad that grokster has closed , mainly because it will be interesting to see who the music people blame for loss of earnings if all the p2p programs closed down .
i 'm also mad about ticket touts .
it should be illegal to ticket tout , especially after the live 8 incident where callous people were selling live 8 tickets on ebay for massive profits in order to line their own pockets .
carl robertson , swindon , uk i object to laws being written at the behest of the entertainment industry which prevent me from performing legal actions .
i have the legal right to copy a dvd from the disk to another format yet the dmca and similar laws prevent me from doing this as to do so i would have to break the encryption on the disk .
this also prevents me from producing compilation clip disks to use in graduate film studies classes .
switching disks and finding points in films can cost up to 10 minutes per lecture , especially when disks prevent you from skipping the logos , trailers and copyright messages at the start .
richard feilden , santa barbara , usa copyright protection is becoming a joke with large companies having far too much influence on particularly american laws , which europe often rolls over for at some later point .

due to technical difficulties , messages sent before 1530 gmt on sunday 6 november were not received .
i have two gripes , both about dvds .
firstly i bought two new films on dvd recently - kung fu hustle & ong bak .
they are both good films , with great fighting scenes .
as they are chinese and thai , they have dubbed english audio .
kung fu hustle 's english audio is good , it sounds like chinese people that can speak english , which gives a more authentic feel to the film but ong bak 's english audio sounds like the cast of eastenders or emmerdale talking , it 's quite off putting .
for the amount of money films make , a little extra effort would not really make a dent in the profits .
my second moan is dvd prices - i was recently at stansted airport , where there is a sign outside the hmv store that says ' tax free prices for everyone ' .
i went in to see if i could pick up any bargains , i was shocked as the prices i was seeing were more expensive than prices i had seen in an hmv store in peterborough two days earlier .
how is this possible ?
is there some kind of airport tax added before the tax free offer is applied ?
surely they know people will notice .
paul stewart , chaunay , france regional restrictions on dvds make me very angry too !
i live in the usa but i love cinema from all over the world .
i find it very frustrating that i ca n't buy a dvd of , say , an australian movie or a british movie online , and guarantee i can play it here .
why ca n't dvds be like cds ?
not all of us are pirating these things - we just want to be able to see a wide range of world cinema at home , especially movies which may not even have been released in theatres here in the usa .
isabelle , brit in usa podcasts .
more people should know and listen to these radio talks shows , they are awesome !
matt , spokane u.s.a. i think the greatest problem with the entertainment industry as a whole is twofold .
one is the rampant growth of copyright violation , both in terms of laws lengthening the years a work stays under copyright and astounding ways companies try to protect their " intellectual properties . "
this is an industry that believes its customers are pirates who engage in " copyright theft " first and honest users second .
fair use rights have been thrown to the roadside for the benefit of business to increase profit margins .
it 's a telling soundbite when the head of sony says that " most people do n't know what a rootkit is , so why are they worried about it ? "
as the moral goes , " the more you squeeze your fingers , the more will slip through your grasp . "
kevin mason , tucson , arizona , usa having serious societal issues depicted in films -lrb- that might be released 2 or 3 time a year let 's say -rrb- is one thing however when the same issues -lrb- sexual / physical abuse for example -rrb- are turned into tv programs that air nightly in family homes and are called ' entertainment ' i am concerned about the long term effect on our communities subsequent perception of their own everyday world .
i wonder how we can on one hand react so vehemently to such emotional issues on our doorstep and yet have it turned into profit making ' entertainment ' without so much as a whimper ?
peter mackay , sydney australia -lrb- born in liverpool uk -rrb- booking fees on top of already expensive ticket prices - i booked four shows -lrb- two tickets for each show -rrb- and got charged a fee for each ticket on top of the ticket price .
also - why do n't they make it illegal to sell any ticket for more than its face value ?
surely that would stop touts and other crooks from thriving .
mick h , swindon wilts while i can see the many benefits of digital broadcasting , what does concern me is that not all viewers / listeners are equal .
where i live , i can not use a digital top set box or use a dab radio .
i 'm therefore forced to use rupert murdoch 's sky dish .
unfortunately many new channels that are available on freeview i can not receive unless i take out a full subscription with sky .
unless there is a commitment to an equity in public broadcasting delivery the technology is going alienate many people .
stuart barker , derbyshire , uk i 'm glad that grokster has closed , mainly because it will be interesting to see who the music people blame for loss of earnings if all the p2p programs closed down .
i 'm also mad about ticket touts .
it should be illegal to ticket tout , especially after the live 8 incident where callous people were selling live 8 tickets on ebay for massive profits in order to line their own pockets .
carl robertson , swindon , uk i object to laws being written at the behest of the entertainment industry which prevent me from performing legal actions .
i have the legal right to copy a dvd from the disk to another format yet the dmca and similar laws prevent me from doing this as to do so i would have to break the encryption on the disk .
this also prevents me from producing compilation clip disks to use in graduate film studies classes .
switching disks and finding points in films can cost up to 10 minutes per lecture , especially when disks prevent you from skipping the logos , trailers and copyright messages at the start .
richard feilden , santa barbara , usa copyright protection is becoming a joke with large companies having far too much influence on particularly american laws , which europe often rolls over for at some later point .
since piracy became prevalent -lrb- which i do not approve of -rrb- we have reasonably priced dvd 's and cd 's , improved speed of release , and simultaneous availability to stop the consumer being fleeced every which way possible .
i do not approve of piracy , but i applaud the results that piracy has had in putting these companies in their place , and i utterly resent their increasingly illegal attempts to squash us back down .
richard munro , uk you know what really grinds my gears bbc ?
dvd regions and the prospect of the new generation of blu ray having similar technology .
what is the point of regional coding ?
we supposedly live in a global capitalist market and yet there is a restriction on the international flow of information .
what i do n't understand is why people thought that it would be a good idea .
the most unpleasant thing it could is increase price competition for dvds .
this should be made illegal .
ross pearson , london , uk / athens , usa region restrictions on dvd players .
i legally purchase dvds from us and uk .
my computer dvd restricts the region -lrb- after 5 switches -rrb- what in reality are they trying to protect ?
i have bought a laptop to travel with .
it 's stupid that i am restricted on playing dvd from the countries i visit .
roo , usa the day dawneth when the tv and home computer become one .
i find the reception in my area bad , and no matter what i do ca n't find a good signal - hence i do n't watch much tv .
i am looking forward to using the new broadband tv service from the bbc when they roll it out next year .
for me this will enable me to watch my favourite programs , and like radio online i can watch it in my time .
we are living on the crest of the digital revolution , and our children will look back in school and wonder where it all happened .
we are living history , and through our computers we are shaping our world .
rachel saunders , preston , uk whatever happened to our national sense of pride in our theatres ?
in the first half of the 20th century , we had such luminaries as george bernard shaw , noel coward and laurence olivier , quite rightly regarded as legends in their own time because of their sheer ability to hold their own slightly skewed mirrors up to life .
in shakespeare 's time , people would cram into the stalls of the globe and others like it , just to see what new spectacle of emotion and fantasy would be brought alive before their very eyes .
today , we have , at the height of our cultural mountain ... yet another half-hearted , mangled production of a.n.other american playwright 's ' classic ' , naturally featuring a cast which consists primarily of hollywood ' here today , gone tomorrow ' tabloid darlings determined to ' tick off the stage ' before their 15 minutes is up .
meanwhile , that which is going on in the fringe venues of our capital city goes largely ignored by critics , in spite of the fact that it is often of far better all-round quality than the technical jiggery of the west end musicals .
krystina nellis , london , uk surely it is now time to move eastenders from its current slot to one that is beyond the watershed .
if this were a movie it would be deemed to be pg , particularly given the escalation in violence .
it does not make pleasant family viewing and is certainly not providing suitable storylines for those without adult supervision .
constant fisticuffs , gun toting gangsters and scenes of threatening behaviour towards females is not something the bbc should expose children to .
glenn , london , uk despite what the cinema adverts claim , copying a dvd is not stealing ...
it 's copyright infringement .
it is perfectly possible to download material you would not consider a high-enough priority to buy , even if downloading were not an option .
providing you leech and do not redistribute the material , doing so neither robs the author of the original content , nor of any revenue .
the corporations can get away with such falsehoods as to speak out as a consumer is to admit liability of copyright infringement !
anon , uk i buy both cds and vinyl records ; i buy a lot of vinyl records .
in order to mix up my music from two different sources i use mini disc component players hooked up to my amplifier .
i ca n't use i-pods or similar devices because i have no way of recording my music onto them using the amplifier / stereo .
i need to record all of my music , one time , onto one large database of some sort .
i love digital technology but have no intention to stop buying vinyl records so i really need a device which plugs into my amplifier so that i can record from both sources and store all my music in one place .
mike staley , hong kong i was so delighted to find that the fabulous eric clapton is touring again next year and returning to the royal albert hall in may .
i was stunned when i found that an arena ticket was going to cost me £ 60 plus a booking fee ! !
i am a huge fan and as such i 've paid the money as i want to see him play live , but , how can promoters and concert venues justify this kind of ticket price and what is the booking fee for ?
administration of the booking ?
is n't that what they 're paid to do ?
surely we spend enough as it is on albums and singles without having to stump up such high prices to see a live performance .
what do the artists think about this situation ?
gary bowyer , sutton , surrey what really annoys me about the fall of p2p networks is the fact that you may wish for your music to be heard by a wide audience - if like me you are in an unsigned band .
this medium can be ideal if you want to get your music out there .
i really despise the companies and artists who are totally against p2p .
in my opinion people should make music for the love of it and not expect automatically money in return , they should be honoured that people actually want to listen to their work .
anthony lloyd , warrington , england as a book publisher i 'm certain that big changes are around the corner for readers .
those changes will be led by fashion and the younger generation : give them an ipod-style ebook reader that is cool to carry , and they will realise the advantage at school and college of carrying one ' book ' around with them instead of dozens .
that one gadget can contain thousands of books - imagine taking one ' book ' on holiday containing everything you want to read instead of a heavy pile of novels .
if it takes off like the ipod there will be a craze for downloading ebooks .
the only snag is that the majority of books currently in print are not yet converted to ebooks and it will take a few years for the industry to catch up .
my company has converted to ebook formats 200 of its titles so far , but we have a long way to go .
stewart ferris , chichester , uk i am deaf and have been denied access to the professional theatre for 50-odd years apart from my learning lines and appearing in various amateur productions .
now we have stagetext who caption what is being said or sung by the actors / performers and even effects are written in as well -lrb- eg crash , bang , wallop ! -rrb-
stagetext was born in 2000 and now gives deaf people 100 % access to the theatre where they are actively involved .
but only a few productions are captioned and it is still an exercise in military planning to know which performance , where and at what time to go to in order to see / read these rare but treasured captioned shows .
michael theobald , london my family rented out ' valiant ' last night on dvd , and i noticed that the trailers at the start could not be skipped !
this also seems to be standard in disney titles on dvd , and i find it very frustrating not being able to control what i am watching on this medium .
steve , uk how can the download industry justify charging the same price for albums as buying the cd ?
the quality and lack of artwork and box plus all the associated packaging costs should bring the price down for mp3 quite considerably .
i do not buy any downloads because of this blatant rip-off .
david harpin , st albans , uk today i read about the grokster p2p service being forced to declare itself illegal .
what the entertainment industry fails to realise is that people use p2p to download copyrighted material because there is no " legal " way of doing so .
the success of itunes proves that once such a " legal " way is provided , take-up will be massive .
the tv and movie industries need to bring out their own versions of such systems in order to cut piracy .
jack , uk a big bugbear of mine are the extra ' fees ' for buying tickets for gigs or theatre .
there is an extortionate ' booking fee ' -lrb- especially when you buy online , and do all the work -rrb- , postage fees etc .
one time i bought a ticket of £ 8 face value , yet my credit card was charged approx £ 14 .
dave m , bedington , surrey , uk television advertising is not being viewed since the introduction of tivo and sky + , website advertising is n't being viewed , simply over-looked -lrb- we are more interested in the articles , not the flashy banners -rrb- and radio advertising just do n't exert themselves as much as they could !
the advertising and product placement industry is changing for the better , and with dynamic directions such as product placement in songs or even advertising within computer-games markets , we are able to adapt and work on having subliminal advertising .
this is something the world has always been appalled at , but i personally do n't think that this is anything to worry about .
mark hendrikx , london & berlin microsoft allow licence buyers to install there office software on both one desktop pc and one laptop , this is on the understanding that if the user is using the laptop they wo n't be using the desktop and vice versa .
perhaps the music industry should be looking at this also .
martin sherrit , aberdeen , scotland my main gripe is fair use of music that i have legally bought .
i 'm more than happy to pay out for new cds , but begrudge being told how i can use those cds for personal listening .
i think a policy of ' fair use ' needs to be adopted from the perspective of being able to rip cds that one has bought in order to play the music on another medium - such as an ipod .
i 'm hardly going to listen to the latest eric clapton album on cd and ipod at the same time !
there also needs to be more pressure placed on the music companies for supplying and selling cds that do not conform to the red book audio standard - ie they contain some form of copyright protection .
therefore , they should not carry the compact disc digital audio logo and also should not be marketed as audio cds , instead as cd-roms that carry audio tracks .
neil sherin , portsmouth , uk i am an unpublished novelist looking to the future of the publishing industry and staking my career on what i think is coming our way .
with the music industry reeling from the continuous onslaught from technology stripping away their business models , not much is said about the coming storm in the publishing world .
the only reason that publishing appears to be immune from the phenomenon -lrb- mass-migration to downloadable books -rrb- is that most people hate reading for extended periods on screen .
while many will be tired of the old mantra that we will all be reading electronic books in the near future ; this time it really is imminent .
sony , with its ill-conceived librie , demonstrates that the technology is here now .
if a far-sighted company followed apple 's example -lrb- ipod -rrb- to produce a device for readers using paper-like screens and -lrb- like apple -rrb- focused on selling the device instead of shoring up old business models , the resulting change in the publishing landscape would make that in the music industry seem glacial .
right out of the gate , there are thousands of classics available free from the gutenberg project - a great temptation to migrate to a well executed , paper-like device for all but the most bookish luddites on the planet .
in february i started the world 's first podcast-only novel and the first written straight to podcast .
my plan is to use this medium to grow an audience while keeping control of my work .
although produced directly to audiobook , tom corven is a traditional novel and its ultimate destination is in print .
i finished the tale last sunday and cast it to a small but respectable listener-base of approximately 2,500 people .
paul story , glasgow , scotland i do n't think british actors are paid the same amount as american " celebrities " and find this unfair .
british actors are far more talented and versatile than most of their american counterparts .

michael theobald , london my family rented out ' valiant ' last night on dvd , and i noticed that the trailers at the start could not be skipped !
this also seems to be standard in disney titles on dvd , and i find it very frustrating not being able to control what i am watching on this medium .
steve , uk how can the download industry justify charging the same price for albums as buying the cd ?
the quality and lack of artwork and box plus all the associated packaging costs should bring the price down for mp3 quite considerably .
i do not buy any downloads because of this blatant rip-off .
david harpin , st albans , uk today i read about the grokster p2p service being forced to declare itself illegal .
what the entertainment industry fails to realise is that people use p2p to download copyrighted material because there is no " legal " way of doing so .
the success of itunes proves that once such a " legal " way is provided , take-up will be massive .
the tv and movie industries need to bring out their own versions of such systems in order to cut piracy .
jack , uk a big bugbear of mine are the extra ' fees ' for buying tickets for gigs or theatre .
there is an extortionate ' booking fee ' -lrb- especially when you buy online , and do all the work -rrb- , postage fees etc .
one time i bought a ticket of £ 8 face value , yet my credit card was charged approx £ 14 .
dave m , bedington , surrey , uk television advertising is not being viewed since the introduction of tivo and sky + , website advertising is n't being viewed , simply over-looked -lrb- we are more interested in the articles , not the flashy banners -rrb- and radio advertising just do n't exert themselves as much as they could !
the advertising and product placement industry is changing for the better , and with dynamic directions such as product placement in songs or even advertising within computer-games markets , we are able to adapt and work on having subliminal advertising .
this is something the world has always been appalled at , but i personally do n't think that this is anything to worry about .
mark hendrikx , london & berlin microsoft allow licence buyers to install there office software on both one desktop pc and one laptop , this is on the understanding that if the user is using the laptop they wo n't be using the desktop and vice versa .
perhaps the music industry should be looking at this also .
martin sherrit , aberdeen , scotland my main gripe is fair use of music that i have legally bought .
i 'm more than happy to pay out for new cds , but begrudge being told how i can use those cds for personal listening .
i think a policy of ' fair use ' needs to be adopted from the perspective of being able to rip cds that one has bought in order to play the music on another medium - such as an ipod .
i 'm hardly going to listen to the latest eric clapton album on cd and ipod at the same time !
there also needs to be more pressure placed on the music companies for supplying and selling cds that do not conform to the red book audio standard - ie they contain some form of copyright protection .
therefore , they should not carry the compact disc digital audio logo and also should not be marketed as audio cds , instead as cd-roms that carry audio tracks .
neil sherin , portsmouth , uk i am an unpublished novelist looking to the future of the publishing industry and staking my career on what i think is coming our way .
with the music industry reeling from the continuous onslaught from technology stripping away their business models , not much is said about the coming storm in the publishing world .
the only reason that publishing appears to be immune from the phenomenon -lrb- mass-migration to downloadable books -rrb- is that most people hate reading for extended periods on screen .
while many will be tired of the old mantra that we will all be reading electronic books in the near future ; this time it really is imminent .
sony , with its ill-conceived librie , demonstrates that the technology is here now .
if a far-sighted company followed apple 's example -lrb- ipod -rrb- to produce a device for readers using paper-like screens and -lrb- like apple -rrb- focused on selling the device instead of shoring up old business models , the resulting change in the publishing landscape would make that in the music industry seem glacial .
right out of the gate , there are thousands of classics available free from the gutenberg project - a great temptation to migrate to a well executed , paper-like device for all but the most bookish luddites on the planet .
in february i started the world 's first podcast-only novel and the first written straight to podcast .
my plan is to use this medium to grow an audience while keeping control of my work .
although produced directly to audiobook , tom corven is a traditional novel and its ultimate destination is in print .
i finished the tale last sunday and cast it to a small but respectable listener-base of approximately 2,500 people .
paul story , glasgow , scotland i do n't think british actors are paid the same amount as american " celebrities " and find this unfair .
british actors are far more talented and versatile than most of their american counterparts .

i have two gripes , both about dvds .
firstly i bought two new films on dvd recently - kung fu hustle & ong bak .
they are both good films , with great fighting scenes .
as they are chinese and thai , they have dubbed english audio .
kung fu hustle 's english audio is good , it sounds like chinese people that can speak english , which gives a more authentic feel to the film but ong bak 's english audio sounds like the cast of eastenders or emmerdale talking , it 's quite off putting .
for the amount of money films make , a little extra effort would not really make a dent in the profits .
my second moan is dvd prices - i was recently at stansted airport , where there is a sign outside the hmv store that says ' tax free prices for everyone ' .
i went in to see if i could pick up any bargains , i was shocked as the prices i was seeing were more expensive than prices i had seen in an hmv store in peterborough two days earlier .
how is this possible ?
is there some kind of airport tax added before the tax free offer is applied ?
surely they know people will notice .
paul stewart , chaunay , france regional restrictions on dvds make me very angry too !
i live in the usa but i love cinema from all over the world .
i find it very frustrating that i ca n't buy a dvd of , say , an australian movie or a british movie online , and guarantee i can play it here .
why ca n't dvds be like cds ?
not all of us are pirating these things - we just want to be able to see a wide range of world cinema at home , especially movies which may not even have been released in theatres here in the usa .
isabelle , brit in usa podcasts .
more people should know and listen to these radio talks shows , they are awesome !
matt , spokane u.s.a. i think the greatest problem with the entertainment industry as a whole is twofold .
one is the rampant growth of copyright violation , both in terms of laws lengthening the years a work stays under copyright and astounding ways companies try to protect their " intellectual properties . "
this is an industry that believes its customers are pirates who engage in " copyright theft " first and honest users second .
fair use rights have been thrown to the roadside for the benefit of business to increase profit margins .
it 's a telling soundbite when the head of sony says that " most people do n't know what a rootkit is , so why are they worried about it ? "
as the moral goes , " the more you squeeze your fingers , the more will slip through your grasp . "
kevin mason , tucson , arizona , usa having serious societal issues depicted in films -lrb- that might be released 2 or 3 time a year let 's say -rrb- is one thing however when the same issues -lrb- sexual / physical abuse for example -rrb- are turned into tv programs that air nightly in family homes and are called ' entertainment ' i am concerned about the long term effect on our communities subsequent perception of their own everyday world .
i wonder how we can on one hand react so vehemently to such emotional issues on our doorstep and yet have it turned into profit making ' entertainment ' without so much as a whimper ?
peter mackay , sydney australia -lrb- born in liverpool uk -rrb- booking fees on top of already expensive ticket prices - i booked four shows -lrb- two tickets for each show -rrb- and got charged a fee for each ticket on top of the ticket price .
also - why do n't they make it illegal to sell any ticket for more than its face value ?
surely that would stop touts and other crooks from thriving .
mick h , swindon wilts while i can see the many benefits of digital broadcasting , what does concern me is that not all viewers / listeners are equal .
where i live , i can not use a digital top set box or use a dab radio .
i 'm therefore forced to use rupert murdoch 's sky dish .
unfortunately many new channels that are available on freeview i can not receive unless i take out a full subscription with sky .
unless there is a commitment to an equity in public broadcasting delivery the technology is going alienate many people .
stuart barker , derbyshire , uk i 'm glad that grokster has closed , mainly because it will be interesting to see who the music people blame for loss of earnings if all the p2p programs closed down .
i 'm also mad about ticket touts .
it should be illegal to ticket tout , especially after the live 8 incident where callous people were selling live 8 tickets on ebay for massive profits in order to line their own pockets .
carl robertson , swindon , uk i object to laws being written at the behest of the entertainment industry which prevent me from performing legal actions .
i have the legal right to copy a dvd from the disk to another format yet the dmca and similar laws prevent me from doing this as to do so i would have to break the encryption on the disk .
this also prevents me from producing compilation clip disks to use in graduate film studies classes .
switching disks and finding points in films can cost up to 10 minutes per lecture , especially when disks prevent you from skipping the logos , trailers and copyright messages at the start .
richard feilden , santa barbara , usa copyright protection is becoming a joke with large companies having far too much influence on particularly american laws , which europe often rolls over for at some later point .
since piracy became prevalent -lrb- which i do not approve of -rrb- we have reasonably priced dvd 's and cd 's , improved speed of release , and simultaneous availability to stop the consumer being fleeced every which way possible .
i do not approve of piracy , but i applaud the results that piracy has had in putting these companies in their place , and i utterly resent their increasingly illegal attempts to squash us back down .
richard munro , uk you know what really grinds my gears bbc ?
dvd regions and the prospect of the new generation of blu ray having similar technology .
what is the point of regional coding ?
we supposedly live in a global capitalist market and yet there is a restriction on the international flow of information .
what i do n't understand is why people thought that it would be a good idea .
the most unpleasant thing it could is increase price competition for dvds .
this should be made illegal .
ross pearson , london , uk / athens , usa region restrictions on dvd players .
i legally purchase dvds from us and uk .
my computer dvd restricts the region -lrb- after 5 switches -rrb- what in reality are they trying to protect ?
i have bought a laptop to travel with .
it 's stupid that i am restricted on playing dvd from the countries i visit .
roo , usa the day dawneth when the tv and home computer become one .
i find the reception in my area bad , and no matter what i do ca n't find a good signal - hence i do n't watch much tv .
i am looking forward to using the new broadband tv service from the bbc when they roll it out next year .
for me this will enable me to watch my favourite programs , and like radio online i can watch it in my time .
we are living on the crest of the digital revolution , and our children will look back in school and wonder where it all happened .
we are living history , and through our computers we are shaping our world .
rachel saunders , preston , uk whatever happened to our national sense of pride in our theatres ?
in the first half of the 20th century , we had such luminaries as george bernard shaw , noel coward and laurence olivier , quite rightly regarded as legends in their own time because of their sheer ability to hold their own slightly skewed mirrors up to life .
in shakespeare 's time , people would cram into the stalls of the globe and others like it , just to see what new spectacle of emotion and fantasy would be brought alive before their very eyes .
today , we have , at the height of our cultural mountain ... yet another half-hearted , mangled production of a.n.other american playwright 's ' classic ' , naturally featuring a cast which consists primarily of hollywood ' here today , gone tomorrow ' tabloid darlings determined to ' tick off the stage ' before their 15 minutes is up .
meanwhile , that which is going on in the fringe venues of our capital city goes largely ignored by critics , in spite of the fact that it is often of far better all-round quality than the technical jiggery of the west end musicals .
krystina nellis , london , uk surely it is now time to move eastenders from its current slot to one that is beyond the watershed .
if this were a movie it would be deemed to be pg , particularly given the escalation in violence .
it does not make pleasant family viewing and is certainly not providing suitable storylines for those without adult supervision .
constant fisticuffs , gun toting gangsters and scenes of threatening behaviour towards females is not something the bbc should expose children to .
glenn , london , uk despite what the cinema adverts claim , copying a dvd is not stealing ...
it 's copyright infringement .
it is perfectly possible to download material you would not consider a high-enough priority to buy , even if downloading were not an option .
providing you leech and do not redistribute the material , doing so neither robs the author of the original content , nor of any revenue .
the corporations can get away with such falsehoods as to speak out as a consumer is to admit liability of copyright infringement !
anon , uk i buy both cds and vinyl records ; i buy a lot of vinyl records .
in order to mix up my music from two different sources i use mini disc component players hooked up to my amplifier .
i ca n't use i-pods or similar devices because i have no way of recording my music onto them using the amplifier / stereo .
i need to record all of my music , one time , onto one large database of some sort .
i love digital technology but have no intention to stop buying vinyl records so i really need a device which plugs into my amplifier so that i can record from both sources and store all my music in one place .
mike staley , hong kong i was so delighted to find that the fabulous eric clapton is touring again next year and returning to the royal albert hall in may .
i was stunned when i found that an arena ticket was going to cost me £ 60 plus a booking fee ! !
i am a huge fan and as such i 've paid the money as i want to see him play live , but , how can promoters and concert venues justify this kind of ticket price and what is the booking fee for ?
administration of the booking ?
is n't that what they 're paid to do ?
surely we spend enough as it is on albums and singles without having to stump up such high prices to see a live performance .
what do the artists think about this situation ?
gary bowyer , sutton , surrey what really annoys me about the fall of p2p networks is the fact that you may wish for your music to be heard by a wide audience - if like me you are in an unsigned band .
this medium can be ideal if you want to get your music out there .
i really despise the companies and artists who are totally against p2p .
in my opinion people should make music for the love of it and not expect automatically money in return , they should be honoured that people actually want to listen to their work .
anthony lloyd , warrington , england as a book publisher i 'm certain that big changes are around the corner for readers .
those changes will be led by fashion and the younger generation : give them an ipod-style ebook reader that is cool to carry , and they will realise the advantage at school and college of carrying one ' book ' around with them instead of dozens .
that one gadget can contain thousands of books - imagine taking one ' book ' on holiday containing everything you want to read instead of a heavy pile of novels .
if it takes off like the ipod there will be a craze for downloading ebooks .
the only snag is that the majority of books currently in print are not yet converted to ebooks and it will take a few years for the industry to catch up .
my company has converted to ebook formats 200 of its titles so far , but we have a long way to go .
stewart ferris , chichester , uk i am deaf and have been denied access to the professional theatre for 50-odd years apart from my learning lines and appearing in various amateur productions .
now we have stagetext who caption what is being said or sung by the actors / performers and even effects are written in as well -lrb- eg crash , bang , wallop ! -rrb-
stagetext was born in 2000 and now gives deaf people 100 % access to the theatre where they are actively involved .
but only a few productions are captioned and it is still an exercise in military planning to know which performance , where and at what time to go to in order to see / read these rare but treasured captioned shows .
michael theobald , london my family rented out ' valiant ' last night on dvd , and i noticed that the trailers at the start could not be skipped !

we supposedly live in a global capitalist market and yet there is a restriction on the international flow of information .
what i do n't understand is why people thought that it would be a good idea .
the most unpleasant thing it could is increase price competition for dvds .
this should be made illegal .
ross pearson , london , uk / athens , usa region restrictions on dvd players .
i legally purchase dvds from us and uk .
my computer dvd restricts the region -lrb- after 5 switches -rrb- what in reality are they trying to protect ?
i have bought a laptop to travel with .
it 's stupid that i am restricted on playing dvd from the countries i visit .
roo , usa the day dawneth when the tv and home computer become one .
i find the reception in my area bad , and no matter what i do ca n't find a good signal - hence i do n't watch much tv .
i am looking forward to using the new broadband tv service from the bbc when they roll it out next year .
for me this will enable me to watch my favourite programs , and like radio online i can watch it in my time .
we are living on the crest of the digital revolution , and our children will look back in school and wonder where it all happened .
we are living history , and through our computers we are shaping our world .
rachel saunders , preston , uk whatever happened to our national sense of pride in our theatres ?
in the first half of the 20th century , we had such luminaries as george bernard shaw , noel coward and laurence olivier , quite rightly regarded as legends in their own time because of their sheer ability to hold their own slightly skewed mirrors up to life .
in shakespeare 's time , people would cram into the stalls of the globe and others like it , just to see what new spectacle of emotion and fantasy would be brought alive before their very eyes .
today , we have , at the height of our cultural mountain ... yet another half-hearted , mangled production of a.n.other american playwright 's ' classic ' , naturally featuring a cast which consists primarily of hollywood ' here today , gone tomorrow ' tabloid darlings determined to ' tick off the stage ' before their 15 minutes is up .
meanwhile , that which is going on in the fringe venues of our capital city goes largely ignored by critics , in spite of the fact that it is often of far better all-round quality than the technical jiggery of the west end musicals .
krystina nellis , london , uk surely it is now time to move eastenders from its current slot to one that is beyond the watershed .
if this were a movie it would be deemed to be pg , particularly given the escalation in violence .
it does not make pleasant family viewing and is certainly not providing suitable storylines for those without adult supervision .
constant fisticuffs , gun toting gangsters and scenes of threatening behaviour towards females is not something the bbc should expose children to .
glenn , london , uk despite what the cinema adverts claim , copying a dvd is not stealing ...
it 's copyright infringement .
it is perfectly possible to download material you would not consider a high-enough priority to buy , even if downloading were not an option .
providing you leech and do not redistribute the material , doing so neither robs the author of the original content , nor of any revenue .
the corporations can get away with such falsehoods as to speak out as a consumer is to admit liability of copyright infringement !
anon , uk i buy both cds and vinyl records ; i buy a lot of vinyl records .
in order to mix up my music from two different sources i use mini disc component players hooked up to my amplifier .
i ca n't use i-pods or similar devices because i have no way of recording my music onto them using the amplifier / stereo .
i need to record all of my music , one time , onto one large database of some sort .
i love digital technology but have no intention to stop buying vinyl records so i really need a device which plugs into my amplifier so that i can record from both sources and store all my music in one place .
mike staley , hong kong i was so delighted to find that the fabulous eric clapton is touring again next year and returning to the royal albert hall in may .
i was stunned when i found that an arena ticket was going to cost me £ 60 plus a booking fee ! !
i am a huge fan and as such i 've paid the money as i want to see him play live , but , how can promoters and concert venues justify this kind of ticket price and what is the booking fee for ?
administration of the booking ?
is n't that what they 're paid to do ?
surely we spend enough as it is on albums and singles without having to stump up such high prices to see a live performance .
what do the artists think about this situation ?
gary bowyer , sutton , surrey what really annoys me about the fall of p2p networks is the fact that you may wish for your music to be heard by a wide audience - if like me you are in an unsigned band .
this medium can be ideal if you want to get your music out there .
i really despise the companies and artists who are totally against p2p .
in my opinion people should make music for the love of it and not expect automatically money in return , they should be honoured that people actually want to listen to their work .
anthony lloyd , warrington , england as a book publisher i 'm certain that big changes are around the corner for readers .
those changes will be led by fashion and the younger generation : give them an ipod-style ebook reader that is cool to carry , and they will realise the advantage at school and college of carrying one ' book ' around with them instead of dozens .
that one gadget can contain thousands of books - imagine taking one ' book ' on holiday containing everything you want to read instead of a heavy pile of novels .
if it takes off like the ipod there will be a craze for downloading ebooks .
the only snag is that the majority of books currently in print are not yet converted to ebooks and it will take a few years for the industry to catch up .
my company has converted to ebook formats 200 of its titles so far , but we have a long way to go .
stewart ferris , chichester , uk i am deaf and have been denied access to the professional theatre for 50-odd years apart from my learning lines and appearing in various amateur productions .
now we have stagetext who caption what is being said or sung by the actors / performers and even effects are written in as well -lrb- eg crash , bang , wallop ! -rrb-
stagetext was born in 2000 and now gives deaf people 100 % access to the theatre where they are actively involved .
but only a few productions are captioned and it is still an exercise in military planning to know which performance , where and at what time to go to in order to see / read these rare but treasured captioned shows .
michael theobald , london my family rented out ' valiant ' last night on dvd , and i noticed that the trailers at the start could not be skipped !
this also seems to be standard in disney titles on dvd , and i find it very frustrating not being able to control what i am watching on this medium .
steve , uk how can the download industry justify charging the same price for albums as buying the cd ?
the quality and lack of artwork and box plus all the associated packaging costs should bring the price down for mp3 quite considerably .
i do not buy any downloads because of this blatant rip-off .
david harpin , st albans , uk today i read about the grokster p2p service being forced to declare itself illegal .
what the entertainment industry fails to realise is that people use p2p to download copyrighted material because there is no " legal " way of doing so .
the success of itunes proves that once such a " legal " way is provided , take-up will be massive .
the tv and movie industries need to bring out their own versions of such systems in order to cut piracy .
jack , uk a big bugbear of mine are the extra ' fees ' for buying tickets for gigs or theatre .
there is an extortionate ' booking fee ' -lrb- especially when you buy online , and do all the work -rrb- , postage fees etc .
one time i bought a ticket of £ 8 face value , yet my credit card was charged approx £ 14 .
dave m , bedington , surrey , uk television advertising is not being viewed since the introduction of tivo and sky + , website advertising is n't being viewed , simply over-looked -lrb- we are more interested in the articles , not the flashy banners -rrb- and radio advertising just do n't exert themselves as much as they could !
the advertising and product placement industry is changing for the better , and with dynamic directions such as product placement in songs or even advertising within computer-games markets , we are able to adapt and work on having subliminal advertising .
this is something the world has always been appalled at , but i personally do n't think that this is anything to worry about .
mark hendrikx , london & berlin microsoft allow licence buyers to install there office software on both one desktop pc and one laptop , this is on the understanding that if the user is using the laptop they wo n't be using the desktop and vice versa .
perhaps the music industry should be looking at this also .
martin sherrit , aberdeen , scotland my main gripe is fair use of music that i have legally bought .
i 'm more than happy to pay out for new cds , but begrudge being told how i can use those cds for personal listening .
i think a policy of ' fair use ' needs to be adopted from the perspective of being able to rip cds that one has bought in order to play the music on another medium - such as an ipod .
i 'm hardly going to listen to the latest eric clapton album on cd and ipod at the same time !
there also needs to be more pressure placed on the music companies for supplying and selling cds that do not conform to the red book audio standard - ie they contain some form of copyright protection .
therefore , they should not carry the compact disc digital audio logo and also should not be marketed as audio cds , instead as cd-roms that carry audio tracks .
neil sherin , portsmouth , uk i am an unpublished novelist looking to the future of the publishing industry and staking my career on what i think is coming our way .
with the music industry reeling from the continuous onslaught from technology stripping away their business models , not much is said about the coming storm in the publishing world .
the only reason that publishing appears to be immune from the phenomenon -lrb- mass-migration to downloadable books -rrb- is that most people hate reading for extended periods on screen .
while many will be tired of the old mantra that we will all be reading electronic books in the near future ; this time it really is imminent .
sony , with its ill-conceived librie , demonstrates that the technology is here now .
if a far-sighted company followed apple 's example -lrb- ipod -rrb- to produce a device for readers using paper-like screens and -lrb- like apple -rrb- focused on selling the device instead of shoring up old business models , the resulting change in the publishing landscape would make that in the music industry seem glacial .
right out of the gate , there are thousands of classics available free from the gutenberg project - a great temptation to migrate to a well executed , paper-like device for all but the most bookish luddites on the planet .
in february i started the world 's first podcast-only novel and the first written straight to podcast .
my plan is to use this medium to grow an audience while keeping control of my work .
although produced directly to audiobook , tom corven is a traditional novel and its ultimate destination is in print .
i finished the tale last sunday and cast it to a small but respectable listener-base of approximately 2,500 people .
paul story , glasgow , scotland i do n't think british actors are paid the same amount as american " celebrities " and find this unfair .
british actors are far more talented and versatile than most of their american counterparts .

i have two gripes , both about dvds .
firstly i bought two new films on dvd recently - kung fu hustle & ong bak .
they are both good films , with great fighting scenes .
as they are chinese and thai , they have dubbed english audio .
kung fu hustle 's english audio is good , it sounds like chinese people that can speak english , which gives a more authentic feel to the film but ong bak 's english audio sounds like the cast of eastenders or emmerdale talking , it 's quite off putting .
for the amount of money films make , a little extra effort would not really make a dent in the profits .
my second moan is dvd prices - i was recently at stansted airport , where there is a sign outside the hmv store that says ' tax free prices for everyone ' .
i went in to see if i could pick up any bargains , i was shocked as the prices i was seeing were more expensive than prices i had seen in an hmv store in peterborough two days earlier .
how is this possible ?
is there some kind of airport tax added before the tax free offer is applied ?
surely they know people will notice .
paul stewart , chaunay , france regional restrictions on dvds make me very angry too !
i live in the usa but i love cinema from all over the world .
i find it very frustrating that i ca n't buy a dvd of , say , an australian movie or a british movie online , and guarantee i can play it here .
why ca n't dvds be like cds ?
not all of us are pirating these things - we just want to be able to see a wide range of world cinema at home , especially movies which may not even have been released in theatres here in the usa .
isabelle , brit in usa podcasts .
more people should know and listen to these radio talks shows , they are awesome !
matt , spokane u.s.a. i think the greatest problem with the entertainment industry as a whole is twofold .
one is the rampant growth of copyright violation , both in terms of laws lengthening the years a work stays under copyright and astounding ways companies try to protect their " intellectual properties . "
this is an industry that believes its customers are pirates who engage in " copyright theft " first and honest users second .
fair use rights have been thrown to the roadside for the benefit of business to increase profit margins .
it 's a telling soundbite when the head of sony says that " most people do n't know what a rootkit is , so why are they worried about it ? "
as the moral goes , " the more you squeeze your fingers , the more will slip through your grasp . "
kevin mason , tucson , arizona , usa having serious societal issues depicted in films -lrb- that might be released 2 or 3 time a year let 's say -rrb- is one thing however when the same issues -lrb- sexual / physical abuse for example -rrb- are turned into tv programs that air nightly in family homes and are called ' entertainment ' i am concerned about the long term effect on our communities subsequent perception of their own everyday world .
i wonder how we can on one hand react so vehemently to such emotional issues on our doorstep and yet have it turned into profit making ' entertainment ' without so much as a whimper ?
peter mackay , sydney australia -lrb- born in liverpool uk -rrb- booking fees on top of already expensive ticket prices - i booked four shows -lrb- two tickets for each show -rrb- and got charged a fee for each ticket on top of the ticket price .
also - why do n't they make it illegal to sell any ticket for more than its face value ?
surely that would stop touts and other crooks from thriving .
mick h , swindon wilts while i can see the many benefits of digital broadcasting , what does concern me is that not all viewers / listeners are equal .
where i live , i can not use a digital top set box or use a dab radio .
i 'm therefore forced to use rupert murdoch 's sky dish .
unfortunately many new channels that are available on freeview i can not receive unless i take out a full subscription with sky .
unless there is a commitment to an equity in public broadcasting delivery the technology is going alienate many people .
stuart barker , derbyshire , uk i 'm glad that grokster has closed , mainly because it will be interesting to see who the music people blame for loss of earnings if all the p2p programs closed down .
i 'm also mad about ticket touts .
it should be illegal to ticket tout , especially after the live 8 incident where callous people were selling live 8 tickets on ebay for massive profits in order to line their own pockets .
carl robertson , swindon , uk i object to laws being written at the behest of the entertainment industry which prevent me from performing legal actions .
i have the legal right to copy a dvd from the disk to another format yet the dmca and similar laws prevent me from doing this as to do so i would have to break the encryption on the disk .
this also prevents me from producing compilation clip disks to use in graduate film studies classes .
switching disks and finding points in films can cost up to 10 minutes per lecture , especially when disks prevent you from skipping the logos , trailers and copyright messages at the start .
richard feilden , santa barbara , usa copyright protection is becoming a joke with large companies having far too much influence on particularly american laws , which europe often rolls over for at some later point .
since piracy became prevalent -lrb- which i do not approve of -rrb- we have reasonably priced dvd 's and cd 's , improved speed of release , and simultaneous availability to stop the consumer being fleeced every which way possible .
i do not approve of piracy , but i applaud the results that piracy has had in putting these companies in their place , and i utterly resent their increasingly illegal attempts to squash us back down .
richard munro , uk you know what really grinds my gears bbc ?
dvd regions and the prospect of the new generation of blu ray having similar technology .
what is the point of regional coding ?
we supposedly live in a global capitalist market and yet there is a restriction on the international flow of information .

due to technical difficulties , messages sent before 1530 gmt on sunday 6 november were not received .
i have two gripes , both about dvds .
firstly i bought two new films on dvd recently - kung fu hustle & ong bak .
they are both good films , with great fighting scenes .
as they are chinese and thai , they have dubbed english audio .
kung fu hustle 's english audio is good , it sounds like chinese people that can speak english , which gives a more authentic feel to the film but ong bak 's english audio sounds like the cast of eastenders or emmerdale talking , it 's quite off putting .
for the amount of money films make , a little extra effort would not really make a dent in the profits .
my second moan is dvd prices - i was recently at stansted airport , where there is a sign outside the hmv store that says ' tax free prices for everyone ' .
i went in to see if i could pick up any bargains , i was shocked as the prices i was seeing were more expensive than prices i had seen in an hmv store in peterborough two days earlier .
how is this possible ?
is there some kind of airport tax added before the tax free offer is applied ?
surely they know people will notice .
paul stewart , chaunay , france regional restrictions on dvds make me very angry too !
i live in the usa but i love cinema from all over the world .
i find it very frustrating that i ca n't buy a dvd of , say , an australian movie or a british movie online , and guarantee i can play it here .
why ca n't dvds be like cds ?
not all of us are pirating these things - we just want to be able to see a wide range of world cinema at home , especially movies which may not even have been released in theatres here in the usa .
isabelle , brit in usa podcasts .
more people should know and listen to these radio talks shows , they are awesome !
matt , spokane u.s.a. i think the greatest problem with the entertainment industry as a whole is twofold .
one is the rampant growth of copyright violation , both in terms of laws lengthening the years a work stays under copyright and astounding ways companies try to protect their " intellectual properties . "
this is an industry that believes its customers are pirates who engage in " copyright theft " first and honest users second .
fair use rights have been thrown to the roadside for the benefit of business to increase profit margins .
it 's a telling soundbite when the head of sony says that " most people do n't know what a rootkit is , so why are they worried about it ? "
as the moral goes , " the more you squeeze your fingers , the more will slip through your grasp . "
kevin mason , tucson , arizona , usa having serious societal issues depicted in films -lrb- that might be released 2 or 3 time a year let 's say -rrb- is one thing however when the same issues -lrb- sexual / physical abuse for example -rrb- are turned into tv programs that air nightly in family homes and are called ' entertainment ' i am concerned about the long term effect on our communities subsequent perception of their own everyday world .
i wonder how we can on one hand react so vehemently to such emotional issues on our doorstep and yet have it turned into profit making ' entertainment ' without so much as a whimper ?
peter mackay , sydney australia -lrb- born in liverpool uk -rrb- booking fees on top of already expensive ticket prices - i booked four shows -lrb- two tickets for each show -rrb- and got charged a fee for each ticket on top of the ticket price .
also - why do n't they make it illegal to sell any ticket for more than its face value ?
surely that would stop touts and other crooks from thriving .
mick h , swindon wilts while i can see the many benefits of digital broadcasting , what does concern me is that not all viewers / listeners are equal .
where i live , i can not use a digital top set box or use a dab radio .
i 'm therefore forced to use rupert murdoch 's sky dish .
unfortunately many new channels that are available on freeview i can not receive unless i take out a full subscription with sky .
unless there is a commitment to an equity in public broadcasting delivery the technology is going alienate many people .
stuart barker , derbyshire , uk i 'm glad that grokster has closed , mainly because it will be interesting to see who the music people blame for loss of earnings if all the p2p programs closed down .
i 'm also mad about ticket touts .
it should be illegal to ticket tout , especially after the live 8 incident where callous people were selling live 8 tickets on ebay for massive profits in order to line their own pockets .
carl robertson , swindon , uk i object to laws being written at the behest of the entertainment industry which prevent me from performing legal actions .
i have the legal right to copy a dvd from the disk to another format yet the dmca and similar laws prevent me from doing this as to do so i would have to break the encryption on the disk .
this also prevents me from producing compilation clip disks to use in graduate film studies classes .
switching disks and finding points in films can cost up to 10 minutes per lecture , especially when disks prevent you from skipping the logos , trailers and copyright messages at the start .
richard feilden , santa barbara , usa copyright protection is becoming a joke with large companies having far too much influence on particularly american laws , which europe often rolls over for at some later point .
since piracy became prevalent -lrb- which i do not approve of -rrb- we have reasonably priced dvd 's and cd 's , improved speed of release , and simultaneous availability to stop the consumer being fleeced every which way possible .
i do not approve of piracy , but i applaud the results that piracy has had in putting these companies in their place , and i utterly resent their increasingly illegal attempts to squash us back down .
richard munro , uk you know what really grinds my gears bbc ?
dvd regions and the prospect of the new generation of blu ray having similar technology .
what is the point of regional coding ?
we supposedly live in a global capitalist market and yet there is a restriction on the international flow of information .
what i do n't understand is why people thought that it would be a good idea .
the most unpleasant thing it could is increase price competition for dvds .
this should be made illegal .
ross pearson , london , uk / athens , usa region restrictions on dvd players .
i legally purchase dvds from us and uk .
my computer dvd restricts the region -lrb- after 5 switches -rrb- what in reality are they trying to protect ?
i have bought a laptop to travel with .
it 's stupid that i am restricted on playing dvd from the countries i visit .
roo , usa the day dawneth when the tv and home computer become one .
i find the reception in my area bad , and no matter what i do ca n't find a good signal - hence i do n't watch much tv .
i am looking forward to using the new broadband tv service from the bbc when they roll it out next year .
for me this will enable me to watch my favourite programs , and like radio online i can watch it in my time .
we are living on the crest of the digital revolution , and our children will look back in school and wonder where it all happened .
we are living history , and through our computers we are shaping our world .
rachel saunders , preston , uk whatever happened to our national sense of pride in our theatres ?
in the first half of the 20th century , we had such luminaries as george bernard shaw , noel coward and laurence olivier , quite rightly regarded as legends in their own time because of their sheer ability to hold their own slightly skewed mirrors up to life .
in shakespeare 's time , people would cram into the stalls of the globe and others like it , just to see what new spectacle of emotion and fantasy would be brought alive before their very eyes .
today , we have , at the height of our cultural mountain ... yet another half-hearted , mangled production of a.n.other american playwright 's ' classic ' , naturally featuring a cast which consists primarily of hollywood ' here today , gone tomorrow ' tabloid darlings determined to ' tick off the stage ' before their 15 minutes is up .
meanwhile , that which is going on in the fringe venues of our capital city goes largely ignored by critics , in spite of the fact that it is often of far better all-round quality than the technical jiggery of the west end musicals .
krystina nellis , london , uk surely it is now time to move eastenders from its current slot to one that is beyond the watershed .
if this were a movie it would be deemed to be pg , particularly given the escalation in violence .
it does not make pleasant family viewing and is certainly not providing suitable storylines for those without adult supervision .
constant fisticuffs , gun toting gangsters and scenes of threatening behaviour towards females is not something the bbc should expose children to .
glenn , london , uk despite what the cinema adverts claim , copying a dvd is not stealing ...
it 's copyright infringement .
it is perfectly possible to download material you would not consider a high-enough priority to buy , even if downloading were not an option .
providing you leech and do not redistribute the material , doing so neither robs the author of the original content , nor of any revenue .
the corporations can get away with such falsehoods as to speak out as a consumer is to admit liability of copyright infringement !
anon , uk i buy both cds and vinyl records ; i buy a lot of vinyl records .
in order to mix up my music from two different sources i use mini disc component players hooked up to my amplifier .
i ca n't use i-pods or similar devices because i have no way of recording my music onto them using the amplifier / stereo .
i need to record all of my music , one time , onto one large database of some sort .
i love digital technology but have no intention to stop buying vinyl records so i really need a device which plugs into my amplifier so that i can record from both sources and store all my music in one place .
mike staley , hong kong i was so delighted to find that the fabulous eric clapton is touring again next year and returning to the royal albert hall in may .
i was stunned when i found that an arena ticket was going to cost me £ 60 plus a booking fee ! !
i am a huge fan and as such i 've paid the money as i want to see him play live , but , how can promoters and concert venues justify this kind of ticket price and what is the booking fee for ?
administration of the booking ?
is n't that what they 're paid to do ?
surely we spend enough as it is on albums and singles without having to stump up such high prices to see a live performance .
what do the artists think about this situation ?
gary bowyer , sutton , surrey what really annoys me about the fall of p2p networks is the fact that you may wish for your music to be heard by a wide audience - if like me you are in an unsigned band .
this medium can be ideal if you want to get your music out there .
i really despise the companies and artists who are totally against p2p .
in my opinion people should make music for the love of it and not expect automatically money in return , they should be honoured that people actually want to listen to their work .
anthony lloyd , warrington , england as a book publisher i 'm certain that big changes are around the corner for readers .
those changes will be led by fashion and the younger generation : give them an ipod-style ebook reader that is cool to carry , and they will realise the advantage at school and college of carrying one ' book ' around with them instead of dozens .
that one gadget can contain thousands of books - imagine taking one ' book ' on holiday containing everything you want to read instead of a heavy pile of novels .
if it takes off like the ipod there will be a craze for downloading ebooks .
the only snag is that the majority of books currently in print are not yet converted to ebooks and it will take a few years for the industry to catch up .
my company has converted to ebook formats 200 of its titles so far , but we have a long way to go .
stewart ferris , chichester , uk i am deaf and have been denied access to the professional theatre for 50-odd years apart from my learning lines and appearing in various amateur productions .
now we have stagetext who caption what is being said or sung by the actors / performers and even effects are written in as well -lrb- eg crash , bang , wallop ! -rrb-
stagetext was born in 2000 and now gives deaf people 100 % access to the theatre where they are actively involved .
but only a few productions are captioned and it is still an exercise in military planning to know which performance , where and at what time to go to in order to see / read these rare but treasured captioned shows .
michael theobald , london my family rented out ' valiant ' last night on dvd , and i noticed that the trailers at the start could not be skipped !
this also seems to be standard in disney titles on dvd , and i find it very frustrating not being able to control what i am watching on this medium .
steve , uk how can the download industry justify charging the same price for albums as buying the cd ?
the quality and lack of artwork and box plus all the associated packaging costs should bring the price down for mp3 quite considerably .
i do not buy any downloads because of this blatant rip-off .
david harpin , st albans , uk today i read about the grokster p2p service being forced to declare itself illegal .
what the entertainment industry fails to realise is that people use p2p to download copyrighted material because there is no " legal " way of doing so .
the success of itunes proves that once such a " legal " way is provided , take-up will be massive .
the tv and movie industries need to bring out their own versions of such systems in order to cut piracy .
jack , uk a big bugbear of mine are the extra ' fees ' for buying tickets for gigs or theatre .
there is an extortionate ' booking fee ' -lrb- especially when you buy online , and do all the work -rrb- , postage fees etc .
one time i bought a ticket of £ 8 face value , yet my credit card was charged approx £ 14 .
dave m , bedington , surrey , uk television advertising is not being viewed since the introduction of tivo and sky + , website advertising is n't being viewed , simply over-looked -lrb- we are more interested in the articles , not the flashy banners -rrb- and radio advertising just do n't exert themselves as much as they could !
the advertising and product placement industry is changing for the better , and with dynamic directions such as product placement in songs or even advertising within computer-games markets , we are able to adapt and work on having subliminal advertising .
this is something the world has always been appalled at , but i personally do n't think that this is anything to worry about .
mark hendrikx , london & berlin microsoft allow licence buyers to install there office software on both one desktop pc and one laptop , this is on the understanding that if the user is using the laptop they wo n't be using the desktop and vice versa .
perhaps the music industry should be looking at this also .
martin sherrit , aberdeen , scotland my main gripe is fair use of music that i have legally bought .
i 'm more than happy to pay out for new cds , but begrudge being told how i can use those cds for personal listening .
i think a policy of ' fair use ' needs to be adopted from the perspective of being able to rip cds that one has bought in order to play the music on another medium - such as an ipod .
i 'm hardly going to listen to the latest eric clapton album on cd and ipod at the same time !
there also needs to be more pressure placed on the music companies for supplying and selling cds that do not conform to the red book audio standard - ie they contain some form of copyright protection .
therefore , they should not carry the compact disc digital audio logo and also should not be marketed as audio cds , instead as cd-roms that carry audio tracks .
neil sherin , portsmouth , uk i am an unpublished novelist looking to the future of the publishing industry and staking my career on what i think is coming our way .
with the music industry reeling from the continuous onslaught from technology stripping away their business models , not much is said about the coming storm in the publishing world .
the only reason that publishing appears to be immune from the phenomenon -lrb- mass-migration to downloadable books -rrb- is that most people hate reading for extended periods on screen .
while many will be tired of the old mantra that we will all be reading electronic books in the near future ; this time it really is imminent .
sony , with its ill-conceived librie , demonstrates that the technology is here now .
if a far-sighted company followed apple 's example -lrb- ipod -rrb- to produce a device for readers using paper-like screens and -lrb- like apple -rrb- focused on selling the device instead of shoring up old business models , the resulting change in the publishing landscape would make that in the music industry seem glacial .
right out of the gate , there are thousands of classics available free from the gutenberg project - a great temptation to migrate to a well executed , paper-like device for all but the most bookish luddites on the planet .
in february i started the world 's first podcast-only novel and the first written straight to podcast .
my plan is to use this medium to grow an audience while keeping control of my work .
although produced directly to audiobook , tom corven is a traditional novel and its ultimate destination is in print .
i finished the tale last sunday and cast it to a small but respectable listener-base of approximately 2,500 people .
paul story , glasgow , scotland i do n't think british actors are paid the same amount as american " celebrities " and find this unfair .
british actors are far more talented and versatile than most of their american counterparts .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- madonna 's last dancefloor confession ?

by tom bishop bbc news entertainment reporter madonna has headed back to the disco for her new album , confessions on a dancefloor , which is released in the uk on monday .
it has earned her some of the best reviews of her 22-year career .
in stark contrast to 2003 's introspective american life album , she has dusted off her glitterball , strapped on her pink stilettos and sampled abba on latest hit single hung up .
madonna embraced new york club culture in the early 1980s has madonna reinvigorated her music career , or is she merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material ?
" dance music fans may be unconvinced by madonna 's new image as it no longer reflects her real life , " says dj magazine 's features editor carl loben .
" madonna embraced the early stages of new york club culture in the 1980s but i doubt she has been into a club for years . "
respected producer however , mr loben says madonna was very astute to work on her new album with stuart price , the respected producer and remixer behind dance acts les rythmes digitales and zoot woman .
the fact that madonna is releasing a second continuous dj mix version of confessions on a dancefloor will also appeal to dance music fans , mr loben says .
" clubbers are generally open to any music as long as it sounds good on the dancefloor . "
some of our readers say she should grow old a bit more gracefully ian eddy , smash hits while clubbers are relatively unconcerned by the age of an artist , madonna has been permanently ousted from the cover of smash hits magazine by acts such as teen stars mcfly and son of dork .
staff writer ian eddy says teenage music fans judge madonna on a song-by-song basis .
" pop fans are a bit fickle , " he says .
" if her next single is a bit of a dud they wo n't bother with it . "
smash hits readers were divided in their opinion of madonna 's promo video for her single hung up , in which the 47-year-old contorts herself in a pink leotard and flirts with young dancers .
" a lot of our readers are saying madonna has still got it , that she is still youthful , " says mr eddy , " but some say she should grow old a bit more gracefully . "
young pop stars may cite madonna as a music or fashion influence , but teenage music fans " just do n't have the same affection for her as people in their 30s do " .
madonna 's gay audience has always been very forgiving , perhaps too forgiving matt miles , axm magazine madonna 's most loyal fan group has been gay men , which gay magazine axm attributes to her eye for fashion and music trends , and her ever-changing image .
" many gay people want to break away from their past , and every six months madonna goes into a cocoon then emerges as a new butterfly , " says axm editor matt miles .
she strengthened her gay and lesbian fanbase by challenging sexual and religious convention in promo videos such as like a prayer and justify my love , suggestive live performances and 1992 's explicit sex photo book .
" madonna 's gay audience has always been very forgiving , perhaps too forgiving , " says mr miles .
" it would take an awful lot to put gay men off her . "
mr miles says it is understandable why madonna would want to " throw herself back into the gay bosom " with a new hi-energy album , after the relative failure of american life .
" why not ?
it does n't seem too cynical , and it worked for kylie minogue .
it is as if madonna is sampling the 1980s but making it better . "
when not making dance records , madonna is a children 's author gay fans believe madonna 's career will match the longevity of that other iconic us singer , cher .
if her songs match her ambition , she may also retain her revived mainstream audience .
mr eddy says : " madonna really thinks of herself as young .
i ca n't see her sticking to dance music but she could easily come back in a few years with something fresh . "
" madonna may return to the slower beats of her ray of light album or move into torch songs , " adds mr miles .
" she would probably like to turn herself into a cartoon , and is kicking herself that gorillaz got there first . "
he concludes : " she is pushing 50 and still looks great .
i would n't put it past her to be swinging off a trapeze at the age of 60 . "

its hold on the top slot was revealed in the latest list of the top 500 supercomputers on earth .
blue gene / l was top of the biannually produced list because in june 2005 it set a new world record performance of 280.6 trillion calculations per second .
it could head supercomputer rankings for a while as it has still not reached its maximum possible performance .

its hold on the top slot was revealed in the latest list of the top 500 supercomputers on earth .
blue gene / l was top of the biannually produced list because in june 2005 it set a new world record performance of 280.6 trillion calculations per second .
it could head supercomputer rankings for a while as it has still not reached its maximum possible performance .
power play the machines in the top two slots of the top 500 are unchanged from the last list produced in june 2005 and both are ibm blue gene machines .
blue gene / l is installed at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california and the other blue gene machine is at ibm 's thomas j watson research lab in new york state .
the blue gene / l machine has doubled in size since the last list was compiled and now harnesses the computational power of more than 130,000 processors .
although it set a record by carrying out more than 280.6 trillion calculations per second -lrb- teraflops -rrb- , it has a theoretical maximum performance in excess of 367 teraflops .
no other supercomputer has broken the 100 teraflops barrier .
this could mean that it breaks the record for the machine that stays longest in the number one slot on the top 500 list .
nec 's earth simulator machine , with a peak performance of 35.86 teraflops , topped five consecutive lists .
now that machine has slipped to the number seven position .

the increase in computational power of the blue gene / l shows the rapid pace of supercomputer development .
in the latest top 500 , four of the top 10 systems from the previous list were bumped out by more powerful machines .
new in at the number three position is the asci purple system that is also based at the lawrence livermore lab .
the entry level for the top 10 machines is 20.53 teraflops , even though a year ago it was just under 10 teraflops .
to make it into the top 500 , supercomputers must be capable of at least 1.64 teraflops performance .

its hold on the top slot was revealed in the latest list of the top 500 supercomputers on earth .
blue gene / l was top of the biannually produced list because in june 2005 it set a new world record performance of 280.6 trillion calculations per second .
it could head supercomputer rankings for a while as it has still not reached its maximum possible performance .
power play the machines in the top two slots of the top 500 are unchanged from the last list produced in june 2005 and both are ibm blue gene machines .
blue gene / l is installed at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california and the other blue gene machine is at ibm 's thomas j watson research lab in new york state .
the blue gene / l machine has doubled in size since the last list was compiled and now harnesses the computational power of more than 130,000 processors .
although it set a record by carrying out more than 280.6 trillion calculations per second -lrb- teraflops -rrb- , it has a theoretical maximum performance in excess of 367 teraflops .
no other supercomputer has broken the 100 teraflops barrier .
this could mean that it breaks the record for the machine that stays longest in the number one slot on the top 500 list .

the tattooed heads , and a thigh bone , are believed to belong to maori chiefs killed in battle in the 19th century .
they were donated to the kelvingrove museum , although they have never been shown in public .
a delegation from new zealand 's national museum te papa arrives in glasgow on monday to return the heads and offer them for tribal burial .
in maori culture the heads are known as toi moko .
one was purchased by glasgow museums from a liverpool menagerie in 1906 .
the other two were donated to the city by a collector in 1951 .
archibald shanks donated the heads 50 years after purchasing them from the blair museum in dalry in 1901 .
' right thing ' an undated extract from the diary of mr shanks said that one of the heads was of a new zealand chief who had 40 wives .
they were never put on public display because as human remains , they can not be legally owned by the council , only entrusted to them .
glasgow city council 's repatriation of artefacts working group decided last year to return the remains .
the group said it was " the right thing to do " .
the te papa museum will try to identify which tribe the remains come from and then return them for disposal .

this is despite being told by the eu to change the way contracts are awarded .
the european commission wants a " viable and meaningful " share of live matches after the current deal , in which bskyb holds all live rights , ends in 2007 .
mr kenyon told the soccerex conference in dubai he was " fully confident " that previous funding levels could be met .
he added that the forthcoming deal was " crucially important " for the game 's wellbeing .
funding from television was the catalyst which had made the premier league successful over the past 13 years , mr kenyon said , and had helped to fund the building of new stadiums in england .
great show however , he warned that there had to be a balance between the number of games on television and ensuring that stadiums were full .
" we do not want the doomsday scenario where stadiums are empty but we are getting all our money from television , " he said .
" it is having full stadiums that make the great tv spectacles . "
even at the highest level , stadiums are left with empty seats in august 2003 , the premier league awarded all four of its rights packages to sky in a deal worth £ 1.024bn.
there have been a number of recent meetings between premier league executives and the commission to try and seek a compromise over the make-up of the next deal , which will cover the 2007-2010 seasons .
it is understood the league is proposing to offer six packages of 23 matches each , with no single broadcaster permitted to buy more than five .
if the ec is satisfied with the league 's clarification of certain aspects of the intended bidding process , then those balances should form part of a final proposal to be submitted to brussels for competition commissioner nellie kroes ' approval .
" in the short and medium term ... the next tv deal is critically important , " said mr kenyon .
other important issues facing the game at present were ensuring that both clubs and national teams were satisfied with their access to players , and a perceived dip in the number of fans attending live matches .
tug of war mr kenyon , who has overseen the buying of many global stars by the premiership champions chelsea , said clubs and world governing bodies had to come together to discuss issues of compensation for top clubs who release players for international games , and an attempt had to be made to draw up a cohesive international football calendar .
" it is a fact many players get back -lsb- from international duty -rsb- on a thursday , and they will have a big game on the saturday , " he observed .
players like didier drogba have to travel for national team matches " in the last week at chelsea all but four of our players were away on international duty .
football ca n't keep piling more and more games on , many of them meaningless friendlies .
" the authorities and clubs have to get round the table , it ca n't be beyond the brains of all of us to find a solution . "
while noting that chelsea had suffered from empty seats in the early rounds of the champions league this season , he put this down to the opposition and timing of the games at the start of the season , and went on to say that " keeping the domestic league healthy " was of prime importance .
" the premier league is a great product , one of the best in the world , and gets fantastic exposure on tv , but we ca n't become complacent , " mr kenyon continued .
he denied claims that the competition was becoming stale , with only a handful of clubs capable of winning it , among them chelsea who are bankrolled by roman abramovich 's billions .
" it is competitive - there is not a game we go into that we take for granted to get a result .
we sell out our premier league games , which are over-subscribed . "
staying put he said chelsea remained committed to the competition and that no moves were afoot among leading sides in europe to create a super league .
" we do n't want to play ac milan or bayern munich every week - it is not what our supporters want , " he said .
mr kenyon reiterated his previous desire to see chelsea profitable within five years .
" we are continually checking our costs on and off the field , and looking to increasing revenues domestically and internationally , " he said .
