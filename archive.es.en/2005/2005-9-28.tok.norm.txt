program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2005 stores get creative to lure business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while parents shop , the kids can play - or carve pumpkins german retail has been suffering for years now , but more and more shopkeepers are finding new ways to bring customers through their doors - and keep them there . dinger 's garden center in cologne is like any other large nursery , with row after row of seedlings , bushes and flowers lining light-filled hothouses .
but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .

in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .

" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "

a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .
but what the governments sent eichel and what eastern germany 's most prominent economic institute found are miles apart . accusations of misappropriation brandenburg 's social democratic-conservative party coalition government , for example , said that it spent 89 percent of the 1.5 billion euros received last year on the reconstruction projects the money was intended for .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .
" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .
" if i pay a teacher , is that not an investment ? " rainer speer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel wo n't be happy the report is not likely to please eichel , who on monday faced renewed pressure from the european union to bring germany 's debt to below 3 percent of total gross domestic product , a stipulation of the stability and growth pace intended to control spending in the 12 euro-zone countries .
in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .
under current terms , the pact calls for the transfer of up to 156 billion euros to the east until 2019 . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report highlights eastern german economic successes though it has chronic unemployment and has struggled to gain a foothold in the post-reunification era , eastern germany is n't as doom and gloom as it may seem .

but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .

but the extra soldiers in the area will not be able to resolve afghanistan 's difficulties . there are two faces to the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan .

it is a long and dangerous process to move forward in a country where it 's impossible to get an overview of who is in control where . taliban supporters , drug barons and local warlords all want to get rid of the foreign troops - a fact they prove with their regular attacks on isaf and the 20,000 additional us troops stationed in afghanistan . the situation in afghanistan is so complicated that there are in fact two mandates from the german parliament for the soldiers it sends .
two mandates for a country with two faces : the one that was extended wednesday for security troops and another for the fight against terrorism , that will be up for debate again in november .
and it does n't look like either one of them will be ending soon as the tasks for german troops are piling up . soldiers ca n't guarantee peace in addition to the extra troops , the bundeswehr will be taking over nato 's responsibility for the entire northern part of the country .
but that is by no means a guarantee for a lasting peace in the region .
the north is where that the drug trade is flourishing , and the new mandate will not take any steps against it , as the troops would certainly be overextended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither soldiers not government officials are able to destroy the opium-producing poppy fields despite its promises to double its efforts , the afghan government is still unable to counteract the drug barons .

now that afghans have elected a president and parliament and enacted a constitution , they will have to set up a time plan for the how the country will move itself forward economically without additional income from illegal opium sales . otherwise isaf can continue to prolong its presence for the next 20 years without addressing afghanistan 's actual problems . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .
they can still take part .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

after all , hundertwasser did n't shy away from projects where people are most shy , one of the most well-known being the kawakawa public toilet in new zealand .
in magdeburg , business leaders are more pragmatic . " the public toilet 's tenant has the last word , " said ute siebrecht of the marketing association centrum aqua . murder on the roof more visible on the roof are some 9,000 bushes .
harel would like to see these removed also because they look too much like a garden .
in other words , the human touch is too present .
he would prefer that a meadow of wild flowers be planted . removing the shrubs with a value of over 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- would raise rent prices excessively according to centrum aqua .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

harel would like to see these removed also because they look too much like a garden .
in other words , the human touch is too present .
he would prefer that a meadow of wild flowers be planted . removing the shrubs with a value of over 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- would raise rent prices excessively according to centrum aqua .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification german east accused of misappropriation culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.09.2005 reunification 's cultural challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite their differences the two germanies shared a cultural base politically and economically speaking , the two german states couldn ’ t have been more different after 40 years of separation .
but the common cultural tradition was considered the basis for one nation . " we are the people ! " was the political slogan east germans shouted when they fought for freedom under a communist regime .
it turned into " we are one people ! " when bavarian conservatives joined their ranks at the infamous monday demonstrations in leipzig .
not much later , the berlin wall fell .
on oct .
3 , 1990 , germany reunited . since then , the two germanys have been getting to know each other better and coming to a better understanding of their differences .
the art world , as one example , is still learning about the preferences of art buyers in east and west . eastern german art gallerist gerd-harry lybcke is credited with discovering the so-called " leipzig school " of artists working in the eastern germany city who , years after the fall of the wall , revived a style of literal realism that fell out of favor in west germany in the 1970s and ' 80s . paintings in this style are a hot commodity on the international art scene , but lybcke , who opened his gallery eigen + art in leipzig in 1986 , does n't sell works from the popular artists to collectors in germany 's east .
the economic upswing has still not happened there .
money is made elsewhere . the allure of the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " vorstadt , " christoph ruckhaeberle , 2002 despite the relative lack of wealth in the east , lybcke says excellent young artists come to leipzig from the west to study .
in the ' wild ' east , there is a certain inspiration for artistic expression lacking in the west . " they have experienced wealth where it feels so empty , " lybcke said .
" now , they come to a fairly poor state in the east and discover the cultural abundance here .
as an artist , you can discover yourself .
there 's so much that has n't been done .
you take responsibility for your artistic position .
being responsible for what you 're doing is an ideal situation to shape a character . " germany 's eastern states need to spend far more money on the arts than the western states in order to maintain the extensive artistic infrastructure built by the communist regime .
at the time of the fall of the wall , east germany had an impressive number of state-funded cultural institutions : 217 theaters , 87 symphony orchestras , 955 museums , more than 200 music schools , 9,349 libraries and 250,000 architectural and historical monuments . returning eastern cities to their former glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new palace in potsdam , one of east germany 's jewels gottfried kiesow , head of germany 's foundation for the protection of historical monuments , says germany paid almost $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- for cultural programs and architectural renovation in the first three years after unification . " east german cities were in a decrepit state , because so little was done to maintain buildings under the socialists , " kiesow explained .
" very few buildings were modernized .
most were poorly maintained .
but generally , historic buildings remained intact .
in the west , entire city centers were scarred by shopping malls and advertising .
in the east , town planners who did little made few mistakes , " he said . entire cities in the east needed to be renovated after the wall came down , but fortunately the historic substance was never lost .
in the past 15 years , the cultural centers of weimar , potsdam , leipzig , dresden and görlitz have blossomed . palaces , castles and townhouses , theaters , memorials and museums have been restored at great expense .
today , they again demonstrate the heights of a germany 's common cultural tradition in the 18th and 19th centuries .
they have become places of national identity - and lucrative tourist destinations . the arts as a catalyst for cultural reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schiller museum in weimar , a german cultural treasure hellmut seemann , president of the weimar classic foundation , believes the arts can play an important role in the continuing process of cultural unification .
" on average , people in the east are less successful , less productive and not as wealthy .
materially speaking , they 're less happy , " seemann said .
" but that 's exactly why cultural diversity in the eastern states plays a more important role than in the west .
people in eastern germany are aware that there are things which are more important than making money and paying taxes .
they see the arts as a creative process of ' togetherness . '
we need to strengthen this consciousness , because that 's the only way to ensure culture and society continues to thrive - regardless of where we stand economically in the years to come .

but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification .

but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor . visibly tired , but satisfied , representatives of germany 's two major parties appeared before cameras wednesday night after a long day of talks they said focused on the economic challenges facing germany .
chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim .

but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor . visibly tired , but satisfied , representatives of germany 's two major parties appeared before cameras wednesday night after a long day of talks they said focused on the economic challenges facing germany .
chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim . " talking points spd general secretary klaus uwe benneter stessed in an interview with zdf public telelvision ahead of the talks that his party would stick behind chancellor schröder .
but cdu steering committee member hildegard müller insisted that as the strongest party , the union should - and would - lead the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , schröder meanwhile , norbert röttgen , parliamentary spokesman for the conservative christian democratic union , told the berliner zeitung on wednesday that there are four major challenges facing a grand coalition government .
these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .
speaking to zdf , the spd 's benneter agreed these points will also be addressed in the exploratory talks .
moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .
but he reiterated that the main objective is to form a stable government .
cdu seeks change in terms of a timeline , röttgen said he believes a new government can be formed in october - assuming the chancellorship question is resolved .
after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .
2 , schröder has to quickly give up the notion of remaining chancellor , röttgen told berliner zeitung .
" we can do it if -lrb- chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder comes to his senses quickly , " he said .
the cdu 's müller told zdf : " -lrb- the spd -rrb- will simply not be able to continue as they have until now with the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister wolfgang clement on tuesday , economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of the spd 's chief negotiators , warned that setting conditions for the bi-partisan talks was counterproductive .
" i do n't think it 's wise to start the discussions by stating pre-conditions , " he said . as for cdu leader merkel , " she must accept that she is short of a majority in parliament with only 45 percent of the deputies supporting her , " clement said .
" these talks can only be successful if both sides agree that none has won the election and that both sides need to cooperate for the sake of a stable government .

this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .

" on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ?

and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .

but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .

" on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ?

and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .

" on average , people in the east are less successful , less productive and not as wealthy .
materially speaking , they 're less happy , " seemann said .
" but that 's exactly why cultural diversity in the eastern states plays a more important role than in the west .
people in eastern germany are aware that there are things which are more important than making money and paying taxes .
they see the arts as a creative process of ' togetherness . '

a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .
but what the governments sent eichel and what eastern germany 's most prominent economic institute found are miles apart . accusations of misappropriation brandenburg 's social democratic-conservative party coalition government , for example , said that it spent 89 percent of the 1.5 billion euros received last year on the reconstruction projects the money was intended for .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .

he was considered one of italy 's economic wonders of the 1970s and is accused of nearly driving the parmalat empire into the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former parmalat president calisto tanzi almost two years after a 14-billion-euro -lrb- $ 17-billion -rrb- hole was found in the company 's accounts - eight times more than reported in company record , the 66-year-old is to be tried along with 15 other people , including several company administrators .
he faces charges of false accounting and share price manipulation and could spend up to five years in jail if convicted . auditors also implicated two auditing companies - grant thornton , and deloitte and touche - and the italian subsidiary of bank of america have also been targeted by prosecutors and face the same charges . in his testimony , tanzi , who has not yet personally commented on the case , is expected to place the blame on the banks for covering up the scandal . the trial is to decide how much responsibility lay with tanzi and how much with the others in reports of false information to financial markets that swallowed the savings of about 135,000 investors in italy .

they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .
they can still take part .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german east accused of misappropriation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where the money should go : a new autobahn in saxony-anhalt next week , east german states are required to tell finance minister hans eichel how they spent the billions of euros in subsidies the federal government transferred last year .
a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .
but what the governments sent eichel and what eastern germany 's most prominent economic institute found are miles apart . accusations of misappropriation brandenburg 's social democratic-conservative party coalition government , for example , said that it spent 89 percent of the 1.5 billion euros received last year on the reconstruction projects the money was intended for .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .
" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .
" if i pay a teacher , is that not an investment ? " rainer speer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel wo n't be happy the report is not likely to please eichel , who on monday faced renewed pressure from the european union to bring germany 's debt to below 3 percent of total gross domestic product , a stipulation of the stability and growth pace intended to control spending in the 12 euro-zone countries .
in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .
under current terms , the pact calls for the transfer of up to 156 billion euros to the east until 2019 . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report highlights eastern german economic successes though it has chronic unemployment and has struggled to gain a foothold in the post-reunification era , eastern germany is n't as doom and gloom as it may seem .

the color will be pink - typically atypical for the austrian architect . the city 's leaders , looking with great hope for something to revive the town that is languishing in the economic doldrums , are ready to present the house to the public on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim .

these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .

moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .

after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .

" we all want to help the national team , but at the moment jürgen klinsmann is not letting us . "
the kaiser also added that while some changes in the lineup are to be expected , " klinsmann eventually has to find his formation " and that the current setup is " not optimal . "
günter netzer , a former national team player and current soccer commentator , agreed with beckenbauer that " the team should be coming together . "

this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .

" on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .

hurricane katrina alone , which devastated large areas in the south of the united states in august , was expected to burden munich re 's after-tax profit by around 500 million euros and as much as 1.1 billion euros before tax , the company said in a statement .
hurricane rita was expected to result in a net loss burden of 150 million euros for the world 's largest reinsurer and a burden of 230 million euros before tax .
" as the full extent of the devastation caused by hurricane katrina has gradually emerged , natural catastrophe risk management specialists and other companies have revised their loss estimates upwards , " munich re said .
all in all , the two hurricanes were estimated to have lead to total insured market losses of up to $ 40 billion , munich re calculated .
with regard to the group 's own earnings targets for the current year , munich re said it remained optimistic that it would still be able to achieve its target of net return on equity of 12 percent in 2005 . dw-world.de predicting storms before they strike in the shadow of hurricane katrina , a team of german and british scientists are developing tools to detect early warning signs of storms by studying what triggers them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification german east accused of misappropriation culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.09.2005 reunification 's cultural challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite their differences the two germanies shared a cultural base politically and economically speaking , the two german states couldn ’ t have been more different after 40 years of separation .
but the common cultural tradition was considered the basis for one nation . " we are the people ! " was the political slogan east germans shouted when they fought for freedom under a communist regime .
it turned into " we are one people ! " when bavarian conservatives joined their ranks at the infamous monday demonstrations in leipzig .
not much later , the berlin wall fell .
on oct .
3 , 1990 , germany reunited . since then , the two germanys have been getting to know each other better and coming to a better understanding of their differences .
the art world , as one example , is still learning about the preferences of art buyers in east and west . eastern german art gallerist gerd-harry lybcke is credited with discovering the so-called " leipzig school " of artists working in the eastern germany city who , years after the fall of the wall , revived a style of literal realism that fell out of favor in west germany in the 1970s and ' 80s . paintings in this style are a hot commodity on the international art scene , but lybcke , who opened his gallery eigen + art in leipzig in 1986 , does n't sell works from the popular artists to collectors in germany 's east .
the economic upswing has still not happened there .
money is made elsewhere . the allure of the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " vorstadt , " christoph ruckhaeberle , 2002 despite the relative lack of wealth in the east , lybcke says excellent young artists come to leipzig from the west to study .
in the ' wild ' east , there is a certain inspiration for artistic expression lacking in the west . " they have experienced wealth where it feels so empty , " lybcke said .
" now , they come to a fairly poor state in the east and discover the cultural abundance here .
as an artist , you can discover yourself .
there 's so much that has n't been done .
you take responsibility for your artistic position .
being responsible for what you 're doing is an ideal situation to shape a character . " germany 's eastern states need to spend far more money on the arts than the western states in order to maintain the extensive artistic infrastructure built by the communist regime .
at the time of the fall of the wall , east germany had an impressive number of state-funded cultural institutions : 217 theaters , 87 symphony orchestras , 955 museums , more than 200 music schools , 9,349 libraries and 250,000 architectural and historical monuments . returning eastern cities to their former glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new palace in potsdam , one of east germany 's jewels gottfried kiesow , head of germany 's foundation for the protection of historical monuments , says germany paid almost $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- for cultural programs and architectural renovation in the first three years after unification . " east german cities were in a decrepit state , because so little was done to maintain buildings under the socialists , " kiesow explained .
" very few buildings were modernized .
most were poorly maintained .
but generally , historic buildings remained intact .
in the west , entire city centers were scarred by shopping malls and advertising .
in the east , town planners who did little made few mistakes , " he said . entire cities in the east needed to be renovated after the wall came down , but fortunately the historic substance was never lost .
in the past 15 years , the cultural centers of weimar , potsdam , leipzig , dresden and görlitz have blossomed . palaces , castles and townhouses , theaters , memorials and museums have been restored at great expense .
today , they again demonstrate the heights of a germany 's common cultural tradition in the 18th and 19th centuries .
they have become places of national identity - and lucrative tourist destinations . the arts as a catalyst for cultural reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schiller museum in weimar , a german cultural treasure hellmut seemann , president of the weimar classic foundation , believes the arts can play an important role in the continuing process of cultural unification .
" on average , people in the east are less successful , less productive and not as wealthy .
materially speaking , they 're less happy , " seemann said .
" but that 's exactly why cultural diversity in the eastern states plays a more important role than in the west .
people in eastern germany are aware that there are things which are more important than making money and paying taxes .
they see the arts as a creative process of ' togetherness . '
we need to strengthen this consciousness , because that 's the only way to ensure culture and society continues to thrive - regardless of where we stand economically in the years to come .

a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .
but what the governments sent eichel and what eastern germany 's most prominent economic institute found are miles apart . accusations of misappropriation brandenburg 's social democratic-conservative party coalition government , for example , said that it spent 89 percent of the 1.5 billion euros received last year on the reconstruction projects the money was intended for .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .
" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .
" if i pay a teacher , is that not an investment ? " rainer speer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel wo n't be happy the report is not likely to please eichel , who on monday faced renewed pressure from the european union to bring germany 's debt to below 3 percent of total gross domestic product , a stipulation of the stability and growth pace intended to control spending in the 12 euro-zone countries .
in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .
under current terms , the pact calls for the transfer of up to 156 billion euros to the east until 2019 . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report highlights eastern german economic successes though it has chronic unemployment and has struggled to gain a foothold in the post-reunification era , eastern germany is n't as doom and gloom as it may seem .

" the election battle and the clashes in the run-up to the german elections on the one hand and the hike in oil prices on the other have further impacted on the consumer mood in germany , " market research group gfk said in a statement .
for its monthly poll , gfk quizzes around 2,000 consumers on their views on the economic outlook , income expectations and their propensity to buy .
the responses are then used to calculate an overall consumer climate index , which is set to fall slightly to 3.1 points in october from a revised figure of 3.3 points in september , gfk forecast .
" the outcome of the german elections is expected to be followed by extremely complicated and possibly lengthy negotiations on creating a stable government , " the gfk said .
neither the social democratic party or the conservative christian union parties secured enough votes for a ruling majority .
persistently sluggish consumer demand has been the main reason why the german economy has been unable to stage a lasting recovery . dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks the cdu / csu and spd parties outlined their talking points as they headed into more talks over the possible formation of a coalition government wednesday .
but they still disagree on the leadership question .

but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor . visibly tired , but satisfied , representatives of germany 's two major parties appeared before cameras wednesday night after a long day of talks they said focused on the economic challenges facing germany .
chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim . " talking points spd general secretary klaus uwe benneter stessed in an interview with zdf public telelvision ahead of the talks that his party would stick behind chancellor schröder .
but cdu steering committee member hildegard müller insisted that as the strongest party , the union should - and would - lead the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , schröder meanwhile , norbert röttgen , parliamentary spokesman for the conservative christian democratic union , told the berliner zeitung on wednesday that there are four major challenges facing a grand coalition government .
these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .
speaking to zdf , the spd 's benneter agreed these points will also be addressed in the exploratory talks .
moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .
but he reiterated that the main objective is to form a stable government .
cdu seeks change in terms of a timeline , röttgen said he believes a new government can be formed in october - assuming the chancellorship question is resolved .
after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .
2 , schröder has to quickly give up the notion of remaining chancellor , röttgen told berliner zeitung .
" we can do it if -lrb- chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder comes to his senses quickly , " he said .
the cdu 's müller told zdf : " -lrb- the spd -rrb- will simply not be able to continue as they have until now with the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister wolfgang clement on tuesday , economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of the spd 's chief negotiators , warned that setting conditions for the bi-partisan talks was counterproductive .
" i do n't think it 's wise to start the discussions by stating pre-conditions , " he said . as for cdu leader merkel , " she must accept that she is short of a majority in parliament with only 45 percent of the deputies supporting her , " clement said .
" these talks can only be successful if both sides agree that none has won the election and that both sides need to cooperate for the sake of a stable government .

chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim . " talking points spd general secretary klaus uwe benneter stessed in an interview with zdf public telelvision ahead of the talks that his party would stick behind chancellor schröder .
but cdu steering committee member hildegard müller insisted that as the strongest party , the union should - and would - lead the government .

these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .
speaking to zdf , the spd 's benneter agreed these points will also be addressed in the exploratory talks .
moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .
but he reiterated that the main objective is to form a stable government .
cdu seeks change in terms of a timeline , röttgen said he believes a new government can be formed in october - assuming the chancellorship question is resolved .
after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .
2 , schröder has to quickly give up the notion of remaining chancellor , röttgen told berliner zeitung .
" we can do it if -lrb- chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder comes to his senses quickly , " he said .
the cdu 's müller told zdf : " -lrb- the spd -rrb- will simply not be able to continue as they have until now with the union . "

but the extra soldiers in the area will not be able to resolve afghanistan 's difficulties . there are two faces to the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan .
one is of german soldiers walking patrols and watching over the country 's first parliamentary election in 36 years as smiling children wave to them .
the other shows the faces of the 17 german soldiers killed while serving in afghanistan in the past three and a half years . much of country still unsafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are unable to protect all of afghanistan there are many parts of the country where not even the armed soldiers of the nato-led international security assistance force fear to tread .
it is a long and dangerous process to move forward in a country where it 's impossible to get an overview of who is in control where . taliban supporters , drug barons and local warlords all want to get rid of the foreign troops - a fact they prove with their regular attacks on isaf and the 20,000 additional us troops stationed in afghanistan . the situation in afghanistan is so complicated that there are in fact two mandates from the german parliament for the soldiers it sends .
two mandates for a country with two faces : the one that was extended wednesday for security troops and another for the fight against terrorism , that will be up for debate again in november .
and it does n't look like either one of them will be ending soon as the tasks for german troops are piling up . soldiers ca n't guarantee peace in addition to the extra troops , the bundeswehr will be taking over nato 's responsibility for the entire northern part of the country .
but that is by no means a guarantee for a lasting peace in the region .
the north is where that the drug trade is flourishing , and the new mandate will not take any steps against it , as the troops would certainly be overextended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither soldiers not government officials are able to destroy the opium-producing poppy fields despite its promises to double its efforts , the afghan government is still unable to counteract the drug barons .
the situation does n't seem to have an answer and sooner or later the drug issue will lead to massive problems - and soldiers wo n't be able to disentangle this mess either . economic roadmap needed the international troops are doing an indispensable service in promoting safety and stability in afghanistan , but they are not a cure for every ailment .
now that afghans have elected a president and parliament and enacted a constitution , they will have to set up a time plan for the how the country will move itself forward economically without additional income from illegal opium sales . otherwise isaf can continue to prolong its presence for the next 20 years without addressing afghanistan 's actual problems . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .

bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deploying more troops wo n't bring stability to the region any faster the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems . in conjunction with the prolonged mandate for german troops in afghanistan , which was approved by the german parliament in a 535-15 vote , is a measure that calls for 750 more soldiers to join the 2,250 already stationed there .
but the extra soldiers in the area will not be able to resolve afghanistan 's difficulties . there are two faces to the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan .
one is of german soldiers walking patrols and watching over the country 's first parliamentary election in 36 years as smiling children wave to them .
the other shows the faces of the 17 german soldiers killed while serving in afghanistan in the past three and a half years . much of country still unsafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are unable to protect all of afghanistan there are many parts of the country where not even the armed soldiers of the nato-led international security assistance force fear to tread .
it is a long and dangerous process to move forward in a country where it 's impossible to get an overview of who is in control where . taliban supporters , drug barons and local warlords all want to get rid of the foreign troops - a fact they prove with their regular attacks on isaf and the 20,000 additional us troops stationed in afghanistan . the situation in afghanistan is so complicated that there are in fact two mandates from the german parliament for the soldiers it sends .
two mandates for a country with two faces : the one that was extended wednesday for security troops and another for the fight against terrorism , that will be up for debate again in november .
and it does n't look like either one of them will be ending soon as the tasks for german troops are piling up . soldiers ca n't guarantee peace in addition to the extra troops , the bundeswehr will be taking over nato 's responsibility for the entire northern part of the country .
but that is by no means a guarantee for a lasting peace in the region .
the north is where that the drug trade is flourishing , and the new mandate will not take any steps against it , as the troops would certainly be overextended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither soldiers not government officials are able to destroy the opium-producing poppy fields despite its promises to double its efforts , the afghan government is still unable to counteract the drug barons .
the situation does n't seem to have an answer and sooner or later the drug issue will lead to massive problems - and soldiers wo n't be able to disentangle this mess either . economic roadmap needed the international troops are doing an indispensable service in promoting safety and stability in afghanistan , but they are not a cure for every ailment .
now that afghans have elected a president and parliament and enacted a constitution , they will have to set up a time plan for the how the country will move itself forward economically without additional income from illegal opium sales . otherwise isaf can continue to prolong its presence for the next 20 years without addressing afghanistan 's actual problems . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

" this -lrb- the bathroom -rrb- does n't have anything to with hundertwasser , that 's ' kitsch ' , " harel told the local newspaper magdeburger volksstimme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " green citadel " in magdeburg clearly reveals the playful nature of hundertwasser harel might have a point .
after all , hundertwasser did n't shy away from projects where people are most shy , one of the most well-known being the kawakawa public toilet in new zealand .
in magdeburg , business leaders are more pragmatic . " the public toilet 's tenant has the last word , " said ute siebrecht of the marketing association centrum aqua . murder on the roof more visible on the roof are some 9,000 bushes .
harel would like to see these removed also because they look too much like a garden .
in other words , the human touch is too present .
he would prefer that a meadow of wild flowers be planted . removing the shrubs with a value of over 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- would raise rent prices excessively according to centrum aqua .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.09.2005 pimp my reunification ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half golf , half trabant : more than just franken-fun ?
just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

the color will be pink - typically atypical for the austrian architect . the city 's leaders , looking with great hope for something to revive the town that is languishing in the economic doldrums , are ready to present the house to the public on oct .

" this -lrb- the bathroom -rrb- does n't have anything to with hundertwasser , that 's ' kitsch ' , " harel told the local newspaper magdeburger volksstimme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " green citadel " in magdeburg clearly reveals the playful nature of hundertwasser harel might have a point .
after all , hundertwasser did n't shy away from projects where people are most shy , one of the most well-known being the kawakawa public toilet in new zealand .
in magdeburg , business leaders are more pragmatic . " the public toilet 's tenant has the last word , " said ute siebrecht of the marketing association centrum aqua . murder on the roof more visible on the roof are some 9,000 bushes .
harel would like to see these removed also because they look too much like a garden .
in other words , the human touch is too present .
he would prefer that a meadow of wild flowers be planted . removing the shrubs with a value of over 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- would raise rent prices excessively according to centrum aqua .

at the time of the fall of the wall , east germany had an impressive number of state-funded cultural institutions : 217 theaters , 87 symphony orchestras , 955 museums , more than 200 music schools , 9,349 libraries and 250,000 architectural and historical monuments . returning eastern cities to their former glory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new palace in potsdam , one of east germany 's jewels gottfried kiesow , head of germany 's foundation for the protection of historical monuments , says germany paid almost $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- for cultural programs and architectural renovation in the first three years after unification . " east german cities were in a decrepit state , because so little was done to maintain buildings under the socialists , " kiesow explained .
" very few buildings were modernized .
most were poorly maintained .
but generally , historic buildings remained intact .
in the west , entire city centers were scarred by shopping malls and advertising .
in the east , town planners who did little made few mistakes , " he said . entire cities in the east needed to be renovated after the wall came down , but fortunately the historic substance was never lost .
in the past 15 years , the cultural centers of weimar , potsdam , leipzig , dresden and görlitz have blossomed . palaces , castles and townhouses , theaters , memorials and museums have been restored at great expense .
today , they again demonstrate the heights of a germany 's common cultural tradition in the 18th and 19th centuries .
they have become places of national identity - and lucrative tourist destinations . the arts as a catalyst for cultural reunification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schiller museum in weimar , a german cultural treasure hellmut seemann , president of the weimar classic foundation , believes the arts can play an important role in the continuing process of cultural unification .
" on average , people in the east are less successful , less productive and not as wealthy .
materially speaking , they 're less happy , " seemann said .
" but that 's exactly why cultural diversity in the eastern states plays a more important role than in the west .
people in eastern germany are aware that there are things which are more important than making money and paying taxes .
they see the arts as a creative process of ' togetherness . '
we need to strengthen this consciousness , because that 's the only way to ensure culture and society continues to thrive - regardless of where we stand economically in the years to come . " peter zimmermann -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german reunification model not for seoul robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification .

while greece and italy have so far laid claim to europe 's oldest civilizations , germany 's struggling eastern regions seem set to challenge this .

the color will be pink - typically atypical for the austrian architect . the city 's leaders , looking with great hope for something to revive the town that is languishing in the economic doldrums , are ready to present the house to the public on oct .

" this -lrb- the bathroom -rrb- does n't have anything to with hundertwasser , that 's ' kitsch ' , " harel told the local newspaper magdeburger volksstimme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " green citadel " in magdeburg clearly reveals the playful nature of hundertwasser harel might have a point .
after all , hundertwasser did n't shy away from projects where people are most shy , one of the most well-known being the kawakawa public toilet in new zealand .
in magdeburg , business leaders are more pragmatic . " the public toilet 's tenant has the last word , " said ute siebrecht of the marketing association centrum aqua . murder on the roof more visible on the roof are some 9,000 bushes .
harel would like to see these removed also because they look too much like a garden .
in other words , the human touch is too present .
he would prefer that a meadow of wild flowers be planted . removing the shrubs with a value of over 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- would raise rent prices excessively according to centrum aqua .

but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .

two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .

the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "

" the election battle and the clashes in the run-up to the german elections on the one hand and the hike in oil prices on the other have further impacted on the consumer mood in germany , " market research group gfk said in a statement .
for its monthly poll , gfk quizzes around 2,000 consumers on their views on the economic outlook , income expectations and their propensity to buy .
the responses are then used to calculate an overall consumer climate index , which is set to fall slightly to 3.1 points in october from a revised figure of 3.3 points in september , gfk forecast .
" the outcome of the german elections is expected to be followed by extremely complicated and possibly lengthy negotiations on creating a stable government , " the gfk said .
neither the social democratic party or the conservative christian union parties secured enough votes for a ruling majority .
persistently sluggish consumer demand has been the main reason why the german economy has been unable to stage a lasting recovery . dw-world.de both major parties pleased with talks the cdu / csu and spd parties outlined their talking points as they headed into more talks over the possible formation of a coalition government wednesday .
but they still disagree on the leadership question .

the announcment confirms speculation that had been circling over the past week that mercedes planned to reduce its german workforce of 94,000 in order to cut costs .

cuts via attrition jobs would be cut via so-called attrition or " natural wastage , " where people leaving the company would not be replaced , since the german mercedes employees are protected by an agreement of no compulsory redundancies until 2012 .

an official ceremony handing the facility over to german authorities will take place oct .

known as the " gateway to europe , " rhine-main , which at one time was the largest airbase outside the us and supported some 3,000 military and civilian employees , was in operation since the end of world war ii and used as a major hub for deployment of us forces to afghanistan and iraq .
the closure is part of us plans to move strategic airlift capability to ramstein and spangdahlem airbases in the western german state of rhineland-palatinate , where about 405 million euros -lrb- $ 487 million -rrb- were spent on renovations to these two facilities .
the move also fits in with the us strategy of replacing cold war-era bases in western europe with a network of logistics hubs , smaller bases , and lightly manned operating locations .
in 1999 , us air force and german authorities agreed to close the base and return it to germany by dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.09.2005 pimp my reunification ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half golf , half trabant : more than just franken-fun ?
just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor . visibly tired , but satisfied , representatives of germany 's two major parties appeared before cameras wednesday night after a long day of talks they said focused on the economic challenges facing germany .
chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim . " talking points spd general secretary klaus uwe benneter stessed in an interview with zdf public telelvision ahead of the talks that his party would stick behind chancellor schröder .

these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .
speaking to zdf , the spd 's benneter agreed these points will also be addressed in the exploratory talks .
moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .
but he reiterated that the main objective is to form a stable government .
cdu seeks change in terms of a timeline , röttgen said he believes a new government can be formed in october - assuming the chancellorship question is resolved .
after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .
2 , schröder has to quickly give up the notion of remaining chancellor , röttgen told berliner zeitung .
" we can do it if -lrb- chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder comes to his senses quickly , " he said .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

a united nations effort in 2004 to start reunification talks failed and there has been little movement since . ankara not intimidated cyprus could trip up turkey at any of the 35 stages of the accession process by using its veto power as a member of the eu .
but the government in ankara has been adamant in proving it is not intimidated .
turkey has so far refused to allow cypriot ships and planes into its ports and airports , though it agreed to a customs accord granting the ten new member states of the eu access .
to urge turkey on , the eu parliament on wednesday delayed a vote approving the customs union agreement , called the ankara protocol . the delay was demanded by the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest party in the eu parliament , due to ankara 's refusal to let cypriot ships and planes use its ports and airports , as required under the extended customs deal . vote delay wo n't block talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- lamented the postponement , saying it amounted to an " own goal , " by the parliament , said his spokeswoman , pia ahrenkilde hansen . but she added the delay can not block the start of talks next week . " it is not condition for opening accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 , " hansen said . also nonbinding , but a diplomatic slap in the face , is the parliament 's resolution that turkey recognize the killing of millions of armenians in 1915 in the ottoman empire as genocide , something the country has repeatedly refused to do . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu reaches deal on turkey-cyprus tangle two weeks before accession talks with turkey are set to start , brussels reached a diplomatic breakthrough on ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member state cyprus .

the announcment confirms speculation that had been circling over the past week that mercedes planned to reduce its german workforce of 94,000 in order to cut costs .

cuts via attrition jobs would be cut via so-called attrition or " natural wastage , " where people leaving the company would not be replaced , since the german mercedes employees are protected by an agreement of no compulsory redundancies until 2012 .

past agreements in july 2004 , daimler workers in germany agreed to forego wage increases in exchange for securing 6000 production jobs in the mercedes plant at sindelfingen .
in turn , daimlerchrysler promised to halt layoffs until 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

" but that 's exactly why cultural diversity in the eastern states plays a more important role than in the west .
people in eastern germany are aware that there are things which are more important than making money and paying taxes .
they see the arts as a creative process of ' togetherness . '

the color will be pink - typically atypical for the austrian architect . the city 's leaders , looking with great hope for something to revive the town that is languishing in the economic doldrums , are ready to present the house to the public on oct .

" this -lrb- the bathroom -rrb- does n't have anything to with hundertwasser , that 's ' kitsch ' , " harel told the local newspaper magdeburger volksstimme . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " green citadel " in magdeburg clearly reveals the playful nature of hundertwasser harel might have a point .
after all , hundertwasser did n't shy away from projects where people are most shy , one of the most well-known being the kawakawa public toilet in new zealand .
in magdeburg , business leaders are more pragmatic . " the public toilet 's tenant has the last word , " said ute siebrecht of the marketing association centrum aqua . murder on the roof more visible on the roof are some 9,000 bushes .
harel would like to see these removed also because they look too much like a garden .
in other words , the human touch is too present .
he would prefer that a meadow of wild flowers be planted . removing the shrubs with a value of over 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- would raise rent prices excessively according to centrum aqua .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2005 stores get creative to lure business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while parents shop , the kids can play - or carve pumpkins german retail has been suffering for years now , but more and more shopkeepers are finding new ways to bring customers through their doors - and keep them there . dinger 's garden center in cologne is like any other large nursery , with row after row of seedlings , bushes and flowers lining light-filled hothouses .
but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .
they can still take part .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .
but what the governments sent eichel and what eastern germany 's most prominent economic institute found are miles apart . accusations of misappropriation brandenburg 's social democratic-conservative party coalition government , for example , said that it spent 89 percent of the 1.5 billion euros received last year on the reconstruction projects the money was intended for .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .
" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .
" if i pay a teacher , is that not an investment ? " rainer speer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel wo n't be happy the report is not likely to please eichel , who on monday faced renewed pressure from the european union to bring germany 's debt to below 3 percent of total gross domestic product , a stipulation of the stability and growth pace intended to control spending in the 12 euro-zone countries .
in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .
under current terms , the pact calls for the transfer of up to 156 billion euros to the east until 2019 . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report highlights eastern german economic successes though it has chronic unemployment and has struggled to gain a foothold in the post-reunification era , eastern germany is n't as doom and gloom as it may seem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.09.2005 pimp my reunification ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half golf , half trabant : more than just franken-fun ?
just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deploying more troops wo n't bring stability to the region any faster the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems . in conjunction with the prolonged mandate for german troops in afghanistan , which was approved by the german parliament in a 535-15 vote , is a measure that calls for 750 more soldiers to join the 2,250 already stationed there .
but the extra soldiers in the area will not be able to resolve afghanistan 's difficulties . there are two faces to the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan .
one is of german soldiers walking patrols and watching over the country 's first parliamentary election in 36 years as smiling children wave to them .
the other shows the faces of the 17 german soldiers killed while serving in afghanistan in the past three and a half years . much of country still unsafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are unable to protect all of afghanistan there are many parts of the country where not even the armed soldiers of the nato-led international security assistance force fear to tread .
it is a long and dangerous process to move forward in a country where it 's impossible to get an overview of who is in control where . taliban supporters , drug barons and local warlords all want to get rid of the foreign troops - a fact they prove with their regular attacks on isaf and the 20,000 additional us troops stationed in afghanistan . the situation in afghanistan is so complicated that there are in fact two mandates from the german parliament for the soldiers it sends .
two mandates for a country with two faces : the one that was extended wednesday for security troops and another for the fight against terrorism , that will be up for debate again in november .
and it does n't look like either one of them will be ending soon as the tasks for german troops are piling up . soldiers ca n't guarantee peace in addition to the extra troops , the bundeswehr will be taking over nato 's responsibility for the entire northern part of the country .
but that is by no means a guarantee for a lasting peace in the region .
the north is where that the drug trade is flourishing , and the new mandate will not take any steps against it , as the troops would certainly be overextended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither soldiers not government officials are able to destroy the opium-producing poppy fields despite its promises to double its efforts , the afghan government is still unable to counteract the drug barons .
the situation does n't seem to have an answer and sooner or later the drug issue will lead to massive problems - and soldiers wo n't be able to disentangle this mess either . economic roadmap needed the international troops are doing an indispensable service in promoting safety and stability in afghanistan , but they are not a cure for every ailment .
now that afghans have elected a president and parliament and enacted a constitution , they will have to set up a time plan for the how the country will move itself forward economically without additional income from illegal opium sales . otherwise isaf can continue to prolong its presence for the next 20 years without addressing afghanistan 's actual problems . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .
the us downplayed a report it is mulling a sharp reduction in its own troops there .

a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .
but what the governments sent eichel and what eastern germany 's most prominent economic institute found are miles apart . accusations of misappropriation brandenburg 's social democratic-conservative party coalition government , for example , said that it spent 89 percent of the 1.5 billion euros received last year on the reconstruction projects the money was intended for .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .
" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .
" if i pay a teacher , is that not an investment ? " rainer speer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel wo n't be happy the report is not likely to please eichel , who on monday faced renewed pressure from the european union to bring germany 's debt to below 3 percent of total gross domestic product , a stipulation of the stability and growth pace intended to control spending in the 12 euro-zone countries .
in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deploying more troops wo n't bring stability to the region any faster the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems . in conjunction with the prolonged mandate for german troops in afghanistan , which was approved by the german parliament in a 535-15 vote , is a measure that calls for 750 more soldiers to join the 2,250 already stationed there .
but the extra soldiers in the area will not be able to resolve afghanistan 's difficulties . there are two faces to the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan .
one is of german soldiers walking patrols and watching over the country 's first parliamentary election in 36 years as smiling children wave to them .
the other shows the faces of the 17 german soldiers killed while serving in afghanistan in the past three and a half years . much of country still unsafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are unable to protect all of afghanistan there are many parts of the country where not even the armed soldiers of the nato-led international security assistance force fear to tread .
it is a long and dangerous process to move forward in a country where it 's impossible to get an overview of who is in control where . taliban supporters , drug barons and local warlords all want to get rid of the foreign troops - a fact they prove with their regular attacks on isaf and the 20,000 additional us troops stationed in afghanistan . the situation in afghanistan is so complicated that there are in fact two mandates from the german parliament for the soldiers it sends .
two mandates for a country with two faces : the one that was extended wednesday for security troops and another for the fight against terrorism , that will be up for debate again in november .
and it does n't look like either one of them will be ending soon as the tasks for german troops are piling up . soldiers ca n't guarantee peace in addition to the extra troops , the bundeswehr will be taking over nato 's responsibility for the entire northern part of the country .
but that is by no means a guarantee for a lasting peace in the region .
the north is where that the drug trade is flourishing , and the new mandate will not take any steps against it , as the troops would certainly be overextended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither soldiers not government officials are able to destroy the opium-producing poppy fields despite its promises to double its efforts , the afghan government is still unable to counteract the drug barons .
the situation does n't seem to have an answer and sooner or later the drug issue will lead to massive problems - and soldiers wo n't be able to disentangle this mess either . economic roadmap needed the international troops are doing an indispensable service in promoting safety and stability in afghanistan , but they are not a cure for every ailment .
now that afghans have elected a president and parliament and enacted a constitution , they will have to set up a time plan for the how the country will move itself forward economically without additional income from illegal opium sales . otherwise isaf can continue to prolong its presence for the next 20 years without addressing afghanistan 's actual problems . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .
the us downplayed a report it is mulling a sharp reduction in its own troops there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .
they can still take part .

change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .

but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

but the extra soldiers in the area will not be able to resolve afghanistan 's difficulties . there are two faces to the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan .
one is of german soldiers walking patrols and watching over the country 's first parliamentary election in 36 years as smiling children wave to them .
the other shows the faces of the 17 german soldiers killed while serving in afghanistan in the past three and a half years . much of country still unsafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are unable to protect all of afghanistan there are many parts of the country where not even the armed soldiers of the nato-led international security assistance force fear to tread .
it is a long and dangerous process to move forward in a country where it 's impossible to get an overview of who is in control where . taliban supporters , drug barons and local warlords all want to get rid of the foreign troops - a fact they prove with their regular attacks on isaf and the 20,000 additional us troops stationed in afghanistan . the situation in afghanistan is so complicated that there are in fact two mandates from the german parliament for the soldiers it sends .
two mandates for a country with two faces : the one that was extended wednesday for security troops and another for the fight against terrorism , that will be up for debate again in november .
and it does n't look like either one of them will be ending soon as the tasks for german troops are piling up . soldiers ca n't guarantee peace in addition to the extra troops , the bundeswehr will be taking over nato 's responsibility for the entire northern part of the country .
but that is by no means a guarantee for a lasting peace in the region .
the north is where that the drug trade is flourishing , and the new mandate will not take any steps against it , as the troops would certainly be overextended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither soldiers not government officials are able to destroy the opium-producing poppy fields despite its promises to double its efforts , the afghan government is still unable to counteract the drug barons .
the situation does n't seem to have an answer and sooner or later the drug issue will lead to massive problems - and soldiers wo n't be able to disentangle this mess either . economic roadmap needed the international troops are doing an indispensable service in promoting safety and stability in afghanistan , but they are not a cure for every ailment .
now that afghans have elected a president and parliament and enacted a constitution , they will have to set up a time plan for the how the country will move itself forward economically without additional income from illegal opium sales . otherwise isaf can continue to prolong its presence for the next 20 years without addressing afghanistan 's actual problems . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor . visibly tired , but satisfied , representatives of germany 's two major parties appeared before cameras wednesday night after a long day of talks they said focused on the economic challenges facing germany .
chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim . " talking points spd general secretary klaus uwe benneter stessed in an interview with zdf public telelvision ahead of the talks that his party would stick behind chancellor schröder .
but cdu steering committee member hildegard müller insisted that as the strongest party , the union should - and would - lead the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , schröder meanwhile , norbert röttgen , parliamentary spokesman for the conservative christian democratic union , told the berliner zeitung on wednesday that there are four major challenges facing a grand coalition government .
these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .
speaking to zdf , the spd 's benneter agreed these points will also be addressed in the exploratory talks .
moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .
but he reiterated that the main objective is to form a stable government .
cdu seeks change in terms of a timeline , röttgen said he believes a new government can be formed in october - assuming the chancellorship question is resolved .
after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .
2 , schröder has to quickly give up the notion of remaining chancellor , röttgen told berliner zeitung .
" we can do it if -lrb- chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder comes to his senses quickly , " he said .
the cdu 's müller told zdf : " -lrb- the spd -rrb- will simply not be able to continue as they have until now with the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister wolfgang clement on tuesday , economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of the spd 's chief negotiators , warned that setting conditions for the bi-partisan talks was counterproductive .
" i do n't think it 's wise to start the discussions by stating pre-conditions , " he said . as for cdu leader merkel , " she must accept that she is short of a majority in parliament with only 45 percent of the deputies supporting her , " clement said .
" these talks can only be successful if both sides agree that none has won the election and that both sides need to cooperate for the sake of a stable government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 28.09.2005 both major parties pleased with talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks , but no formal negotiations - yet both the social democratic and the conservative parties called wednesday 's talks " fruitful " and " serious " .
but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor . visibly tired , but satisfied , representatives of germany 's two major parties appeared before cameras wednesday night after a long day of talks they said focused on the economic challenges facing germany .
chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim . " talking points spd general secretary klaus uwe benneter stessed in an interview with zdf public telelvision ahead of the talks that his party would stick behind chancellor schröder .
but cdu steering committee member hildegard müller insisted that as the strongest party , the union should - and would - lead the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , schröder meanwhile , norbert röttgen , parliamentary spokesman for the conservative christian democratic union , told the berliner zeitung on wednesday that there are four major challenges facing a grand coalition government .
these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .
speaking to zdf , the spd 's benneter agreed these points will also be addressed in the exploratory talks .
moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .
but he reiterated that the main objective is to form a stable government .
cdu seeks change in terms of a timeline , röttgen said he believes a new government can be formed in october - assuming the chancellorship question is resolved .
after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .
2 , schröder has to quickly give up the notion of remaining chancellor , röttgen told berliner zeitung .
" we can do it if -lrb- chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder comes to his senses quickly , " he said .
the cdu 's müller told zdf : " -lrb- the spd -rrb- will simply not be able to continue as they have until now with the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister wolfgang clement on tuesday , economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of the spd 's chief negotiators , warned that setting conditions for the bi-partisan talks was counterproductive .
" i do n't think it 's wise to start the discussions by stating pre-conditions , " he said . as for cdu leader merkel , " she must accept that she is short of a majority in parliament with only 45 percent of the deputies supporting her , " clement said .
" these talks can only be successful if both sides agree that none has won the election and that both sides need to cooperate for the sake of a stable government .

but the extra soldiers in the area will not be able to resolve afghanistan 's difficulties . there are two faces to the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan .
one is of german soldiers walking patrols and watching over the country 's first parliamentary election in 36 years as smiling children wave to them .
the other shows the faces of the 17 german soldiers killed while serving in afghanistan in the past three and a half years . much of country still unsafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are unable to protect all of afghanistan there are many parts of the country where not even the armed soldiers of the nato-led international security assistance force fear to tread .
it is a long and dangerous process to move forward in a country where it 's impossible to get an overview of who is in control where . taliban supporters , drug barons and local warlords all want to get rid of the foreign troops - a fact they prove with their regular attacks on isaf and the 20,000 additional us troops stationed in afghanistan . the situation in afghanistan is so complicated that there are in fact two mandates from the german parliament for the soldiers it sends .
two mandates for a country with two faces : the one that was extended wednesday for security troops and another for the fight against terrorism , that will be up for debate again in november .
and it does n't look like either one of them will be ending soon as the tasks for german troops are piling up . soldiers ca n't guarantee peace in addition to the extra troops , the bundeswehr will be taking over nato 's responsibility for the entire northern part of the country .
but that is by no means a guarantee for a lasting peace in the region .
the north is where that the drug trade is flourishing , and the new mandate will not take any steps against it , as the troops would certainly be overextended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither soldiers not government officials are able to destroy the opium-producing poppy fields despite its promises to double its efforts , the afghan government is still unable to counteract the drug barons .
the situation does n't seem to have an answer and sooner or later the drug issue will lead to massive problems - and soldiers wo n't be able to disentangle this mess either . economic roadmap needed the international troops are doing an indispensable service in promoting safety and stability in afghanistan , but they are not a cure for every ailment .
now that afghans have elected a president and parliament and enacted a constitution , they will have to set up a time plan for the how the country will move itself forward economically without additional income from illegal opium sales . otherwise isaf can continue to prolong its presence for the next 20 years without addressing afghanistan 's actual problems . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .

the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .
" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .

in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .

a united nations effort in 2004 to start reunification talks failed and there has been little movement since . ankara not intimidated cyprus could trip up turkey at any of the 35 stages of the accession process by using its veto power as a member of the eu .
but the government in ankara has been adamant in proving it is not intimidated .
turkey has so far refused to allow cypriot ships and planes into its ports and airports , though it agreed to a customs accord granting the ten new member states of the eu access .
to urge turkey on , the eu parliament on wednesday delayed a vote approving the customs union agreement , called the ankara protocol . the delay was demanded by the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest party in the eu parliament , due to ankara 's refusal to let cypriot ships and planes use its ports and airports , as required under the extended customs deal . vote delay wo n't block talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- lamented the postponement , saying it amounted to an " own goal , " by the parliament , said his spokeswoman , pia ahrenkilde hansen . but she added the delay can not block the start of talks next week . " it is not condition for opening accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 , " hansen said . also nonbinding , but a diplomatic slap in the face , is the parliament 's resolution that turkey recognize the killing of millions of armenians in 1915 in the ottoman empire as genocide , something the country has repeatedly refused to do . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu reaches deal on turkey-cyprus tangle two weeks before accession talks with turkey are set to start , brussels reached a diplomatic breakthrough on ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member state cyprus .

but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .
they can still take part .

the announcment confirms speculation that had been circling over the past week that mercedes planned to reduce its german workforce of 94,000 in order to cut costs .

past agreements in july 2004 , daimler workers in germany agreed to forego wage increases in exchange for securing 6000 production jobs in the mercedes plant at sindelfingen .
in turn , daimlerchrysler promised to halt layoffs until 2012 .

but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .

but the extra soldiers in the area will not be able to resolve afghanistan 's difficulties . there are two faces to the bundeswehr deployment in afghanistan .
one is of german soldiers walking patrols and watching over the country 's first parliamentary election in 36 years as smiling children wave to them .
the other shows the faces of the 17 german soldiers killed while serving in afghanistan in the past three and a half years . much of country still unsafe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troops are unable to protect all of afghanistan there are many parts of the country where not even the armed soldiers of the nato-led international security assistance force fear to tread .
it is a long and dangerous process to move forward in a country where it 's impossible to get an overview of who is in control where . taliban supporters , drug barons and local warlords all want to get rid of the foreign troops - a fact they prove with their regular attacks on isaf and the 20,000 additional us troops stationed in afghanistan . the situation in afghanistan is so complicated that there are in fact two mandates from the german parliament for the soldiers it sends .
two mandates for a country with two faces : the one that was extended wednesday for security troops and another for the fight against terrorism , that will be up for debate again in november .
and it does n't look like either one of them will be ending soon as the tasks for german troops are piling up . soldiers ca n't guarantee peace in addition to the extra troops , the bundeswehr will be taking over nato 's responsibility for the entire northern part of the country .
but that is by no means a guarantee for a lasting peace in the region .
the north is where that the drug trade is flourishing , and the new mandate will not take any steps against it , as the troops would certainly be overextended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither soldiers not government officials are able to destroy the opium-producing poppy fields despite its promises to double its efforts , the afghan government is still unable to counteract the drug barons .
the situation does n't seem to have an answer and sooner or later the drug issue will lead to massive problems - and soldiers wo n't be able to disentangle this mess either . economic roadmap needed the international troops are doing an indispensable service in promoting safety and stability in afghanistan , but they are not a cure for every ailment .
now that afghans have elected a president and parliament and enacted a constitution , they will have to set up a time plan for the how the country will move itself forward economically without additional income from illegal opium sales . otherwise isaf can continue to prolong its presence for the next 20 years without addressing afghanistan 's actual problems . nina werkhäuser -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato close to expanding afghan force nato officials meeting in berlin voiced confidence wednesday that they can overcome differences over expanding forces in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2005 stores get creative to lure business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while parents shop , the kids can play - or carve pumpkins german retail has been suffering for years now , but more and more shopkeepers are finding new ways to bring customers through their doors - and keep them there . dinger 's garden center in cologne is like any other large nursery , with row after row of seedlings , bushes and flowers lining light-filled hothouses .
but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .
they can still take part .

the color will be pink - typically atypical for the austrian architect . the city 's leaders , looking with great hope for something to revive the town that is languishing in the economic doldrums , are ready to present the house to the public on oct .

after all , hundertwasser did n't shy away from projects where people are most shy , one of the most well-known being the kawakawa public toilet in new zealand .
in magdeburg , business leaders are more pragmatic . " the public toilet 's tenant has the last word , " said ute siebrecht of the marketing association centrum aqua . murder on the roof more visible on the roof are some 9,000 bushes .
harel would like to see these removed also because they look too much like a garden .
in other words , the human touch is too present .
he would prefer that a meadow of wild flowers be planted . removing the shrubs with a value of over 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- would raise rent prices excessively according to centrum aqua .

but the common cultural tradition was considered the basis for one nation . " we are the people ! " was the political slogan east germans shouted when they fought for freedom under a communist regime .
it turned into " we are one people ! " when bavarian conservatives joined their ranks at the infamous monday demonstrations in leipzig .
not much later , the berlin wall fell .
on oct .
3 , 1990 , germany reunited . since then , the two germanys have been getting to know each other better and coming to a better understanding of their differences .
the art world , as one example , is still learning about the preferences of art buyers in east and west . eastern german art gallerist gerd-harry lybcke is credited with discovering the so-called " leipzig school " of artists working in the eastern germany city who , years after the fall of the wall , revived a style of literal realism that fell out of favor in west germany in the 1970s and ' 80s . paintings in this style are a hot commodity on the international art scene , but lybcke , who opened his gallery eigen + art in leipzig in 1986 , does n't sell works from the popular artists to collectors in germany 's east .

but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor . visibly tired , but satisfied , representatives of germany 's two major parties appeared before cameras wednesday night after a long day of talks they said focused on the economic challenges facing germany .
chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .

these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .

people in eastern germany are aware that there are things which are more important than making money and paying taxes .

but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .

" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .

in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .

in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .

but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .

bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.09.2005 stores get creative to lure business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while parents shop , the kids can play - or carve pumpkins german retail has been suffering for years now , but more and more shopkeepers are finding new ways to bring customers through their doors - and keep them there . dinger 's garden center in cologne is like any other large nursery , with row after row of seedlings , bushes and flowers lining light-filled hothouses .
but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .
they can still take part .

but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .

the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .

in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .

under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .

but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor . visibly tired , but satisfied , representatives of germany 's two major parties appeared before cameras wednesday night after a long day of talks they said focused on the economic challenges facing germany .
chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim .

these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .
speaking to zdf , the spd 's benneter agreed these points will also be addressed in the exploratory talks .
moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .
but he reiterated that the main objective is to form a stable government .
cdu seeks change in terms of a timeline , röttgen said he believes a new government can be formed in october - assuming the chancellorship question is resolved .
after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .
2 , schröder has to quickly give up the notion of remaining chancellor , röttgen told berliner zeitung .
" we can do it if -lrb- chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder comes to his senses quickly , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.09.2005 german politicians ' turkey divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's approach is far apart from that of prime minister erdogan germany 's day of unification , oct .
3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past .

the announcment confirms speculation that had been circling over the past week that mercedes planned to reduce its german workforce of 94,000 in order to cut costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes assembly line in tuscaloosa , al , usa dieter zetsche , who took control of mercedes this month and is set to become chief executive of daimlerchrysler at the beginning of 2006 , outlined the plan to german-us auto maker 's supervisory board during a meeting in the u.s. on wednesday .
the stock market reacted positively to the speculation on wednesday , with daimlerchrysler shares jumping up by nearly 3 percent to 45.21 euros -lrb- us $ 54.27 -rrb- in morning trading at the frankfurt stock exchange .
cuts via attrition jobs would be cut via so-called attrition or " natural wastage , " where people leaving the company would not be replaced , since the german mercedes employees are protected by an agreement of no compulsory redundancies until 2012 .
the redundancy payments would knock around 100 million euros off of mercedes ' earnings , according to reports .

it was only two summers ago that weeks of negotiation led to wage accords , and the agreement that german jobs would be secured in the long term .
the company appears to be backing away from the agreement , however .
past agreements in july 2004 , daimler workers in germany agreed to forego wage increases in exchange for securing 6000 production jobs in the mercedes plant at sindelfingen .
in turn , daimlerchrysler promised to halt layoffs until 2012 .
daimlerchrysler had threatened to produce its new c-class car in bremen and south africa if workers did n't agree to cost 500 million euros per year in cost-cutting measures .

3 , celebrates togetherness and solidarity .
this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

this year , however , it also marks the beginning of eu accession talks with turkey , an issue that has had a divisive effect on german society . turkey 's possible membership in the european union has been one of europe , and germany 's , hottest debates in recent years . on oct . 3 , things get a bit more serious , as official membership negotiations begin between brussels and ankara . the question of whether turkey should be granted a full eu membership or the " privileged partnership " favored by merkel and her conservative allies in europe dominates german parliament discussion . and the confusion over germany 's future leadership certainly wo n't help things . during the short , and hard-fought german election campaign , politicians chose to leave the inflammatory issue out of stump speeches .
but the stance on the issue by germany 's major parties is anything but murky .
the outgoing social democratic - green party coalition that has ruled germany for the past seven years sees a turkish eu membership as a crucial bridge to the muslim world , while the christian union parties and their opposition partners , the free democratic party , think of it as an integration challenge too overwhelming for europe . schröder 's strategic bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a campaign issue , but turks know where schröder stands german chancellor gerhard schröder has been one of the most prominent crusaders in europe in favor of turkey 's eu membership .
in speech after speech , schröder has done his best to convince the skeptics of its importance for europe . " negotiations about the accession of this country will last 10 to 15 years , " schröder has said .
" the negotiating concept will allow that we eliminate migration to our job market .
it will allow for both sides to interrupt or call off the talks .
thus it is an appropriate instrument for reaching our goal without putting any eu country , including germany , in too difficult a position , " he said . the german government argues that it would be far more dangerous to ignore turkey .
by offering it the potential of full membership , schröder and allies argue , they will push turkey to continue along its reform path and get a chance to build a strategic bridge to the muslim world .
green party concerns " if we can manage to make the connection between non-fundamentalist islam and the values of the western enlightenment , then we will have an increase in security which is of extraordinary significance , " schröder said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former green party head claudia roth sees hurdles , but none that are too high former green party head claudia roth adds that turkish membership in the eu would force major improvements in turkey 's civil rights and human rights practices as well as its dealing with its own troubled past . " on paper we have passed really crucial packages of bills , but now it 's about concrete implementation , especially when it comes to ' zero tolerance for cruel and unusual punishment ' , " roth said . " we have to make sure that turkey will hold to its ban on torture and prosecute and punish potential or actual torturers . " but what the outgoing government thinks is by no means the majority opinion in germany , something chancellor-in-waiting angela merkel has used to justify her calls for " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . union : eu has too much to handle " we argue the rationale for motivation behind our objection -lrb- to full membership -rrb- foremost with the question : what can the existing eu accomplish in its current composition ? " has said . she continued , " we are 25 countries , with romania and bulgaria we will have two more .
and as far as that is concerned , we must face the central question of whether the integration power of the current eu is suffering .
i think that europe ca n't handle it at the moment , and so i support the option of a privileged partnership , " she said . the speaker of the csu parliamentary group for european issues in the bundestag , gerd müller , called the notion of expanding the eu while strengthening it at the same time a " grand illusion " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd müller " the deepening and the parallel widening of the eu is the grand illusion of the european union , " müller argued .
" you ca n't hope to ratify a european constitution , transfer major powers of national sovereignty of the eu states to brussels , and at the same time extend the borders of the eu to anatolia , to asia minor , " he said .
what about a grand coalition ? turkey will remain a controversial topic for debate , and could be a major strain on the likely grand coalition .
in general , the two largest german parties agree only that turkey will need to continue with reforms if negotiations are to continue .
but where the negotiations should lead will continue to divide german politicians and the electorate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey the european parliament wednesday backed the start of entry talks with turkey next week , but took a couple of diplomatic shots at the eu hopeful on human rights , religious freedom , and the armenian massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.09.2005 pimp my reunification ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half golf , half trabant : more than just franken-fun ?
just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

just ahead of the 15th anniversary of german reunification , motorheads decided to create a car symbolizing the marriage of east and west .
but can an unholy union turn out to be more than just the sum of its parts ? half vw golf ii , half trabant 601 , the reunification vehicle gobbi was the brainchild of an internet car market .
but is it an appropriate symbol of unity for a car-crazed nation , or a minotaur for the modern age ?
to make gobbi , two cars - the legendary trabi from the eastern town of zwickau with its plastic body and two-stroke engine and the vw from the western city of wolfsburg - were purchased over the internet , then cut down the middle and soldered together to make a new , if unusual , entity .
unequal parts gobbi may have been created in the name of unity , but workers could n't help commenting on their separate-but-unequal components .
" the band-saw went through the trabi like butter , " said jens schüren , who worked on the car .
" in 10 minutes we had hacked the car in two .
the golf was a bit tougher .
it took us three quarters of an hour to get through the central column . "
bildunterschrift : the work was done at motoraver werkstatt near hamburg , a garage whose usual business involves modifying cars by souping up engines or customizing paint jobs .
the golf was used to make the front half of gobbi , while the trabi got to take up the rear .
while the car was successfully soldered together , its completion begs the question : was it a commentary on the fact that the western states remain the country 's economic " motor " while the east still lags behind ?
technical considerations its makers say no , and point to practical considerations .
" technically it made better sense this way , " schüren said .
" the golf is 24 centimeters -lrb- 9.4 inches -rrb- wider than the trabi , and gobbi just looked better if the narrower part was at the back .
also , the used trabi they bought had a dented front end , while the golf had a ding in its rear . "
people more interested in politics than power shafts may want to know : is gobbi just a case of car freaks having some franken-fun , or does the thing actually function ?
" of course , it drives , " schüren said .
but like some other big experiments in unification , all the bugs have yet to be worked out .
for example , the car still has n't passed official inspection .
" getting it through inspection would have taken too much time and money , " he said .

a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .
but what the governments sent eichel and what eastern germany 's most prominent economic institute found are miles apart . accusations of misappropriation brandenburg 's social democratic-conservative party coalition government , for example , said that it spent 89 percent of the 1.5 billion euros received last year on the reconstruction projects the money was intended for .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .
" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .
" if i pay a teacher , is that not an investment ? " rainer speer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel wo n't be happy the report is not likely to please eichel , who on monday faced renewed pressure from the european union to bring germany 's debt to below 3 percent of total gross domestic product , a stipulation of the stability and growth pace intended to control spending in the 12 euro-zone countries .
in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .
under current terms , the pact calls for the transfer of up to 156 billion euros to the east until 2019 . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report highlights eastern german economic successes though it has chronic unemployment and has struggled to gain a foothold in the post-reunification era , eastern germany is n't as doom and gloom as it may seem .

but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .
they can still take part .

but one saturday a month , families visiting the store can do more than just shop for plants .
parents bring young children to the store to take part in workshops run by a local art school .
and while the kids are making potato-stamp pictures or carving pumpkins , the parents can shop in peace , or sit down in the in-house café and have a bite to eat .
dinger 's has been offering the arts-and-crafts days for the past three years , and the response has grown steadily , said hans berkhauer , the store 's buyer and event-management director .
creating memories ?
the management came up with the idea as a way of attracting young families to the store .
" just setting up a slide and a ball pit , or having a tv running some cartoon loop isn ’ t enough anymore , " berkhauer said .
in order to set itself apart from other places selling plants - large discounters or a nearby supermarket or hardware store - dinger 's adopted a different approach , berkhauer said .
" the commercial idea is to generate long-term clients .
hopefully in 30 or 40 years those kids will remember their nice saturdays at dinger 's and will want to come back . "
the nursery is just one example of an emerging trend of flexibility and creativity in germany ’ s traditionally stiff retail environment .
sure , bookstores have been hosting readings -lrb- with follow-up book signings -rrb- and expanding reading-friendly cafés for a while now .
but following trends already long underway in the united states and elsewhere in europe , german retailers are starting to get more creative with their offerings .
and the lines between shopping , leisure and culture are beginning to blur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , retailers are opening coffee bars and day spas on their premises , or hosting events - both to promote specific goods , or simply create a feel-good shopping environment .
change in bureaucracy the phenomenon is still overwhelmingly associated with high-end retail , according to armin busacker , a lawyer and manager at the german retail association hde .
two months ago , the laws changed , allowing retailers to sell food and drink on their premises without having to specifically obtain a food service license .
this has facilitated the trend toward adding a " lifestyle " component to retail shops , busacker said .
" i just had a call from a flower shop in stuttgart that wanted to add a café , they weren ’ t sure it was allowed , " busacker said .
" in germany the competition is really extreme , so retailers and small boutiques are trying to keep their clients by adding extra service . ...
it remains to be seen if it will help . "
busacker asserts shops in pedestrian zones in city centers are the most creative in their marketing , because they have to be . downtown areas are under heavy pressure from suburban shopping centers , which busacker calls " green belt " shopping .
they are often easier to access , and have the square footage to hold a larger assortment of goods .
bildunterschrift : apropos cöln concept store restaurant leisure-meets-retail " people come to downtown shopping districts to have an experience .
they want to be offered a glass of champagne or a coffee .
the stores have had to become creative - so they do wellness , fashion shows or poetry readings .
otherwise they ’ ll be left behind , " said busacker .
in cologne , a store called apropos cöln concept store has taken the leisure-meets-retail concept to an extreme .
the space , which garnered retail association hde ’ s store of the year award for 2005 , is modeled on ultra-exclusive , lifestyle-oriented retail venues like fred segal in los angeles .
under a concept it calls " fusion , " apropos cöln sells clothing , cosmetics and jewelry , housewares , music and books , but also has an art gallery , lounge , café , restaurant and day spa .
the idea to create the shop came about after space got tight at apropos cöln ’ s first venue , which focused purely on luxury clothing and cosmetics .
when a large downtown space became available , the owners began thinking of ways to fill it . with cosmetics selling well at the initial store , a spa seemed a natural step .
indeed , it is now one of the store ’ s top business areas , according to apropos cöln spokesman guido boehler .
" what makes -lrb- the concept store -rrb- different is that we aren ’ t committed to doing any one thing .
we can try out new ideas , new wares .
the slogan of the concept store is ' from converse to couture , ' and that sums it up , " boehler said .
" we will sell 60-euro running shoes , or a designer skirt for 2,000 euros . "
range of patrons the shop not only sells culture , it creates it , putting out its own fashion and lifestyle magazine and hosting rotating exhibits in an art gallery . the gallery is a pet project of the store ’ s two owners , daniel riedo and klaus ritzenhöfer , who " wanted to share their passion for art photography with the public , " said boehler .
but at the same time , the gallery also double as the home to apropos cöln 's housewares department .
customers get to look at art and buy imported french teas in one and the same place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , the store has attracted an unusually wide public .
" at a store that just sells high fashion , there is one price range : expensive , " boehlen said .
" at the concept store , someone young , who doesn ’ t have much money , might only buy a lipstick .
or just sit and drink a coffee .
they can still take part .

but added they were still not ready to formally negotiate , or decide on a chancellor . visibly tired , but satisfied , representatives of germany 's two major parties appeared before cameras wednesday night after a long day of talks they said focused on the economic challenges facing germany .
chancellor gerhard schöder and social democratic party leader franz müntefering told reporters they were happy with the day 's discussions , seen by some as a precursor to negotiations for a coalition govenrment of germany 's two largest parties .
schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim . " talking points spd general secretary klaus uwe benneter stessed in an interview with zdf public telelvision ahead of the talks that his party would stick behind chancellor schröder .
but cdu steering committee member hildegard müller insisted that as the strongest party , the union should - and would - lead the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , schröder meanwhile , norbert röttgen , parliamentary spokesman for the conservative christian democratic union , told the berliner zeitung on wednesday that there are four major challenges facing a grand coalition government .
these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .
speaking to zdf , the spd 's benneter agreed these points will also be addressed in the exploratory talks .
moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .
but he reiterated that the main objective is to form a stable government .
cdu seeks change in terms of a timeline , röttgen said he believes a new government can be formed in october - assuming the chancellorship question is resolved .
after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .
2 , schröder has to quickly give up the notion of remaining chancellor , röttgen told berliner zeitung .
" we can do it if -lrb- chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder comes to his senses quickly , " he said .
the cdu 's müller told zdf : " -lrb- the spd -rrb- will simply not be able to continue as they have until now with the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister wolfgang clement on tuesday , economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of the spd 's chief negotiators , warned that setting conditions for the bi-partisan talks was counterproductive .
" i do n't think it 's wise to start the discussions by stating pre-conditions , " he said . as for cdu leader merkel , " she must accept that she is short of a majority in parliament with only 45 percent of the deputies supporting her , " clement said .
" these talks can only be successful if both sides agree that none has won the election and that both sides need to cooperate for the sake of a stable government .

a united nations effort in 2004 to start reunification talks failed and there has been little movement since . ankara not intimidated cyprus could trip up turkey at any of the 35 stages of the accession process by using its veto power as a member of the eu .
but the government in ankara has been adamant in proving it is not intimidated .
turkey has so far refused to allow cypriot ships and planes into its ports and airports , though it agreed to a customs accord granting the ten new member states of the eu access .
to urge turkey on , the eu parliament on wednesday delayed a vote approving the customs union agreement , called the ankara protocol . the delay was demanded by the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , the biggest party in the eu parliament , due to ankara 's refusal to let cypriot ships and planes use its ports and airports , as required under the extended customs deal . vote delay wo n't block talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- lamented the postponement , saying it amounted to an " own goal , " by the parliament , said his spokeswoman , pia ahrenkilde hansen . but she added the delay can not block the start of talks next week .

a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .
but what the governments sent eichel and what eastern germany 's most prominent economic institute found are miles apart . accusations of misappropriation brandenburg 's social democratic-conservative party coalition government , for example , said that it spent 89 percent of the 1.5 billion euros received last year on the reconstruction projects the money was intended for .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .
" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .
" if i pay a teacher , is that not an investment ? " rainer speer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel wo n't be happy the report is not likely to please eichel , who on monday faced renewed pressure from the european union to bring germany 's debt to below 3 percent of total gross domestic product , a stipulation of the stability and growth pace intended to control spending in the 12 euro-zone countries .
in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .

schröder said the closed-door session focused on content , and not whether angela merkel would replace him should they form a so-called grand coalition .
" to discuss personnel questions during a phase like this is politically wrong , " schröder said .
the two sides agreed to continue talks , but not coalition negotiations , next wednesday .
with each week , the intensity of the campaign has seemed to ebb from germany 's leadership discussion , something merkel addressed in her asnwers to reporter 's questions . " i was pleasantly surprised that we were able to discuss the matters at hand , only 10 days after such a campaign , " she said . only edmund stoiber , head of the christian social union , mentioned the touchy question of who would lead germany .
though both sides said they did n't discuss it during the meetings , stoiber said he hoped " that the spd accepts mrs. merkel 's leadership claim . " talking points spd general secretary klaus uwe benneter stessed in an interview with zdf public telelvision ahead of the talks that his party would stick behind chancellor schröder .
but cdu steering committee member hildegard müller insisted that as the strongest party , the union should - and would - lead the government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , schröder meanwhile , norbert röttgen , parliamentary spokesman for the conservative christian democratic union , told the berliner zeitung on wednesday that there are four major challenges facing a grand coalition government .
these are reorganizing the budget , changing the structure of health care and nursing care insurance , tax reform , and federalism .
in addition , he cited " altering the relationship between the citizen and the state ; " in other words , reducing bureaucracy .
" a grand coalition can address unpleasant questions that have not been resolved by the policies of the last 15 years , " röttgen told the paper .
speaking to zdf , the spd 's benneter agreed these points will also be addressed in the exploratory talks .
moreover , he said , the spd wants to seek out common ground with the cdu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to achieve this , both parties should compare their election platforms , " and then we will see where we can successfully work together , " benneter said .
but he reiterated that the main objective is to form a stable government .
cdu seeks change in terms of a timeline , röttgen said he believes a new government can be formed in october - assuming the chancellorship question is resolved .
after a delayed vote is held in dresden on oct .
2 , schröder has to quickly give up the notion of remaining chancellor , röttgen told berliner zeitung .
" we can do it if -lrb- chancellor gerhard -rrb- schröder comes to his senses quickly , " he said .
the cdu 's müller told zdf : " -lrb- the spd -rrb- will simply not be able to continue as they have until now with the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economy minister wolfgang clement on tuesday , economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- , one of the spd 's chief negotiators , warned that setting conditions for the bi-partisan talks was counterproductive .
" i do n't think it 's wise to start the discussions by stating pre-conditions , " he said . as for cdu leader merkel , " she must accept that she is short of a majority in parliament with only 45 percent of the deputies supporting her , " clement said .
" these talks can only be successful if both sides agree that none has won the election and that both sides need to cooperate for the sake of a stable government .

a new study does not paint a pretty picture . one day after germany commemorates the reunification of east and west on monday , eichel is due to get mail from the six " new " german states receiving government subsidies since 1990 . in the envelopes , the status report on the 10.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- the federal government transferred in 2004 .
the money is specifically intended to shore up the eastern german infrastructure and bring the budgets of cities close to those of their counterparts in the west . overall , the government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros that , broadly speaking , aim to bring the east up to the level of the west since reunification . but after some spectacular failed investments , and a lack of strong evidence that the money has sparked economic success , the government required brandenburg , mecklenburg western pomerania , berlin , saxony , thuringia and saxony-anhalt to show that the so-called solidarity pact money was being used for the right purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds hang over the construction site of a chip factory in brandenburg that was never completed . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung got a hold of the reports ahead of time .
but what the governments sent eichel and what eastern germany 's most prominent economic institute found are miles apart . accusations of misappropriation brandenburg 's social democratic-conservative party coalition government , for example , said that it spent 89 percent of the 1.5 billion euros received last year on the reconstruction projects the money was intended for .
the halle institute for economic research -lrb- ihw -rrb- , on the other hand , said that only 59 percent was used to those ends . in saxony-anhalt , the government said 59 percent of the 1.7 billion was used for the intended purpose of reconstruction projects .
the ihw said the figure was closer to 12 percent . only saxony , which has done an impressive job of turning around its economic fortunes in recent years , was found to have given out its 2.8 billion euros for the right projects . reports say some states used the subsidies to fill budget holes , rather than investing directly in infrastructure projects . different interpretations of " investment " " the solidarity pact 's intention is failing , " joachim rangnitz , the head of the ihw , told süddeutsche .
" the funds should actually spark dynamic growth . " brandenburg 's finance minister responded icily to such accusations , telling the paper that the very word " investment " was n't being used in the proper context .
" if i pay a teacher , is that not an investment ? " rainer speer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel wo n't be happy the report is not likely to please eichel , who on monday faced renewed pressure from the european union to bring germany 's debt to below 3 percent of total gross domestic product , a stipulation of the stability and growth pace intended to control spending in the 12 euro-zone countries .
in march , eichel was able to successfully argue that germany be given special treatment the immense cost of reunification , and its strain on the public coffers . experts say it might be time to renegotiate the second so-called solidarity pact between eastern and western germany .
under current terms , the pact calls for the transfer of up to 156 billion euros to the east until 2019 . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : report highlights eastern german economic successes though it has chronic unemployment and has struggled to gain a foothold in the post-reunification era , eastern germany is n't as doom and gloom as it may seem .

japanese researchers took pictures of the elusive creature hunting 900m down , enveloping its prey by coiling its tentacles into a ball .
the images show giant squid , known as architeuthis , are more vigorous hunters than has been supposed .
the images , captured in the pacific ocean , appear in the journal proceedings of the royal society b. "
it was exciting to get a live architeuthis tentacle .
it was still functioning when we got it on the boat " tsunemi kubodera , national science museum documentary companies have invested millions of dollars trying to film adult giant squid in their natural environment .
these efforts have met with little success - though one team has managed to capture a juvenile on film .
japanese fishermen have taken snaps of an adult at the surface but , until now , no one had obtained images of the animal in its deep-sea hunting grounds .
slippery customer in their efforts to photograph the huge cephalopod , tsunemi kubodera and kyoichi mori have been using a camera and depth recorder attached to a long-line , which they lower into the sea from their research vessel .
below the camera , they suspend a weighted jig - a set of ganged hooks to snag the squid - along with a single japanese common squid as bait and an odour lure consisting of chopped-up shrimps .
at 0915 local time on 30 september 2004 , they struck lucky .
at a depth close to 1km in waters off japan 's ogasawara islands , an 8m-long architeuthis wrapped its long tentacles around the bait , snagging one of them on the jig .
kubodera and mori took more than 550 images of the giant squid as it made repeated attempts to detach itself .
the pictures show the squid spreading its arms , enveloping the long-line and swimming away in its efforts to struggle free .
finally , four hours and 13 minutes after it was first snagged , the attached tentacle broke off , allowing the squid to escape .
the researchers retrieved a 5.5m portion with the line .
severed appendage " it was exciting to get a live architeuthis tentacle .
it was still functioning when we got it on the boat , " dr kubodera told bbc news .
the large suckers repeatedly gripped the boat deck - and dr kubodera 's fingers when he prodded the severed appendage .
total length comparison scientists admit they know little about the largest of the squid " the grip was n't as strong as i expected ; it felt sticky , " he explained .
but while other researchers have suggested that architeuthis is a rather sluggish creature , the images show it is in fact an energetic predator .
dr steve o 'shea , of the auckland university of technology , new zealand , told the bbc news website that he was extremely pleased for the researchers .
kubodera , he said , had " ever-so-quietly been working away in the background on this for a number of years " .
and dr o 'shea , a world renowned expert on giant squid , added : " from the point of view of the public , who believe this squid is the largest , the meanest , most aggressive squid that we have - it is hugely significant . "
trawling threat the auckland-based researcher said now that the squid had been caught on camera , researchers could focus on other , lesser known squid species and on conservation .
bottom-trawling by fisheries is destroying squid egg masses on the seabed , dr o 'shea claimed .
evidence for this comes from an efficient squid predator - the sperm whale .
" five of the species of squid that were staple in the diet of the sperm whale are recognised in new zealand as threatened solely as a consequence of the effects of deep-sea bottom-trawling . "
" -lsb- sperm whales -rsb- are returning from the antarctic on their historic migratory route to one of the richest regions on earth in terms of squid diversity .
but the larder is bare and the poor things are washing up on the beaches here starved . "
the giant squid is by no means the largest known .
several other species , including the colossal squid mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni , are thought to grow larger .

patients voiced concerns in march about overcrowding and a lack of facilities at the current unit in carmarthen .
they claim little has been done since they were told a new £ 1.5m centre would open at west wales general hospital .
but health commission wales -lrb- hcw -rrb- said it was now tendering for the building work and the centre was expected to be completed within 12 months .
the current unit covers carmarthenshire and pembrokeshire but , because it is full , some patients have to travel to swansea instead .
doctors have seen some patients in a corridor due to a lack of space in the portable building in the hospital grounds .
former nurse and dialysis patient ken bisnath said : " the situation is getting worse . "
mr bisnath is also a patient representative on a project board established to oversee the new centre .
he added : " we first saw -lsb- former welsh health minister -rsb- jane hutt last october and it was supposed to be ready this year .
so far it 's only at the planning stage .
" they keep putting it off and , as far as i know , they have not yet got planning permission for it .
" the project team has chosen what equipment is going in it but there is just delay after delay . "
completion date hcw , which commissions dialysis services in wales , had said previously a larger centre was needed and would open in 2006 at the latest .
the welsh assembly government had committed £ 1.5m for the project .
a hcw spokesman said a project board made up of patients and health professionals had met regularly since july .
" the design team has advised the project board on matters relating to the development of planning , construction and tender specifications and the new unit is expected to be completed by september 2006 , " he added .
" the tender to identify a construction company to undertake the building of the facilities is currently underway .
" in the meantime , hcw is working with the service provider to continue to provide services at the current unit . "

patients voiced concerns in march about overcrowding and a lack of facilities at the current unit in carmarthen .
they claim little has been done since they were told a new £ 1.5m centre would open at west wales general hospital .
but health commission wales -lrb- hcw -rrb- said it was now tendering for the building work and the centre was expected to be completed within 12 months .
the current unit covers carmarthenshire and pembrokeshire but , because it is full , some patients have to travel to swansea instead .
doctors have seen some patients in a corridor due to a lack of space in the portable building in the hospital grounds .
former nurse and dialysis patient ken bisnath said : " the situation is getting worse . "
mr bisnath is also a patient representative on a project board established to oversee the new centre .
he added : " we first saw -lsb- former welsh health minister -rsb- jane hutt last october and it was supposed to be ready this year .
so far it 's only at the planning stage .
" they keep putting it off and , as far as i know , they have not yet got planning permission for it .
" the project team has chosen what equipment is going in it but there is just delay after delay . "
completion date hcw , which commissions dialysis services in wales , had said previously a larger centre was needed and would open in 2006 at the latest .
the welsh assembly government had committed £ 1.5m for the project .
a hcw spokesman said a project board made up of patients and health professionals had met regularly since july .
" the design team has advised the project board on matters relating to the development of planning , construction and tender specifications and the new unit is expected to be completed by september 2006 , " he added .
" the tender to identify a construction company to undertake the building of the facilities is currently underway .
" in the meantime , hcw is working with the service provider to continue to provide services at the current unit . "

the communicable disease surveillance centre -lrb- cdsc -rrb- said this was the first notable annual downturn in its four years of monitoring the superbug .
between april 2004 and march 2005 , 242 cases were recorded : this was 65 cases -lrb- 21 % -rrb- fewer than the previous year .
cdsc director dr brian smyth said it was encouraging , but stressed there was no room for complacency .
" it is very welcome to see a reduction in the overall number of cases and to witness this in hospitals throughout northern ireland , " he said .
" however , it remains a challenging task to sustain this trend over future years , and this must now form the focus of ongoing work . "
the reduction was down to the introduction of new and substantive infection-control measures within all hospitals , according to the report 's coordinator , consultant microbiologist dr tim wyatt .
' downward trend ' " the next objectives are to try and maintain this downward trend and to further develop the surveillance programme that we have put in place , " he added .
ten of the 12 hospital trusts recorded a decrease in the rate of mrsa isolation , the report said .
dr wyatt said the mrsa increase in two trusts was not a major cause for concern and did not mask the overall improving trend .
" because hospitals are treating patients with different and often complex illnesses , the proportion of people at higher risk from mrsa will always vary , " he said .
mrsa stands for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , but is shorthand for any strain of staphylococcus bacteria which is resistant to one or more conventional antibiotics .
we have produced a visitors ' policy , whereby we are encouraging people who are unwell not to come in to visit their sick relatives mary mcilroy mater hospital it is more common in hospitals as sick patients are more vulnerable to picking up infections .
also , conditions on wards , which involve lots of people living in close proximity , examined by doctors and nurses who have just touched other patients , are the perfect environment for the transmission of a variety of infections .
the report said there were 568 patient episodes of staphylococcus aureus -lrb- s. aureus -rrb- bacteraemia across all hospitals between april 2004 and march 2005 .
this was 109 -lrb- 16 % -rrb- fewer than the previous year .
s. aureus is a bacteria commonly carried on the skin and can occasionally lead to blood-stream infections , should it enter the body through skin or wound infections .
mary mcilroy , the senior infection control nurse at belfast 's mater hospital , said staff were working very hard to tackle the problem .
" we have really been concentrating on things like audits and training all of our staff , " she said .
" we have also been trying to introduce measures for the public , so that any visitors coming in are encouraged to wash their hands and also to take measures .

figures show 37 people died in fires in the strathclyde area in 2004/05 and 26 of those were house fires .
strathclyde fire and rescue said in a new report it was determined to slash the number of fire deaths and sever the link between house fires and alcohol .
the report said a typical strathclyde fire victim is a male smoker , aged 50 or over , who lives alone .
assistant chief officer keith macgillvray said it had become a nationwide problem .
the sfr report found that alcohol was the biggest contributory factor to fire deaths .
it also states that the " pernicious problem " of alcohol-related fire deaths had become " a nationwide blight " . "

" to help achieve this aim we are introducing home fire safety visits where operational firefighters will give free advice and fit smoke detectors . "
last year 87 % of fire victims in the strathclyde area had been drinking excessively or died as a result of someone else 's drinking .
the brigade 's awareness campaign has been supported by the area procurator fiscal for glasgow , who has to investigate all sudden deaths .
the brigade is linking with social work departments to identify those most at risk and offer them advice and free alarm fitting .
procurator fiscal catherine dyer said she hoped people would read the report and take advantage of its advice to help cut the number of lives affected by fire in the strathclyde area each year .
she added : " the impact on those who have lost loved ones in house fires is devastating . "

lestat , inspired by anne rice 's the vampire chronicles , is the inaugural production of warner bros theatre ventures , launched in may 2003 to exploit the many library titles and characters owned by the studio .
the film studio warner bros is developer and producer of the elton john-penned musical , a position which will make the most of the rights that gave it the hit film interview with a vampire in 1994 , and the sequel queen of the damned in 2002 .
film studio mgm set up company mgm on stage for similar reasons - developing and licensing vintage mgm films for stage production .
set up in 2002 by two mgm executives , a former broadway performer and a theatrical lawyer , current productions include chitty chitty bang bang , theatre of blood and the broadway musical dirty rotten scoundrels .
legally blonde , moonstruck and the pink panther are other mgm projects currently in development for the stage .
the commercial momentum has been fuelled by the number of musicals dominating broadway based on non-musical film scripts - " movicals " .
the idea is not new .
" movicals " have been around since the 1950s , with the 1961 musical carnival - based on the film lili - often cited as the first commercial hit in the genre .
the birth of the talking picture in the 1920s opened up a new creative furrow to be ploughed by theatre producers .
sweet charity -lrb- 1966 -rrb- - a revival of which recently closed on broadway - was originally inspired by the 1957 fellini film nights of cabiria , while lloyd webber 's sunset boulevard took its original inspiration from the 1950 billy wilder film of the same name .
but for every hit " movical " , there have been several misses .
gone with the wind , some like it hot , big and the witches of eastwick have all been made over for musical consumption , with limited appeal .
but with hits like the producers , the genre is seen as worth pursuing .
mel brooks ' comedy began life as a film back in 1968 , earning brooks an academy award for best screenplay .
the film , about a shady theatre producer and his accountant whose plan to stage a musical flop backfires , became a cult hit .
more than 30 years later , in 2001 , the producers made its broadway debut and proved an instant success , paving the way for a surge in " movicals " .
spamalot , based on monty python and the holy grail , and billy elliot are just two movies-turned-stage shows currently doing good business on broadway and the west end .
in an era that has few big name songwriters of the ilk of cole porter , or rodgers and hammerstein , the stage must increasingly rely on other familiar brands .
lord of the rings is the latest hit film bound for the stage , though one could argue that the production is based on jrr tolkien 's trilogy - not the peter jackson films .
but coming hot on the heels of jackson 's oscar success , the musical will undoubtedly benefit from the book 's big screen adaptation .
" a great story is a great story , " marc shaiman , award-winning composer of the musical hairspray , told the new york times , rejecting suggestions that broadway has become creatively stunted by its dependence on hollywood scripts .
also in the pipeline for 2006 are tarzan , a revised version of the color purple and a musical version of adam sandler movie the wedding singer .
animated classic shrek is also bound for the new york stage , with sam mendes as lead producer and the backing of spielberg studio dreamworks .
it follows the musical version of disney classics the lion king and beauty and the beast .

lestat , inspired by anne rice 's the vampire chronicles , is the inaugural production of warner bros theatre ventures , launched in may 2003 to exploit the many library titles and characters owned by the studio .
the film studio warner bros is developer and producer of the elton john-penned musical , a position which will make the most of the rights that gave it the hit film interview with a vampire in 1994 , and the sequel queen of the damned in 2002 .
film studio mgm set up company mgm on stage for similar reasons - developing and licensing vintage mgm films for stage production .
set up in 2002 by two mgm executives , a former broadway performer and a theatrical lawyer , current productions include chitty chitty bang bang , theatre of blood and the broadway musical dirty rotten scoundrels .
legally blonde , moonstruck and the pink panther are other mgm projects currently in development for the stage .
legally blonde is one a number of hit films heading to the stage the commercial momentum has been fuelled by the number of musicals dominating broadway based on non-musical film scripts - " movicals " .
the idea is not new .
" movicals " have been around since the 1950s , with the 1961 musical carnival - based on the film lili - often cited as the first commercial hit in the genre .
the birth of the talking picture in the 1920s opened up a new creative furrow to be ploughed by theatre producers .
sweet charity -lrb- 1966 -rrb- - a revival of which recently closed on broadway - was originally inspired by the 1957 fellini film nights of cabiria , while lloyd webber 's sunset boulevard took its original inspiration from the 1950 billy wilder film of the same name .
but for every hit " movical " , there have been several misses .
gone with the wind , some like it hot , big and the witches of eastwick have all been made over for musical consumption , with limited appeal .
working title helped develop billy elliot : the musical but with hits like the producers , the genre is seen as worth pursuing .
mel brooks ' comedy began life as a film back in 1968 , earning brooks an academy award for best screenplay .
the film , about a shady theatre producer and his accountant whose plan to stage a musical flop backfires , became a cult hit .
more than 30 years later , in 2001 , the producers made its broadway debut and proved an instant success , paving the way for a surge in " movicals " .
spamalot , based on monty python and the holy grail , and billy elliot are just two movies-turned-stage shows currently doing good business on broadway and the west end .
monty python musical spamalot won three tonys in june in an era that has few big name songwriters of the ilk of cole porter , or rodgers and hammerstein , the stage must increasingly rely on other familiar brands .
lord of the rings is the latest hit film bound for the stage , though one could argue that the production is based on jrr tolkien 's trilogy - not the peter jackson films .
but coming hot on the heels of jackson 's oscar success , the musical will undoubtedly benefit from the book 's big screen adaptation .
" a great story is a great story , " marc shaiman , award-winning composer of the musical hairspray , told the new york times , rejecting suggestions that broadway has become creatively stunted by its dependence on hollywood scripts .
also in the pipeline for 2006 are tarzan , a revised version of the color purple and a musical version of adam sandler movie the wedding singer .
the lion king musical has been seen around the world animated classic shrek is also bound for the new york stage , with sam mendes as lead producer and the backing of spielberg studio dreamworks .
it follows the musical version of disney classics the lion king and beauty and the beast .
between them , the disney productions have made more than $ 3.3bn -lrb- £ 1.8bn -rrb- in tickets alone and play in up to 16 cities around the world .
and just to make one 's head ache , the commercial possibilities do not end there .
the musical versions of original movies sunset boulevard and the producers are also lined up for remakes - on the big screen .

tests on mice showed the juice dramatically slowed down prostate cancer cell growth .
pomegranates , native to the middle east , are packed with healthy anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents .
the study , by the university of wisconsin , appears in proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
prostate cancer is now the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the uk .
every year over 30,000 men are diagnosed and 10,000 men die from it . "
our study adds to growing evidence that pomegranates contain very powerful agents against cancer " professor hasan mukhtar previous research has shown pomegranate extract is effective against tumours in mouse skin .
and scientists in israel have shown that drinking a daily glass of the fruit 's juice can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
the wisconsin team first tested the juice on laboratory cultures of human prostate cancer cells .
they found the extract killed the cancer cells - and the higher the dose , the more cells died .
supplemented diet next the team injected mice with human prostate cancer cells .
one group was given pure water , and two others received water supplemented with 0.1 % or 0.2 % pomegranate juice .
cancer progression was significantly slowed in mice receiving the higher pomegranate dose .
their blood contained decreased levels of prostate-specific antigen -lrb- psa -rrb- , a marker commonly used to monitor prostate cancer .
in comparison , tumours grew much faster in animals that were given only water .
lead researcher professor hasan mukhtar said : " our study , while early , adds to growing evidence that pomegranates contain very powerful agents against cancer , particularly prostate cancer .
" there is good reason now to test this fruit in humans , both for cancer prevention and treatment . "
dr chris hiley , of the prostate cancer charity , said : " this is useful research as it might well benefit both men who may get prostate cancer and men who already have it .
" it 's still to early to know what , if anything , the science will tell us about potential effects in men , but it is not too soon to point out that diet is plainly significant in the development of prostate cancer .
" as there are sound reasons for adopting a healthy diet with a generally increased intake of fruit and vegetables , why not consider pomegranate , and its juice , as one of the ways of achieving this . "

not so on the net where hi-tech criminals can be a continent away from their victims and often route control commands through a chain of computers to hide their tracks .
one area turning out to be a hotbed of hi-tech crime is eastern europe .
enormously successful tech savvy gangs have been traced to russia , romania , ukraine , estonia , latvia and lithuania .
crime spree andrew shearer , who studied computer crime in eastern europe for his ma in history at the university of keele , believes part of the reason for this growth of cyber crime groups is cultural .
russia 's shadow economy has a very long history , said mr shearer .
" it 's a way of life , " he said , " a way of getting round official restrictions .
evading taxes is a national pastime . "
" they are professional , they have built an entire business around it lance james , secure science " many people did not want to get involved with the state and so worked in the shadow economy and derived their living from that , " he said .
the legacy of this is that the network to commit crimes and deal with the proceeds is well established .
" it 's a very loose and fluid way of organising crime , " he said adding that it has a very different character to mafia groups elsewhere that keep criminality within an extended family .
add to this a history of the kgb actively recruiting hackers and lots of unemployed scientists and you have a great recipe for a skilled , criminally-minded digital underground .
" a lot of those in the scientific and technical community were well trained but had no jobs and it 's understandable that they would work for criminal means , " said mr shearer .
mikko hyppönen , chief research officer at finnish computer security firm f-secure , agrees that eastern europe has a ready pool of technically smart talent to call on .
" if there are a lot of people with a lot of computer skills but they do not have many chances to use those skills to make a living then they will start to find alternative uses for those skills , " he told the bbc news website .
what these people have realised now is that hi-tech crime can be very lucrative .
" hackers and virus writers used to do it just to show they could , " said mr hypponen .
" sooner or later though they started to figure they could make real money out of it . "
many are making significant sums of money from their dark digital trade .
phishing gangs try to grab login details to online accounts lance james , chief technical officer for secure science , who spends his time tracking down hi-tech crime groups estimates that each phishing gang is making between $ 100,000 to $ 300,000 per month .
his investigative work leads him to believe that there are between 50 and 60 eastern european groups involved in phishing .
approximately 75 % of all the phishing e-mails sent out originate from only 42 of these crime groups .
this type of computer crime involves sending out e-mails that look like they come from legitimate financial institutions and try to con people into handing over login details for online accounts .
many of the eastern european crime groups were very well organised , said mr james .
" they are professional , they have built an entire business around it , " he said .
" most of the phishers are not tech savvy but they know hackers and virus creators . "
they tended to hire the technicians for each project and use them to set up systems online to support phishing attacks .
phishing lure first the groups spend a lot of time testing phishing e-mails to ensure they get through anti-spam and anti-virus filters .
they then set up " base camps " that co-ordinate the phishing attack .
these hold lists of those e-mailed and the so-called ' bot nets of compromised pcs used to send out the fraudulent messages .
also created are " dead drops " which store all the data gathered by each attack .
some groups have a hit list of more than a million addresses , others use tighter targeting and stagger attacks over weeks and months , said mr james .
some phishing gangs are now looking to launder cash a distinction is now forming between groups happy to try to trick people into handing over login details and those that use worms and trojans to steal the information .
the conmen send fewer more targeted messages than the worm writers who send huge amounts to ensure they hit enough victims .
groups in different nations also work in different ways .
russian phishing gangs tend to be tight communities that prefer communicating with closed circle chat programs such as icq .
by contrast romanian gangs are much more open and instead use well-known irc chat channels to keep in touch .
many have proved so successful at what they do that now they have stepped back from phishing for themselves and instead are selling kits that tell people how to do it themselves .
the manuals and faqs provided tell people how to set up phishing networks and how to launder the cash that they get back .
cleaning the huge amounts of money that some groups have stolen has forced a change in the types of online accounts that some phishing gangs are keen to compromise .
many russian phishing gangs are now trying to get hold of accounts that are happy to have large amounts of money moving through them so they can clean the cash .
