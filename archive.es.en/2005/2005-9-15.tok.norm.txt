while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "
in 1954 , herberger , the german national soccer team 's coach , led his group to victory in the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger carried on the shoulders of german national soccer player in a film about the german 1954 soccer victory .
the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 . " he never had anything to do with ideologies , but he was willingly used for the inhuman ideology , " said niels havemann , the author of the first comprehensive book on the dfb 's role during the nazi era , adding that herberger cooperated with the nazis on a 1941 propaganda film called " das grosse spiel " -lrb- " the great game " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger in march 1977 , just a month before his death .
" unfortunately , a shadow is falling over sepp herberger , " said german sports minister otto schily during a presentation of the book , according to reuters news service .
" he let himself become part of the nazi propaganda . " hitler 's ig n ora n t backers dfb officials commissioned havemann , a historian at mainz university , to write the book , which is entitled " fussball unterm hakenkreuz " -lrb- " soccer under the swastika " -rrb- .
studying previously unknown documents from 40 archives in germany and abroad , havemann came to the conclusion that , like herberger , who was 80 when he died in 1977 , most dfb leaders did n't support the nazis out of conviction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havemann -lrb- left -rrb- , zwanziger -lrb- center -rrb- and schily during the book presentation instead , their thoughtlessness , ignorance , opportunism or professional ambition led them to support the hitler regime , making them accomplices to its system of oppression , persecution , war and destruction . " it 's perfectly clear that the dfb 's leadership was not part of the resistance , " said theo zwanziger , the current president of the dfb , which is the world 's largest single sport association .
" people did n't jump on the chances this popular sport would have offered to resist the regime at least a little . " sheddi n g light ahead of world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in light of next year 's world cup in germany , schily also said the book could answer questions many foreign visitors are bound to ask . " i can imagine a lot of visitors will be here and asking what happened between 1933 and 1945 , " he said .
" i think this will make an important contribution to those discussions . " a n award for tolera n ce dfb officials have meanwhile established an award in honor of former german national team player julius hirsch , who was killed by the nazis at auschwitz death camp . " with this award , we want to show that we think it 's everybody 's duty to stand up for our democratic and constitutional values , " zwanziger said .
" we want to use our position in society to promote freedom , tolerance and humanity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's players celebrate after winning the german soccer championship 2005 the first recipient of the award , which will be given to honor work against racism and xenophobia , is bayern munich .
dfb officials said the soccer club had an unparalleled history of fighting anti-semitism and cited a recent friendly match between young bayern players and israeli and palestinian players organized by the club as an example . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler 's chosen artists walked fine line between art and politics the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .

18 ?
german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time . "
that meant there was room for the stock markets to fall back in disappointment . furthermore , many reform measures could actually have a negative effect on the economy and on the stock markets in the short term .
and the months of september and october were traditionally seen as the weakest for the equity markets , anyway , kleff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record high oil prices were another negative factor that could weigh on investor sentiment , raising the likelihood of a large-scale correction on the stock markets , he added . gra n d coalitio n n ot all bad hartiss said that a grand coalition need not be a recipe for policy paralysis . " history seems to suggest that a grand coalition is not all gloom and doom , " she said .
" arguably , the grand coalition of the late 1960s steered the economy out of a recession and implemented both financial and macro-economic reforms . " the best outcome would be the election of an effective administration committed to continue economic reform , " hartiss added .
" this may be almost as likely under a rejuvenated spd government as one led by a lacklustre cdu . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

fiery arsenal thun showdown the other group matches played wednesday saw european soccer heavyweights salvaging points against sides considered minnows of the champions league .
arsenal were spared the embarrassment of a 1-1 draw with swiss side thun wednesday .
thun , who beat dynamo kiev and malmö in the qualifying rounds , proved tenacious when nelson ferreira looped in an equaliser two minutes after arsenal 's opening goal , a header by brazilian midfielder gilberto silva after 51 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's fredrik ljungberg , front , collides with fc thun goalkeeper eldin jakupovic the london side was also reduced to 10 men just before the break with a red card shown to striker robin van persie for dangerous play .
arsenal then struggled to find further openings until 36-year-old substitute dennis bergkamp lobbed home the winner with his first champions league goal for three years .
van persie 's sending-off had arsenal club manager , arsene wenger fuming and ranting after yet another red card for his team .
" he -lrb- polish referee grzegorz gilewski -rrb- was flying high , he did n't watch the game , " the frenchman raged .
" the sending-off was an unpleasant surprise and the wrong decision .
it was not robin 's fault .
it was an accident .
for me , it was never a red card . "
thun boss urs schoenenberger was upset at the way bergkamp robbed them of a precious point at the death .
" i lost a point but if you consider where we played against whom we played , then this would have been the result you expected , " schoenenberger said .
" the way we lost is really disappointing , especially as we had one man more and we were holding them 1-1 right to the end .
but you ca n't say that inside we 're really torn apart . "
disappointment and relief lisbon club benfica scraped a 1-0 win over unheralded french side lille also in time added-on through a header from probably the smallest man on the pitch , fabrizio miccoli .
while lille coach claude puel bemoaned the lack of concentration from his young team his benfica counterpart koeman said that it had been the right result - as indeed he would do .
" we created more and wanted victory more .
this win was logical , " the former dutch international great said .

good night for italian clubs italian clubs had a good night as juventus recorded a 2-1 victory away at bruges with daviod trezeguet scoring his 100th goal for the club moving ever closer to french compatriot michel platini 's club record of 104 .
though juve 's french hardman midfielder patrick vieira too was given his marching orders in the final minute of the bruges match , trezeguet was jubiliant .
" it 's 100 goals , " said trezeguet .
" i 'm very proud of myself and my team-mates .
it 's part of the history of this club and it 's something exceptional . "
vincenzo iaquinta scored a hat-trick in udinese 's maiden champions league match as the unglamorous italian side recorded a 3-0 home victory over greek giants panathinaikos .

"
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .
" i believe that there will be different solutions for different regions of the world . we believe that the diesel engine will continue to be the best solution for the european market , but the hybrid could be the alternative to the straight gasoline engine in north america . " another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years . " they recognize the success that toyota and lexus have had in the north american suv market and now they have to offer hybrids in order not to loose market share , " explained felix bauer , managing editor of germany 's automobilwoche . despite their late entry into the game , all of the major german player 's present at the frankfurt motor show echo the sentiments of wolfgang steiger , director of powertrain research at volkswagen : " the first hybrid cars came from japan , but it 's often true that the first is always the best ! we have been developing hybrid systems and we are pretty sure we can place a system in the market which meets or exceeds the japanese systems , but with less cost . " a wealth of suv 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an s-class mercedes-benz with a bluetec hybridmotor in order to enter the market as quickly as possible , german auto manufacturers have been establishing partnerships to reduce the significant development costs of installing these new component systems . in early september , bmw announced its plan to partner with daimlerchrysler and general motors to manufacture a hybrid drivetrain . shortly thereafter , audi , volkswagen and porsche also formed a partnership to develop a hybrid system for their suv lines - namely the vw touareg , the audi q7 and the porsche cayenne . as gas prices in the us continue to inch upward , americans who relish the space and performance of suv 's are turning to hybrid models to recoup a few precious gallons at the pump . for a country that is used to setting the precedent for innovation , felix bauer claims that germany is currently riding in the back seat .
" porsche always said that they would never make a hybrid , but now lexus has shown that they can make a very speedy hybrid engine . maybe this is a time for the germans to show that they have the engineering chops to compete .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.09.2005 german soccer faces nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heil hitler " : the german national soccer team in 1941 sixty years after the end of world war ii , germany 's soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has presented a study of its role during the nazi era .
while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "
in 1954 , herberger , the german national soccer team 's coach , led his group to victory in the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger carried on the shoulders of german national soccer player in a film about the german 1954 soccer victory .
the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 .

while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "
in 1954 , herberger , the german national soccer team 's coach , led his group to victory in the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger carried on the shoulders of german national soccer player in a film about the german 1954 soccer victory .
the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 . " he never had anything to do with ideologies , but he was willingly used for the inhuman ideology , " said niels havemann , the author of the first comprehensive book on the dfb 's role during the nazi era , adding that herberger cooperated with the nazis on a 1941 propaganda film called " das grosse spiel " -lrb- " the great game " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger in march 1977 , just a month before his death .

on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .

on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio .

german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .

german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.09.2005 german soccer faces nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " heil hitler " : the german national soccer team in 1941 sixty years after the end of world war ii , germany 's soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- has presented a study of its role during the nazi era .
while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "
in 1954 , herberger , the german national soccer team 's coach , led his group to victory in the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger carried on the shoulders of german national soccer player in a film about the german 1954 soccer victory .
the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 . " he never had anything to do with ideologies , but he was willingly used for the inhuman ideology , " said niels havemann , the author of the first comprehensive book on the dfb 's role during the nazi era , adding that herberger cooperated with the nazis on a 1941 propaganda film called " das grosse spiel " -lrb- " the great game " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger in march 1977 , just a month before his death .
" unfortunately , a shadow is falling over sepp herberger , " said german sports minister otto schily during a presentation of the book , according to reuters news service .
" he let himself become part of the nazi propaganda . " hitler 's ig n ora n t backers dfb officials commissioned havemann , a historian at mainz university , to write the book , which is entitled " fussball unterm hakenkreuz " -lrb- " soccer under the swastika " -rrb- .
studying previously unknown documents from 40 archives in germany and abroad , havemann came to the conclusion that , like herberger , who was 80 when he died in 1977 , most dfb leaders did n't support the nazis out of conviction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havemann -lrb- left -rrb- , zwanziger -lrb- center -rrb- and schily during the book presentation instead , their thoughtlessness , ignorance , opportunism or professional ambition led them to support the hitler regime , making them accomplices to its system of oppression , persecution , war and destruction . " it 's perfectly clear that the dfb 's leadership was not part of the resistance , " said theo zwanziger , the current president of the dfb , which is the world 's largest single sport association .
" people did n't jump on the chances this popular sport would have offered to resist the regime at least a little . " sheddi n g light ahead of world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in light of next year 's world cup in germany , schily also said the book could answer questions many foreign visitors are bound to ask . " i can imagine a lot of visitors will be here and asking what happened between 1933 and 1945 , " he said .
" i think this will make an important contribution to those discussions . " a n award for tolera n ce dfb officials have meanwhile established an award in honor of former german national team player julius hirsch , who was killed by the nazis at auschwitz death camp . " with this award , we want to show that we think it 's everybody 's duty to stand up for our democratic and constitutional values , " zwanziger said .
" we want to use our position in society to promote freedom , tolerance and humanity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's players celebrate after winning the german soccer championship 2005 the first recipient of the award , which will be given to honor work against racism and xenophobia , is bayern munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.09.2005 in digital age , a look to the stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music , music everywhere it was with much fanfare about the future of germany 's popular music industry that the 2005 popkomm festival opened in berlin .
on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is due in new york thursday . " france is open to dialogue and a contact is possible if the iranians want it , " said a french diplomat on condition of anonymity , adding there was no confirmation at this stage . another european diplomat said he was hopeful the meeting would take place . the necessity of such a meeting took on new urgency after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was reported as telling turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan that iran was willing to " transfer nuclear know-how " to other islamic countries . " the islamic republic never seeks weapons of mass destruction and with respect to the needs of islamic countries , we are ready to transfer nuclear know-how to these countries , " the official iranian news agency .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is due in new york thursday . " france is open to dialogue and a contact is possible if the iranians want it , " said a french diplomat on condition of anonymity , adding there was no confirmation at this stage . another european diplomat said he was hopeful the meeting would take place . the necessity of such a meeting took on new urgency after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was reported as telling turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan that iran was willing to " transfer nuclear know-how " to other islamic countries . " the islamic republic never seeks weapons of mass destruction and with respect to the needs of islamic countries , we are ready to transfer nuclear know-how to these countries , " the official iranian news agency .
irna , quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
observers say the offer is an attempt to strengthen backing for iran 's stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin french prime minister dominique de villepin " strongly " called for iran to keep its nuclear non-proliferation promises or face action before the security council . as a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran insists it is allowed to make nuclear fuel .
president ahmadinejad took a swipe at un members who felt their wealth and power gave them " extended rights " not accorded to other countries . rice : may n ot have votes as washington lobbied china , india , russia and other countries to back referral of iran to the un security council for resuming sensitive nuclear activities , us secretary of state condoleezza rice signaled washington may not have the votes at a key meeting next week .
rice was cautious on prospects for seeking un action against the iranians when the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un nuclear watchdog , meets in vienna on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " if we get a referral -lrb- of iran -rrb- on sept .

" i 'm not so concerned about exactly when it happens because i do n't think this matter is so urgent that it has to be on sept .
19 , " she said .
" this is more about a political message to iran right now than anything else . "

rice said she saw no resistance from the europeans to taking the issue to the un security council .
iranians rejected a package of economic and security incentives offered by the europeans in exchange for the islamic republic renouncing its nuclear arms ambitions . " i still think that there is quite a bit of room and scope to put enough pressure on iran diplomatically to at least constrain iranian activities significantly , " rice said . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has urged the united states to give iran one last chance to halt suspected weapons-related nuclear activities , diplomats in vienna said wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win , dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran flouts europe and future negotiations un nuclear watchdog chief mohamed elbaradei met with iran 's new negotiator in vienna on friday as the islamic republic continues its brazen rhetoric .

while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "

the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 . " he never had anything to do with ideologies , but he was willingly used for the inhuman ideology , " said niels havemann , the author of the first comprehensive book on the dfb 's role during the nazi era , adding that herberger cooperated with the nazis on a 1941 propaganda film called " das grosse spiel " -lrb- " the great game " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger in march 1977 , just a month before his death .

while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "
in 1954 , herberger , the german national soccer team 's coach , led his group to victory in the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger carried on the shoulders of german national soccer player in a film about the german 1954 soccer victory .
the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 . " he never had anything to do with ideologies , but he was willingly used for the inhuman ideology , " said niels havemann , the author of the first comprehensive book on the dfb 's role during the nazi era , adding that herberger cooperated with the nazis on a 1941 propaganda film called " das grosse spiel " -lrb- " the great game " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger in march 1977 , just a month before his death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.09.2005 in digital age , a look to the stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music , music everywhere it was with much fanfare about the future of germany 's popular music industry that the 2005 popkomm festival opened in berlin .
on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio .

while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "
in 1954 , herberger , the german national soccer team 's coach , led his group to victory in the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger carried on the shoulders of german national soccer player in a film about the german 1954 soccer victory .
the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 . " he never had anything to do with ideologies , but he was willingly used for the inhuman ideology , " said niels havemann , the author of the first comprehensive book on the dfb 's role during the nazi era , adding that herberger cooperated with the nazis on a 1941 propaganda film called " das grosse spiel " -lrb- " the great game " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger in march 1977 , just a month before his death .
" unfortunately , a shadow is falling over sepp herberger , " said german sports minister otto schily during a presentation of the book , according to reuters news service .
" he let himself become part of the nazi propaganda . " hitler 's ig n ora n t backers dfb officials commissioned havemann , a historian at mainz university , to write the book , which is entitled " fussball unterm hakenkreuz " -lrb- " soccer under the swastika " -rrb- .
studying previously unknown documents from 40 archives in germany and abroad , havemann came to the conclusion that , like herberger , who was 80 when he died in 1977 , most dfb leaders did n't support the nazis out of conviction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havemann -lrb- left -rrb- , zwanziger -lrb- center -rrb- and schily during the book presentation instead , their thoughtlessness , ignorance , opportunism or professional ambition led them to support the hitler regime , making them accomplices to its system of oppression , persecution , war and destruction . " it 's perfectly clear that the dfb 's leadership was not part of the resistance , " said theo zwanziger , the current president of the dfb , which is the world 's largest single sport association .
" people did n't jump on the chances this popular sport would have offered to resist the regime at least a little . " sheddi n g light ahead of world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in light of next year 's world cup in germany , schily also said the book could answer questions many foreign visitors are bound to ask . " i can imagine a lot of visitors will be here and asking what happened between 1933 and 1945 , " he said .
" i think this will make an important contribution to those discussions . " a n award for tolera n ce dfb officials have meanwhile established an award in honor of former german national team player julius hirsch , who was killed by the nazis at auschwitz death camp . " with this award , we want to show that we think it 's everybody 's duty to stand up for our democratic and constitutional values , " zwanziger said .
" we want to use our position in society to promote freedom , tolerance and humanity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's players celebrate after winning the german soccer championship 2005 the first recipient of the award , which will be given to honor work against racism and xenophobia , is bayern munich .
dfb officials said the soccer club had an unparalleled history of fighting anti-semitism and cited a recent friendly match between young bayern players and israeli and palestinian players organized by the club as an example . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler 's chosen artists walked fine line between art and politics the nazis compiled a secret list of “ divinely gifted ” artists , who received favorable treatment in return for entertaining the masses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2005 germans rush to tap hybrid market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi q7 hybrid , one of germany 's new concept cars spurred on by soaring fuel prices , german carmakers bmw , audi , volkswagen and porsche have announced plans to offer hybrid vehicles by 2008 . at this year 's iaa international motor show in frankfurt , words like " hybrid " and " biodiesel " were almost as sexy as " convertible " or " super-sport . "
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .
" i believe that there will be different solutions for different regions of the world . we believe that the diesel engine will continue to be the best solution for the european market , but the hybrid could be the alternative to the straight gasoline engine in north america . " another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years . " they recognize the success that toyota and lexus have had in the north american suv market and now they have to offer hybrids in order not to loose market share , " explained felix bauer , managing editor of germany 's automobilwoche . despite their late entry into the game , all of the major german player 's present at the frankfurt motor show echo the sentiments of wolfgang steiger , director of powertrain research at volkswagen : " the first hybrid cars came from japan , but it 's often true that the first is always the best ! we have been developing hybrid systems and we are pretty sure we can place a system in the market which meets or exceeds the japanese systems , but with less cost . " a wealth of suv 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an s-class mercedes-benz with a bluetec hybridmotor in order to enter the market as quickly as possible , german auto manufacturers have been establishing partnerships to reduce the significant development costs of installing these new component systems . in early september , bmw announced its plan to partner with daimlerchrysler and general motors to manufacture a hybrid drivetrain . shortly thereafter , audi , volkswagen and porsche also formed a partnership to develop a hybrid system for their suv lines - namely the vw touareg , the audi q7 and the porsche cayenne . as gas prices in the us continue to inch upward , americans who relish the space and performance of suv 's are turning to hybrid models to recoup a few precious gallons at the pump . for a country that is used to setting the precedent for innovation , felix bauer claims that germany is currently riding in the back seat .
" porsche always said that they would never make a hybrid , but now lexus has shown that they can make a very speedy hybrid engine . maybe this is a time for the germans to show that they have the engineering chops to compete . " adam allington , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high fuel prices push alternative engines record prices at gas stations caused in part by the devastating effects of hurricane katrina have knocked discussion in germany about alternative engines into high gear ahead of this month 's auto show .

german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time .

and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2005 germans rush to tap hybrid market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi q7 hybrid , one of germany 's new concept cars spurred on by soaring fuel prices , german carmakers bmw , audi , volkswagen and porsche have announced plans to offer hybrid vehicles by 2008 . at this year 's iaa international motor show in frankfurt , words like " hybrid " and " biodiesel " were almost as sexy as " convertible " or " super-sport . "
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .
" i believe that there will be different solutions for different regions of the world . we believe that the diesel engine will continue to be the best solution for the european market , but the hybrid could be the alternative to the straight gasoline engine in north america . " another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years . " they recognize the success that toyota and lexus have had in the north american suv market and now they have to offer hybrids in order not to loose market share , " explained felix bauer , managing editor of germany 's automobilwoche . despite their late entry into the game , all of the major german player 's present at the frankfurt motor show echo the sentiments of wolfgang steiger , director of powertrain research at volkswagen : " the first hybrid cars came from japan , but it 's often true that the first is always the best ! we have been developing hybrid systems and we are pretty sure we can place a system in the market which meets or exceeds the japanese systems , but with less cost . " a wealth of suv 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an s-class mercedes-benz with a bluetec hybridmotor in order to enter the market as quickly as possible , german auto manufacturers have been establishing partnerships to reduce the significant development costs of installing these new component systems . in early september , bmw announced its plan to partner with daimlerchrysler and general motors to manufacture a hybrid drivetrain . shortly thereafter , audi , volkswagen and porsche also formed a partnership to develop a hybrid system for their suv lines - namely the vw touareg , the audi q7 and the porsche cayenne . as gas prices in the us continue to inch upward , americans who relish the space and performance of suv 's are turning to hybrid models to recoup a few precious gallons at the pump . for a country that is used to setting the precedent for innovation , felix bauer claims that germany is currently riding in the back seat .
" porsche always said that they would never make a hybrid , but now lexus has shown that they can make a very speedy hybrid engine . maybe this is a time for the germans to show that they have the engineering chops to compete . " adam allington , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high fuel prices push alternative engines record prices at gas stations caused in part by the devastating effects of hurricane katrina have knocked discussion in germany about alternative engines into high gear ahead of this month 's auto show .

"
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .
" i believe that there will be different solutions for different regions of the world . we believe that the diesel engine will continue to be the best solution for the european market , but the hybrid could be the alternative to the straight gasoline engine in north america . " another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years . " they recognize the success that toyota and lexus have had in the north american suv market and now they have to offer hybrids in order not to loose market share , " explained felix bauer , managing editor of germany 's automobilwoche . despite their late entry into the game , all of the major german player 's present at the frankfurt motor show echo the sentiments of wolfgang steiger , director of powertrain research at volkswagen : " the first hybrid cars came from japan , but it 's often true that the first is always the best ! we have been developing hybrid systems and we are pretty sure we can place a system in the market which meets or exceeds the japanese systems , but with less cost . " a wealth of suv 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an s-class mercedes-benz with a bluetec hybridmotor in order to enter the market as quickly as possible , german auto manufacturers have been establishing partnerships to reduce the significant development costs of installing these new component systems . in early september , bmw announced its plan to partner with daimlerchrysler and general motors to manufacture a hybrid drivetrain . shortly thereafter , audi , volkswagen and porsche also formed a partnership to develop a hybrid system for their suv lines - namely the vw touareg , the audi q7 and the porsche cayenne . as gas prices in the us continue to inch upward , americans who relish the space and performance of suv 's are turning to hybrid models to recoup a few precious gallons at the pump . for a country that is used to setting the precedent for innovation , felix bauer claims that germany is currently riding in the back seat .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio . " tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de censoring german rap some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .
the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go .
-lrb- june 29 , 2005 -rrb- sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?
probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .
the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago .

but , barca was then made to sweat as bremen battered the star team with relentless attacking .
but , deprived of german forward miroslav klose through suspension , bremen saw a succession of chances wasted as ivan klasnic and nelson valdez gave their best but failed to score .
a penalty kick by ronaldinho in the second half helped barcelona drive in the final nail into bremen 's flagging game and romp to victory .
bildunterschrift : nelson valdez , left , frank baumann , centre , and barcelona 's xavi , right , challenge for the ball barcelona coach frank rijkaard said he was satisfied with the way his side had performed .
" i 'm happy , " rijkard said .
" if you just count the number of chances you could see it could have been a different result but we scored twice against a very strong team at their ground so of course i 'm happy , " he said .
" we suffered , they played very well but you have to score goals to get a win or come from behind to get a draw . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf admitted his team 's failings .
" they took their chances and we did n't , " he said .
" we invested a lot in this game , running and fighting for everything , but we come away with nothing , " schaf said .
" i would have liked to get something , even just one goal . "
fiery arsenal thun showdown the other group matches played wednesday saw european soccer heavyweights salvaging points against sides considered minnows of the champions league .
arsenal were spared the embarrassment of a 1-1 draw with swiss side thun wednesday .
thun , who beat dynamo kiev and malmö in the qualifying rounds , proved tenacious when nelson ferreira looped in an equaliser two minutes after arsenal 's opening goal , a header by brazilian midfielder gilberto silva after 51 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's fredrik ljungberg , front , collides with fc thun goalkeeper eldin jakupovic the london side was also reduced to 10 men just before the break with a red card shown to striker robin van persie for dangerous play .
arsenal then struggled to find further openings until 36-year-old substitute dennis bergkamp lobbed home the winner with his first champions league goal for three years .
van persie 's sending-off had arsenal club manager , arsene wenger fuming and ranting after yet another red card for his team .
" he -lrb- polish referee grzegorz gilewski -rrb- was flying high , he did n't watch the game , " the frenchman raged .
" the sending-off was an unpleasant surprise and the wrong decision .
it was not robin 's fault .
it was an accident .
for me , it was never a red card . "
thun boss urs schoenenberger was upset at the way bergkamp robbed them of a precious point at the death .
" i lost a point but if you consider where we played against whom we played , then this would have been the result you expected , " schoenenberger said .
" the way we lost is really disappointing , especially as we had one man more and we were holding them 1-1 right to the end .
but you ca n't say that inside we 're really torn apart . "
disappointment and relief lisbon club benfica scraped a 1-0 win over unheralded french side lille also in time added-on through a header from probably the smallest man on the pitch , fabrizio miccoli .
while lille coach claude puel bemoaned the lack of concentration from his young team his benfica counterpart koeman said that it had been the right result - as indeed he would do .
" we created more and wanted victory more .
this win was logical , " the former dutch international great said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin petras , left , and zdenek pospech , right , both of sparta , challenge for a ball with markus rosenberg , center , of ajax there was also to be last-minute disappointment for czech republic outfit sparta prague as they were held 1-1 at home by dutch giants ajax - a club formerly managed by benfica 's handler ronald koeman - with wesley sneijder 's stunning effort giving them a point .
good night for italian clubs italian clubs had a good night as juventus recorded a 2-1 victory away at bruges with daviod trezeguet scoring his 100th goal for the club moving ever closer to french compatriot michel platini 's club record of 104 .
though juve 's french hardman midfielder patrick vieira too was given his marching orders in the final minute of the bruges match , trezeguet was jubiliant .
" it 's 100 goals , " said trezeguet .
" i 'm very proud of myself and my team-mates .
it 's part of the history of this club and it 's something exceptional . "
vincenzo iaquinta scored a hat-trick in udinese 's maiden champions league match as the unglamorous italian side recorded a 3-0 home victory over greek giants panathinaikos .
the good was balanced by the ugly as fiery england striker wayne rooney capped a pretty disastrous last 10 days for england and manchester united by being sent off for two bookable offences - the second for dissent at his initial booking - in united 's 0-0 away draw with spanish side villarreal .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is due in new york thursday . " france is open to dialogue and a contact is possible if the iranians want it , " said a french diplomat on condition of anonymity , adding there was no confirmation at this stage . another european diplomat said he was hopeful the meeting would take place . the necessity of such a meeting took on new urgency after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was reported as telling turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan that iran was willing to " transfer nuclear know-how " to other islamic countries . " the islamic republic never seeks weapons of mass destruction and with respect to the needs of islamic countries , we are ready to transfer nuclear know-how to these countries , " the official iranian news agency .
irna , quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
observers say the offer is an attempt to strengthen backing for iran 's stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin french prime minister dominique de villepin " strongly " called for iran to keep its nuclear non-proliferation promises or face action before the security council . as a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran insists it is allowed to make nuclear fuel .
president ahmadinejad took a swipe at un members who felt their wealth and power gave them " extended rights " not accorded to other countries . rice : may n ot have votes as washington lobbied china , india , russia and other countries to back referral of iran to the un security council for resuming sensitive nuclear activities , us secretary of state condoleezza rice signaled washington may not have the votes at a key meeting next week .
rice was cautious on prospects for seeking un action against the iranians when the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un nuclear watchdog , meets in vienna on monday .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is due in new york thursday . " france is open to dialogue and a contact is possible if the iranians want it , " said a french diplomat on condition of anonymity , adding there was no confirmation at this stage . another european diplomat said he was hopeful the meeting would take place . the necessity of such a meeting took on new urgency after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was reported as telling turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan that iran was willing to " transfer nuclear know-how " to other islamic countries . " the islamic republic never seeks weapons of mass destruction and with respect to the needs of islamic countries , we are ready to transfer nuclear know-how to these countries , " the official iranian news agency .
irna , quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
observers say the offer is an attempt to strengthen backing for iran 's stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin french prime minister dominique de villepin " strongly " called for iran to keep its nuclear non-proliferation promises or face action before the security council . as a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran insists it is allowed to make nuclear fuel .
president ahmadinejad took a swipe at un members who felt their wealth and power gave them " extended rights " not accorded to other countries . rice : may n ot have votes as washington lobbied china , india , russia and other countries to back referral of iran to the un security council for resuming sensitive nuclear activities , us secretary of state condoleezza rice signaled washington may not have the votes at a key meeting next week .
rice was cautious on prospects for seeking un action against the iranians when the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un nuclear watchdog , meets in vienna on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " if we get a referral -lrb- of iran -rrb- on sept .
19 , that will be good , but i think the issue of a referral is something that we 'll be working for a while , " she said .
" i 'm not so concerned about exactly when it happens because i do n't think this matter is so urgent that it has to be on sept .
19 , " she said .
" this is more about a political message to iran right now than anything else . "

rice said she saw no resistance from the europeans to taking the issue to the un security council .
iranians rejected a package of economic and security incentives offered by the europeans in exchange for the islamic republic renouncing its nuclear arms ambitions . " i still think that there is quite a bit of room and scope to put enough pressure on iran diplomatically to at least constrain iranian activities significantly , " rice said . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has urged the united states to give iran one last chance to halt suspected weapons-related nuclear activities , diplomats in vienna said wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win , dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran flouts europe and future negotiations un nuclear watchdog chief mohamed elbaradei met with iran 's new negotiator in vienna on friday as the islamic republic continues its brazen rhetoric .

"
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .
" i believe that there will be different solutions for different regions of the world . we believe that the diesel engine will continue to be the best solution for the european market , but the hybrid could be the alternative to the straight gasoline engine in north america . " another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years .

but , barca was then made to sweat as bremen battered the star team with relentless attacking .
but , deprived of german forward miroslav klose through suspension , bremen saw a succession of chances wasted as ivan klasnic and nelson valdez gave their best but failed to score .
a penalty kick by ronaldinho in the second half helped barcelona drive in the final nail into bremen 's flagging game and romp to victory .
bildunterschrift : nelson valdez , left , frank baumann , centre , and barcelona 's xavi , right , challenge for the ball barcelona coach frank rijkaard said he was satisfied with the way his side had performed .
" i 'm happy , " rijkard said .
" if you just count the number of chances you could see it could have been a different result but we scored twice against a very strong team at their ground so of course i 'm happy , " he said .
" we suffered , they played very well but you have to score goals to get a win or come from behind to get a draw . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf admitted his team 's failings .
" they took their chances and we did n't , " he said .
" we invested a lot in this game , running and fighting for everything , but we come away with nothing , " schaf said .
" i would have liked to get something , even just one goal . "
fiery arsenal thun showdown the other group matches played wednesday saw european soccer heavyweights salvaging points against sides considered minnows of the champions league .
arsenal were spared the embarrassment of a 1-1 draw with swiss side thun wednesday .
thun , who beat dynamo kiev and malmö in the qualifying rounds , proved tenacious when nelson ferreira looped in an equaliser two minutes after arsenal 's opening goal , a header by brazilian midfielder gilberto silva after 51 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's fredrik ljungberg , front , collides with fc thun goalkeeper eldin jakupovic the london side was also reduced to 10 men just before the break with a red card shown to striker robin van persie for dangerous play .
arsenal then struggled to find further openings until 36-year-old substitute dennis bergkamp lobbed home the winner with his first champions league goal for three years .
van persie 's sending-off had arsenal club manager , arsene wenger fuming and ranting after yet another red card for his team .
" he -lrb- polish referee grzegorz gilewski -rrb- was flying high , he did n't watch the game , " the frenchman raged .
" the sending-off was an unpleasant surprise and the wrong decision .
it was not robin 's fault .
it was an accident .
for me , it was never a red card . "
thun boss urs schoenenberger was upset at the way bergkamp robbed them of a precious point at the death .
" i lost a point but if you consider where we played against whom we played , then this would have been the result you expected , " schoenenberger said .
" the way we lost is really disappointing , especially as we had one man more and we were holding them 1-1 right to the end .
but you ca n't say that inside we 're really torn apart . "
disappointment and relief lisbon club benfica scraped a 1-0 win over unheralded french side lille also in time added-on through a header from probably the smallest man on the pitch , fabrizio miccoli .
while lille coach claude puel bemoaned the lack of concentration from his young team his benfica counterpart koeman said that it had been the right result - as indeed he would do .
" we created more and wanted victory more .
this win was logical , " the former dutch international great said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin petras , left , and zdenek pospech , right , both of sparta , challenge for a ball with markus rosenberg , center , of ajax there was also to be last-minute disappointment for czech republic outfit sparta prague as they were held 1-1 at home by dutch giants ajax - a club formerly managed by benfica 's handler ronald koeman - with wesley sneijder 's stunning effort giving them a point .
good night for italian clubs italian clubs had a good night as juventus recorded a 2-1 victory away at bruges with daviod trezeguet scoring his 100th goal for the club moving ever closer to french compatriot michel platini 's club record of 104 .
though juve 's french hardman midfielder patrick vieira too was given his marching orders in the final minute of the bruges match , trezeguet was jubiliant .
" it 's 100 goals , " said trezeguet .
" i 'm very proud of myself and my team-mates .
it 's part of the history of this club and it 's something exceptional . "
vincenzo iaquinta scored a hat-trick in udinese 's maiden champions league match as the unglamorous italian side recorded a 3-0 home victory over greek giants panathinaikos .
the good was balanced by the ugly as fiery england striker wayne rooney capped a pretty disastrous last 10 days for england and manchester united by being sent off for two bookable offences - the second for dissent at his initial booking - in united 's 0-0 away draw with spanish side villarreal .

in lower saxony in the north of the country , germany 's biggest poultry-rearing state , chicken , geese , turkey and ducks will be shut inside until the end of november on most farms , state authorities said .
around 10 percent of lower saxony 's annual chicken production of 72 million birds are normally kept outdoors .
similar measures went into operation in mecklenburg-western pommerania and north rhine-westphalia .
some experts however said the measures were excessive .
" only healthy birds migrate , " said ortrud werner of the german national laboratory for avian flu .
" the biggest danger for germany stems from the illegal importing of infected or sick birds , " she said .
russia and kazakhstan have been hit by an epidemic of avian flu , which can be transmitted to humans .
it is the same strain which killed several dozen people in asia . dw-world.de new fowl guidelines aim to check bird flu to prevent the spread of bird flu in europe , the german and dutch governments have introduced plans to require free-range poultry be kept indoors .
but experts say an outbreak in europe is only a question of time .

"
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .
" i believe that there will be different solutions for different regions of the world . we believe that the diesel engine will continue to be the best solution for the european market , but the hybrid could be the alternative to the straight gasoline engine in north america . " another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years . " they recognize the success that toyota and lexus have had in the north american suv market and now they have to offer hybrids in order not to loose market share , " explained felix bauer , managing editor of germany 's automobilwoche . despite their late entry into the game , all of the major german player 's present at the frankfurt motor show echo the sentiments of wolfgang steiger , director of powertrain research at volkswagen : " the first hybrid cars came from japan , but it 's often true that the first is always the best ! we have been developing hybrid systems and we are pretty sure we can place a system in the market which meets or exceeds the japanese systems , but with less cost .

" porsche always said that they would never make a hybrid , but now lexus has shown that they can make a very speedy hybrid engine . maybe this is a time for the germans to show that they have the engineering chops to compete .

" another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years . " they recognize the success that toyota and lexus have had in the north american suv market and now they have to offer hybrids in order not to loose market share , " explained felix bauer , managing editor of germany 's automobilwoche . despite their late entry into the game , all of the major german player 's present at the frankfurt motor show echo the sentiments of wolfgang steiger , director of powertrain research at volkswagen : " the first hybrid cars came from japan , but it 's often true that the first is always the best ! we have been developing hybrid systems and we are pretty sure we can place a system in the market which meets or exceeds the japanese systems , but with less cost . " a wealth of suv 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an s-class mercedes-benz with a bluetec hybridmotor in order to enter the market as quickly as possible , german auto manufacturers have been establishing partnerships to reduce the significant development costs of installing these new component systems . in early september , bmw announced its plan to partner with daimlerchrysler and general motors to manufacture a hybrid drivetrain . shortly thereafter , audi , volkswagen and porsche also formed a partnership to develop a hybrid system for their suv lines - namely the vw touareg , the audi q7 and the porsche cayenne . as gas prices in the us continue to inch upward , americans who relish the space and performance of suv 's are turning to hybrid models to recoup a few precious gallons at the pump . for a country that is used to setting the precedent for innovation , felix bauer claims that germany is currently riding in the back seat .
" porsche always said that they would never make a hybrid , but now lexus has shown that they can make a very speedy hybrid engine . maybe this is a time for the germans to show that they have the engineering chops to compete . " adam allington , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high fuel prices push alternative engines record prices at gas stations caused in part by the devastating effects of hurricane katrina have knocked discussion in germany about alternative engines into high gear ahead of this month 's auto show .

fiery arsenal thun showdown the other group matches played wednesday saw european soccer heavyweights salvaging points against sides considered minnows of the champions league .
arsenal were spared the embarrassment of a 1-1 draw with swiss side thun wednesday .

" the sending-off was an unpleasant surprise and the wrong decision .
it was not robin 's fault .
it was an accident .
for me , it was never a red card . "
thun boss urs schoenenberger was upset at the way bergkamp robbed them of a precious point at the death .
" i lost a point but if you consider where we played against whom we played , then this would have been the result you expected , " schoenenberger said .
" the way we lost is really disappointing , especially as we had one man more and we were holding them 1-1 right to the end .
but you ca n't say that inside we 're really torn apart . "

on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is due in new york thursday . " france is open to dialogue and a contact is possible if the iranians want it , " said a french diplomat on condition of anonymity , adding there was no confirmation at this stage . another european diplomat said he was hopeful the meeting would take place . the necessity of such a meeting took on new urgency after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was reported as telling turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan that iran was willing to " transfer nuclear know-how " to other islamic countries . " the islamic republic never seeks weapons of mass destruction and with respect to the needs of islamic countries , we are ready to transfer nuclear know-how to these countries , " the official iranian news agency .
irna , quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
observers say the offer is an attempt to strengthen backing for iran 's stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin french prime minister dominique de villepin " strongly " called for iran to keep its nuclear non-proliferation promises or face action before the security council . as a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran insists it is allowed to make nuclear fuel .

rice was cautious on prospects for seeking un action against the iranians when the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un nuclear watchdog , meets in vienna on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " if we get a referral -lrb- of iran -rrb- on sept .

" i 'm not so concerned about exactly when it happens because i do n't think this matter is so urgent that it has to be on sept .

rice said she saw no resistance from the europeans to taking the issue to the un security council .
iranians rejected a package of economic and security incentives offered by the europeans in exchange for the islamic republic renouncing its nuclear arms ambitions . " i still think that there is quite a bit of room and scope to put enough pressure on iran diplomatically to at least constrain iranian activities significantly , " rice said . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has urged the united states to give iran one last chance to halt suspected weapons-related nuclear activities , diplomats in vienna said wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win , dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran flouts europe and future negotiations un nuclear watchdog chief mohamed elbaradei met with iran 's new negotiator in vienna on friday as the islamic republic continues its brazen rhetoric .

18 ?
german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time . "
that meant there was room for the stock markets to fall back in disappointment . furthermore , many reform measures could actually have a negative effect on the economy and on the stock markets in the short term .
and the months of september and october were traditionally seen as the weakest for the equity markets , anyway , kleff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record high oil prices were another negative factor that could weigh on investor sentiment , raising the likelihood of a large-scale correction on the stock markets , he added . gra n d coalitio n n ot all bad hartiss said that a grand coalition need not be a recipe for policy paralysis . " history seems to suggest that a grand coalition is not all gloom and doom , " she said .
" arguably , the grand coalition of the late 1960s steered the economy out of a recession and implemented both financial and macro-economic reforms . " the best outcome would be the election of an effective administration committed to continue economic reform , " hartiss added .
" this may be almost as likely under a rejuvenated spd government as one led by a lacklustre cdu . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "
in 1954 , herberger , the german national soccer team 's coach , led his group to victory in the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger carried on the shoulders of german national soccer player in a film about the german 1954 soccer victory .
the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 . " he never had anything to do with ideologies , but he was willingly used for the inhuman ideology , " said niels havemann , the author of the first comprehensive book on the dfb 's role during the nazi era , adding that herberger cooperated with the nazis on a 1941 propaganda film called " das grosse spiel " -lrb- " the great game " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger in march 1977 , just a month before his death .
" unfortunately , a shadow is falling over sepp herberger , " said german sports minister otto schily during a presentation of the book , according to reuters news service .
" he let himself become part of the nazi propaganda . " hitler 's ig n ora n t backers dfb officials commissioned havemann , a historian at mainz university , to write the book , which is entitled " fussball unterm hakenkreuz " -lrb- " soccer under the swastika " -rrb- .
studying previously unknown documents from 40 archives in germany and abroad , havemann came to the conclusion that , like herberger , who was 80 when he died in 1977 , most dfb leaders did n't support the nazis out of conviction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havemann -lrb- left -rrb- , zwanziger -lrb- center -rrb- and schily during the book presentation instead , their thoughtlessness , ignorance , opportunism or professional ambition led them to support the hitler regime , making them accomplices to its system of oppression , persecution , war and destruction . " it 's perfectly clear that the dfb 's leadership was not part of the resistance , " said theo zwanziger , the current president of the dfb , which is the world 's largest single sport association .
" people did n't jump on the chances this popular sport would have offered to resist the regime at least a little . " sheddi n g light ahead of world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in light of next year 's world cup in germany , schily also said the book could answer questions many foreign visitors are bound to ask . " i can imagine a lot of visitors will be here and asking what happened between 1933 and 1945 , " he said .
" i think this will make an important contribution to those discussions . " a n award for tolera n ce dfb officials have meanwhile established an award in honor of former german national team player julius hirsch , who was killed by the nazis at auschwitz death camp . " with this award , we want to show that we think it 's everybody 's duty to stand up for our democratic and constitutional values , " zwanziger said .
" we want to use our position in society to promote freedom , tolerance and humanity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's players celebrate after winning the german soccer championship 2005 the first recipient of the award , which will be given to honor work against racism and xenophobia , is bayern munich .

18 ?
german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time . "
that meant there was room for the stock markets to fall back in disappointment . furthermore , many reform measures could actually have a negative effect on the economy and on the stock markets in the short term .
and the months of september and october were traditionally seen as the weakest for the equity markets , anyway , kleff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record high oil prices were another negative factor that could weigh on investor sentiment , raising the likelihood of a large-scale correction on the stock markets , he added . gra n d coalitio n n ot all bad hartiss said that a grand coalition need not be a recipe for policy paralysis . " history seems to suggest that a grand coalition is not all gloom and doom , " she said .
" arguably , the grand coalition of the late 1960s steered the economy out of a recession and implemented both financial and macro-economic reforms . " the best outcome would be the election of an effective administration committed to continue economic reform , " hartiss added .
" this may be almost as likely under a rejuvenated spd government as one led by a lacklustre cdu . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "
in 1954 , herberger , the german national soccer team 's coach , led his group to victory in the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger carried on the shoulders of german national soccer player in a film about the german 1954 soccer victory .
the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 . " he never had anything to do with ideologies , but he was willingly used for the inhuman ideology , " said niels havemann , the author of the first comprehensive book on the dfb 's role during the nazi era , adding that herberger cooperated with the nazis on a 1941 propaganda film called " das grosse spiel " -lrb- " the great game " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger in march 1977 , just a month before his death .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is due in new york thursday . " france is open to dialogue and a contact is possible if the iranians want it , " said a french diplomat on condition of anonymity , adding there was no confirmation at this stage . another european diplomat said he was hopeful the meeting would take place . the necessity of such a meeting took on new urgency after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was reported as telling turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan that iran was willing to " transfer nuclear know-how " to other islamic countries . " the islamic republic never seeks weapons of mass destruction and with respect to the needs of islamic countries , we are ready to transfer nuclear know-how to these countries , " the official iranian news agency .

" i 'm not so concerned about exactly when it happens because i do n't think this matter is so urgent that it has to be on sept .

rice said she saw no resistance from the europeans to taking the issue to the un security council .
iranians rejected a package of economic and security incentives offered by the europeans in exchange for the islamic republic renouncing its nuclear arms ambitions .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is due in new york thursday . " france is open to dialogue and a contact is possible if the iranians want it , " said a french diplomat on condition of anonymity , adding there was no confirmation at this stage . another european diplomat said he was hopeful the meeting would take place . the necessity of such a meeting took on new urgency after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was reported as telling turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan that iran was willing to " transfer nuclear know-how " to other islamic countries . " the islamic republic never seeks weapons of mass destruction and with respect to the needs of islamic countries , we are ready to transfer nuclear know-how to these countries , " the official iranian news agency .

observers say the offer is an attempt to strengthen backing for iran 's stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin french prime minister dominique de villepin " strongly " called for iran to keep its nuclear non-proliferation promises or face action before the security council . as a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran insists it is allowed to make nuclear fuel .

" i 'm not so concerned about exactly when it happens because i do n't think this matter is so urgent that it has to be on sept .

rice said she saw no resistance from the europeans to taking the issue to the un security council .
iranians rejected a package of economic and security incentives offered by the europeans in exchange for the islamic republic renouncing its nuclear arms ambitions . " i still think that there is quite a bit of room and scope to put enough pressure on iran diplomatically to at least constrain iranian activities significantly , " rice said . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has urged the united states to give iran one last chance to halt suspected weapons-related nuclear activities , diplomats in vienna said wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win , dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran flouts europe and future negotiations un nuclear watchdog chief mohamed elbaradei met with iran 's new negotiator in vienna on friday as the islamic republic continues its brazen rhetoric .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.09.2005 in digital age , a look to the stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music , music everywhere it was with much fanfare about the future of germany 's popular music industry that the 2005 popkomm festival opened in berlin .
on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio .

"

still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .
" i believe that there will be different solutions for different regions of the world . we believe that the diesel engine will continue to be the best solution for the european market , but the hybrid could be the alternative to the straight gasoline engine in north america . " another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years . " they recognize the success that toyota and lexus have had in the north american suv market and now they have to offer hybrids in order not to loose market share , " explained felix bauer , managing editor of germany 's automobilwoche . despite their late entry into the game , all of the major german player 's present at the frankfurt motor show echo the sentiments of wolfgang steiger , director of powertrain research at volkswagen : " the first hybrid cars came from japan , but it 's often true that the first is always the best ! we have been developing hybrid systems and we are pretty sure we can place a system in the market which meets or exceeds the japanese systems , but with less cost . " a wealth of suv 's bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an s-class mercedes-benz with a bluetec hybridmotor in order to enter the market as quickly as possible , german auto manufacturers have been establishing partnerships to reduce the significant development costs of installing these new component systems . in early september , bmw announced its plan to partner with daimlerchrysler and general motors to manufacture a hybrid drivetrain . shortly thereafter , audi , volkswagen and porsche also formed a partnership to develop a hybrid system for their suv lines - namely the vw touareg , the audi q7 and the porsche cayenne . as gas prices in the us continue to inch upward , americans who relish the space and performance of suv 's are turning to hybrid models to recoup a few precious gallons at the pump . for a country that is used to setting the precedent for innovation , felix bauer claims that germany is currently riding in the back seat .
" porsche always said that they would never make a hybrid , but now lexus has shown that they can make a very speedy hybrid engine . maybe this is a time for the germans to show that they have the engineering chops to compete .

fiery arsenal thun showdown the other group matches played wednesday saw european soccer heavyweights salvaging points against sides considered minnows of the champions league .
arsenal were spared the embarrassment of a 1-1 draw with swiss side thun wednesday .
thun , who beat dynamo kiev and malmö in the qualifying rounds , proved tenacious when nelson ferreira looped in an equaliser two minutes after arsenal 's opening goal , a header by brazilian midfielder gilberto silva after 51 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's fredrik ljungberg , front , collides with fc thun goalkeeper eldin jakupovic the london side was also reduced to 10 men just before the break with a red card shown to striker robin van persie for dangerous play .
arsenal then struggled to find further openings until 36-year-old substitute dennis bergkamp lobbed home the winner with his first champions league goal for three years .
van persie 's sending-off had arsenal club manager , arsene wenger fuming and ranting after yet another red card for his team .
" he -lrb- polish referee grzegorz gilewski -rrb- was flying high , he did n't watch the game , " the frenchman raged .
" the sending-off was an unpleasant surprise and the wrong decision .
it was not robin 's fault .
it was an accident .
for me , it was never a red card . "
thun boss urs schoenenberger was upset at the way bergkamp robbed them of a precious point at the death .
" i lost a point but if you consider where we played against whom we played , then this would have been the result you expected , " schoenenberger said .
" the way we lost is really disappointing , especially as we had one man more and we were holding them 1-1 right to the end .
but you ca n't say that inside we 're really torn apart . "
disappointment and relief lisbon club benfica scraped a 1-0 win over unheralded french side lille also in time added-on through a header from probably the smallest man on the pitch , fabrizio miccoli .
while lille coach claude puel bemoaned the lack of concentration from his young team his benfica counterpart koeman said that it had been the right result - as indeed he would do .
" we created more and wanted victory more .
this win was logical , " the former dutch international great said .

good night for italian clubs italian clubs had a good night as juventus recorded a 2-1 victory away at bruges with daviod trezeguet scoring his 100th goal for the club moving ever closer to french compatriot michel platini 's club record of 104 .
though juve 's french hardman midfielder patrick vieira too was given his marching orders in the final minute of the bruges match , trezeguet was jubiliant .
" it 's 100 goals , " said trezeguet .
" i 'm very proud of myself and my team-mates .
it 's part of the history of this club and it 's something exceptional . "
vincenzo iaquinta scored a hat-trick in udinese 's maiden champions league match as the unglamorous italian side recorded a 3-0 home victory over greek giants panathinaikos .
the good was balanced by the ugly as fiery england striker wayne rooney capped a pretty disastrous last 10 days for england and manchester united by being sent off for two bookable offences - the second for dissent at his initial booking - in united 's 0-0 away draw with spanish side villarreal .

on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio .

on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .

german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time . "
that meant there was room for the stock markets to fall back in disappointment . furthermore , many reform measures could actually have a negative effect on the economy and on the stock markets in the short term .
and the months of september and october were traditionally seen as the weakest for the equity markets , anyway , kleff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record high oil prices were another negative factor that could weigh on investor sentiment , raising the likelihood of a large-scale correction on the stock markets , he added . gra n d coalitio n n ot all bad hartiss said that a grand coalition need not be a recipe for policy paralysis . " history seems to suggest that a grand coalition is not all gloom and doom , " she said .
" arguably , the grand coalition of the late 1960s steered the economy out of a recession and implemented both financial and macro-economic reforms . " the best outcome would be the election of an effective administration committed to continue economic reform , " hartiss added .
" this may be almost as likely under a rejuvenated spd government as one led by a lacklustre cdu . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .

but , barca was then made to sweat as bremen battered the star team with relentless attacking .
but , deprived of german forward miroslav klose through suspension , bremen saw a succession of chances wasted as ivan klasnic and nelson valdez gave their best but failed to score .
a penalty kick by ronaldinho in the second half helped barcelona drive in the final nail into bremen 's flagging game and romp to victory .
bildunterschrift : nelson valdez , left , frank baumann , centre , and barcelona 's xavi , right , challenge for the ball barcelona coach frank rijkaard said he was satisfied with the way his side had performed .
" i 'm happy , " rijkard said .
" if you just count the number of chances you could see it could have been a different result but we scored twice against a very strong team at their ground so of course i 'm happy , " he said .
" we suffered , they played very well but you have to score goals to get a win or come from behind to get a draw . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf admitted his team 's failings .
" they took their chances and we did n't , " he said .
" we invested a lot in this game , running and fighting for everything , but we come away with nothing , " schaf said .
" i would have liked to get something , even just one goal . "
fiery arsenal thun showdown the other group matches played wednesday saw european soccer heavyweights salvaging points against sides considered minnows of the champions league .
arsenal were spared the embarrassment of a 1-1 draw with swiss side thun wednesday .
thun , who beat dynamo kiev and malmö in the qualifying rounds , proved tenacious when nelson ferreira looped in an equaliser two minutes after arsenal 's opening goal , a header by brazilian midfielder gilberto silva after 51 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's fredrik ljungberg , front , collides with fc thun goalkeeper eldin jakupovic the london side was also reduced to 10 men just before the break with a red card shown to striker robin van persie for dangerous play .
arsenal then struggled to find further openings until 36-year-old substitute dennis bergkamp lobbed home the winner with his first champions league goal for three years .
van persie 's sending-off had arsenal club manager , arsene wenger fuming and ranting after yet another red card for his team .
" he -lrb- polish referee grzegorz gilewski -rrb- was flying high , he did n't watch the game , " the frenchman raged .
" the sending-off was an unpleasant surprise and the wrong decision .
it was not robin 's fault .
it was an accident .
for me , it was never a red card . "
thun boss urs schoenenberger was upset at the way bergkamp robbed them of a precious point at the death .
" i lost a point but if you consider where we played against whom we played , then this would have been the result you expected , " schoenenberger said .
" the way we lost is really disappointing , especially as we had one man more and we were holding them 1-1 right to the end .
but you ca n't say that inside we 're really torn apart . "
disappointment and relief lisbon club benfica scraped a 1-0 win over unheralded french side lille also in time added-on through a header from probably the smallest man on the pitch , fabrizio miccoli .
while lille coach claude puel bemoaned the lack of concentration from his young team his benfica counterpart koeman said that it had been the right result - as indeed he would do .
" we created more and wanted victory more .
this win was logical , " the former dutch international great said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin petras , left , and zdenek pospech , right , both of sparta , challenge for a ball with markus rosenberg , center , of ajax there was also to be last-minute disappointment for czech republic outfit sparta prague as they were held 1-1 at home by dutch giants ajax - a club formerly managed by benfica 's handler ronald koeman - with wesley sneijder 's stunning effort giving them a point .
good night for italian clubs italian clubs had a good night as juventus recorded a 2-1 victory away at bruges with daviod trezeguet scoring his 100th goal for the club moving ever closer to french compatriot michel platini 's club record of 104 .
though juve 's french hardman midfielder patrick vieira too was given his marching orders in the final minute of the bruges match , trezeguet was jubiliant .
" it 's 100 goals , " said trezeguet .
" i 'm very proud of myself and my team-mates .
it 's part of the history of this club and it 's something exceptional . "

on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio .

but , barca was then made to sweat as bremen battered the star team with relentless attacking .
but , deprived of german forward miroslav klose through suspension , bremen saw a succession of chances wasted as ivan klasnic and nelson valdez gave their best but failed to score .
a penalty kick by ronaldinho in the second half helped barcelona drive in the final nail into bremen 's flagging game and romp to victory .
bildunterschrift : nelson valdez , left , frank baumann , centre , and barcelona 's xavi , right , challenge for the ball barcelona coach frank rijkaard said he was satisfied with the way his side had performed .
" i 'm happy , " rijkard said .
" if you just count the number of chances you could see it could have been a different result but we scored twice against a very strong team at their ground so of course i 'm happy , " he said .
" we suffered , they played very well but you have to score goals to get a win or come from behind to get a draw . "
bremen coach thomas schaaf admitted his team 's failings .
" they took their chances and we did n't , " he said .
" we invested a lot in this game , running and fighting for everything , but we come away with nothing , " schaf said .
" i would have liked to get something , even just one goal . "
fiery arsenal thun showdown the other group matches played wednesday saw european soccer heavyweights salvaging points against sides considered minnows of the champions league .
arsenal were spared the embarrassment of a 1-1 draw with swiss side thun wednesday .
thun , who beat dynamo kiev and malmö in the qualifying rounds , proved tenacious when nelson ferreira looped in an equaliser two minutes after arsenal 's opening goal , a header by brazilian midfielder gilberto silva after 51 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's fredrik ljungberg , front , collides with fc thun goalkeeper eldin jakupovic the london side was also reduced to 10 men just before the break with a red card shown to striker robin van persie for dangerous play .
arsenal then struggled to find further openings until 36-year-old substitute dennis bergkamp lobbed home the winner with his first champions league goal for three years .
van persie 's sending-off had arsenal club manager , arsene wenger fuming and ranting after yet another red card for his team .
" he -lrb- polish referee grzegorz gilewski -rrb- was flying high , he did n't watch the game , " the frenchman raged .
" the sending-off was an unpleasant surprise and the wrong decision .
it was not robin 's fault .
it was an accident .
for me , it was never a red card . "
thun boss urs schoenenberger was upset at the way bergkamp robbed them of a precious point at the death .
" i lost a point but if you consider where we played against whom we played , then this would have been the result you expected , " schoenenberger said .
" the way we lost is really disappointing , especially as we had one man more and we were holding them 1-1 right to the end .
but you ca n't say that inside we 're really torn apart . "
disappointment and relief lisbon club benfica scraped a 1-0 win over unheralded french side lille also in time added-on through a header from probably the smallest man on the pitch , fabrizio miccoli .
while lille coach claude puel bemoaned the lack of concentration from his young team his benfica counterpart koeman said that it had been the right result - as indeed he would do .
" we created more and wanted victory more .
this win was logical , " the former dutch international great said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin petras , left , and zdenek pospech , right , both of sparta , challenge for a ball with markus rosenberg , center , of ajax there was also to be last-minute disappointment for czech republic outfit sparta prague as they were held 1-1 at home by dutch giants ajax - a club formerly managed by benfica 's handler ronald koeman - with wesley sneijder 's stunning effort giving them a point .
good night for italian clubs italian clubs had a good night as juventus recorded a 2-1 victory away at bruges with daviod trezeguet scoring his 100th goal for the club moving ever closer to french compatriot michel platini 's club record of 104 .
though juve 's french hardman midfielder patrick vieira too was given his marching orders in the final minute of the bruges match , trezeguet was jubiliant .
" it 's 100 goals , " said trezeguet .
" i 'm very proud of myself and my team-mates .
it 's part of the history of this club and it 's something exceptional . "
vincenzo iaquinta scored a hat-trick in udinese 's maiden champions league match as the unglamorous italian side recorded a 3-0 home victory over greek giants panathinaikos .
the good was balanced by the ugly as fiery england striker wayne rooney capped a pretty disastrous last 10 days for england and manchester united by being sent off for two bookable offences - the second for dissent at his initial booking - in united 's 0-0 away draw with spanish side villarreal .

"
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .

" another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years .

"
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .

while dfb leaders were n't ardent hitler supporters , they played along as opportunists . for decades , most germans have associated the name sepp herberger with the so-called " miracle of berne . "
in 1954 , herberger , the german national soccer team 's coach , led his group to victory in the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : herberger carried on the shoulders of german national soccer player in a film about the german 1954 soccer victory .
the win created a sense of euphoria in postwar germany and is credited with playing a large role in the country 's economic recovery . but herberger 's career did n't start in 1945 .
he joined the nazi party just a few months after hitler came to power in 1933 and became national coach in 1937 .

18 ?
german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time . "

german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time .

a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time . "
that meant there was room for the stock markets to fall back in disappointment . furthermore , many reform measures could actually have a negative effect on the economy and on the stock markets in the short term .
and the months of september and october were traditionally seen as the weakest for the equity markets , anyway , kleff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record high oil prices were another negative factor that could weigh on investor sentiment , raising the likelihood of a large-scale correction on the stock markets , he added . gra n d coalitio n n ot all bad hartiss said that a grand coalition need not be a recipe for policy paralysis . " history seems to suggest that a grand coalition is not all gloom and doom , " she said .
" arguably , the grand coalition of the late 1960s steered the economy out of a recession and implemented both financial and macro-economic reforms . " the best outcome would be the election of an effective administration committed to continue economic reform , " hartiss added .
" this may be almost as likely under a rejuvenated spd government as one led by a lacklustre cdu . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .

18 ?
german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time . "
that meant there was room for the stock markets to fall back in disappointment . furthermore , many reform measures could actually have a negative effect on the economy and on the stock markets in the short term .
and the months of september and october were traditionally seen as the weakest for the equity markets , anyway , kleff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record high oil prices were another negative factor that could weigh on investor sentiment , raising the likelihood of a large-scale correction on the stock markets , he added . gra n d coalitio n n ot all bad hartiss said that a grand coalition need not be a recipe for policy paralysis . " history seems to suggest that a grand coalition is not all gloom and doom , " she said .
" arguably , the grand coalition of the late 1960s steered the economy out of a recession and implemented both financial and macro-economic reforms . " the best outcome would be the election of an effective administration committed to continue economic reform , " hartiss added .
" this may be almost as likely under a rejuvenated spd government as one led by a lacklustre cdu . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social justice or economic folly ?

german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .

18 ?
german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .
a cdu-led government , with a majority in both the upper and lower houses of german parliament " is clearly the markets ' preferred outcome , " hartiss said . a merkel-led administration was perceived to have the more business-friendly agenda , targeting increased flexibility of the labor markets , less bureaucracy , a simplified tax system and incentives to raise direct foreign investment . and with majorities in both bundestag and bundesrat , merkel would be better able to push through her program of economic reforms . ce n ter-left has made a de n t however , a re-election of schröder and his ruling coalition of spd and the environmentalist greens would not necessarily be the disaster that many market players feared it would be , hartiss argued . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles on the trading floor " after all , the economy has begun to turn around under spd management , " she said . " it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time . "
that meant there was room for the stock markets to fall back in disappointment . furthermore , many reform measures could actually have a negative effect on the economy and on the stock markets in the short term .
and the months of september and october were traditionally seen as the weakest for the equity markets , anyway , kleff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record high oil prices were another negative factor that could weigh on investor sentiment , raising the likelihood of a large-scale correction on the stock markets , he added . gra n d coalitio n n ot all bad hartiss said that a grand coalition need not be a recipe for policy paralysis . " history seems to suggest that a grand coalition is not all gloom and doom , " she said .
" arguably , the grand coalition of the late 1960s steered the economy out of a recession and implemented both financial and macro-economic reforms . " the best outcome would be the election of an effective administration committed to continue economic reform , " hartiss added .

on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .

hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !

home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?

artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .
the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is due in new york thursday . " france is open to dialogue and a contact is possible if the iranians want it , " said a french diplomat on condition of anonymity , adding there was no confirmation at this stage . another european diplomat said he was hopeful the meeting would take place . the necessity of such a meeting took on new urgency after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was reported as telling turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan that iran was willing to " transfer nuclear know-how " to other islamic countries . " the islamic republic never seeks weapons of mass destruction and with respect to the needs of islamic countries , we are ready to transfer nuclear know-how to these countries , " the official iranian news agency .

" i 'm not so concerned about exactly when it happens because i do n't think this matter is so urgent that it has to be on sept .

rice said she saw no resistance from the europeans to taking the issue to the un security council .
iranians rejected a package of economic and security incentives offered by the europeans in exchange for the islamic republic renouncing its nuclear arms ambitions . " i still think that there is quite a bit of room and scope to put enough pressure on iran diplomatically to at least constrain iranian activities significantly , " rice said . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has urged the united states to give iran one last chance to halt suspected weapons-related nuclear activities , diplomats in vienna said wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win , dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran flouts europe and future negotiations un nuclear watchdog chief mohamed elbaradei met with iran 's new negotiator in vienna on friday as the islamic republic continues its brazen rhetoric .

fiery arsenal thun showdown the other group matches played wednesday saw european soccer heavyweights salvaging points against sides considered minnows of the champions league .
arsenal were spared the embarrassment of a 1-1 draw with swiss side thun wednesday .
thun , who beat dynamo kiev and malmö in the qualifying rounds , proved tenacious when nelson ferreira looped in an equaliser two minutes after arsenal 's opening goal , a header by brazilian midfielder gilberto silva after 51 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's fredrik ljungberg , front , collides with fc thun goalkeeper eldin jakupovic the london side was also reduced to 10 men just before the break with a red card shown to striker robin van persie for dangerous play .
arsenal then struggled to find further openings until 36-year-old substitute dennis bergkamp lobbed home the winner with his first champions league goal for three years .
van persie 's sending-off had arsenal club manager , arsene wenger fuming and ranting after yet another red card for his team .
" he -lrb- polish referee grzegorz gilewski -rrb- was flying high , he did n't watch the game , " the frenchman raged .
" the sending-off was an unpleasant surprise and the wrong decision .
it was not robin 's fault .
it was an accident .
for me , it was never a red card . "
thun boss urs schoenenberger was upset at the way bergkamp robbed them of a precious point at the death .
" i lost a point but if you consider where we played against whom we played , then this would have been the result you expected , " schoenenberger said .
" the way we lost is really disappointing , especially as we had one man more and we were holding them 1-1 right to the end .
but you ca n't say that inside we 're really torn apart . "
disappointment and relief lisbon club benfica scraped a 1-0 win over unheralded french side lille also in time added-on through a header from probably the smallest man on the pitch , fabrizio miccoli .
while lille coach claude puel bemoaned the lack of concentration from his young team his benfica counterpart koeman said that it had been the right result - as indeed he would do .
" we created more and wanted victory more .
this win was logical , " the former dutch international great said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.09.2005 germans rush to tap hybrid market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi q7 hybrid , one of germany 's new concept cars spurred on by soaring fuel prices , german carmakers bmw , audi , volkswagen and porsche have announced plans to offer hybrid vehicles by 2008 . at this year 's iaa international motor show in frankfurt , words like " hybrid " and " biodiesel " were almost as sexy as " convertible " or " super-sport . "
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .
this price surge has created a boom market for vehicles with high fuel efficiency , such as hybrids , or with alternative fuel systems . two hearts beating as one the actual " hybrid " part of these new engines pertains to the fact that the drivetrain is powered by both a gasoline combustion engine and an electric motor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi 's q7 is powered by both a v8 engine and an electric motor that gives it extra power during acceleration to be more efficient , a hybrid engine simply relies on basic laws of physics , namely , that an object in motion not only requires energy to maintain its velocity - but it also creates energy .
a moving car creates energy by doing things like breaking -lrb- which gives off heat -rrb- as well as coasting down hills .
in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .

in a hybrid automobile this energy is captured and stored in a battery , which in turn powers the electric motor .
the electric motor is then used to support the gasoline engine during acceleration . actual fuel efficiencies gained by driving a hybrid vary depending on the type of driving the car is used for .
when driving in a city with a lot of stop-and-go , fuel savings can be quite significant - up to 50 percent .
this savings starts to decrease the longer the car is driven without breaking . so , a long road trip on a highway would provide no additional efficiency . diesel still preferred in europe one obvious explanation for the reluctance of the german 's to immediately jump on the hybrid bandwagon is that european car buyers already have a fuel-efficient alternative on the market - the good old diesel engine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche cayenne on it 's way to the united states " hybrid and diesel , we do n't really see a difference between them , " explained marius lehne , project manager for audis ' new q7 hybrid concept car .

" another reason europeans are wary of pushing hybrids for their domestic market stems from infrastructural differences between american and european cities . since hybrid cars are designed for low speed stop-and-go city traffic , they might not be popular in european cities where people tend to rely on public transportation rather than driving . a game of catch-up despite the fact that both audi and vw have been researching hybrid technology for over 15 years - audi even tested an a4-hybrid in europe in 1997 - all of the major german carmakers have been left in the proverbial dust by japanese hybrid models that have been on us car lots for well over two years .

"
still , you would n't notice it by driving down the autobahn or checking out the cars on the streets of wolfsburg or munich , but sales of hybrid vehicles - especially in north america - are starting to raise a few eyebrows among german carmakers . maybe the germans are n't feeling the hurt at the gas pump as much as americans are these days since gas has always been expensive in europe , almost three times that of the united states .
these days , however , with the average price of petrol in north america doubling over the past 12 months , the margin between europe and the us has narrowed considerably .

german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .

" it would be ironic if schröder were to pay the electoral price for the short-term costs of economic reforms he has implemented just as the long-term benefits are starting to come through , " as demonstrated by recent unemployment and industrial output data , hartiss added . furthermore , a cdu victory would still carry risks , such as the prospect of increased social tensions and the likelihood of a rise in sales tax , she added . short term vs. lo n g term zew 's kleff also pointed out that a cdu-led government would not be able to overhaul the german economy completely " in a short space of time .

german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel was once set for a decisive win in elections next sunday .
but her lead has evaporated , taking with it some stock market confidence . support for current chancellor gerhard schröder and his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has bounced back , slashing the conservative cdu / csu parties ' lead in half .
and while schröder is still unlikely to secure an overall victory , there does appear to be a chance that merkel will be forced into an uneasy power-sharing deal with the spd . with schröder bouncing back in the polls , it is hardly surprising that investors are getting nervous . the reason for the powerful surge in the german dax stock index in recent months had been renewed interest on the part of anglo-saxon investors , who hoped that a comfortable majority for a new government under merkel would provide fresh impetus for much-needed economic reforms , said the financial markets expert of the zew think-tank in mannheim , volker kleff . markets wa n t merkel a n d cdu capital economics analyst lucy hartiss agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax has been performing well , largely on anticipation of a change in government .

on the agenda were the renaissance of the concert landscape and the success of german music . berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit set the tone for the coming days in his opening address .
" i 'm delighted that the music industry in germany is on the up and up , " he said .
" i think the hard times are over and i hope popkomm will get the message out there that it 's worth investing in german groups . "
even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .
and that , says raik hölzel of the indie german label , kitty-yo , is the way it should be .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , silbermond , in concert " more is being made of the festival going on in tandem with the trade fair , and the live-performance aspect is being taken more seriously by the media , " he said with a sense of relief .
" live acts are becoming much more important , as concerts are an incredibly important tool in the marketing of music . "
live is king make no mistake about that .
for all its sleek beauty and micro-chip capabilities , the digital age has played havoc with artists ' earning power .
with many consumers preferring to copy music than actually go out and buy it , even the most popular musicians can no longer rely on cd sales to keep them in their old age .
they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .
" the situation has really changed , people want to see music being made , and its not just about entertainment , but about transporting feelings , " hölzel said .
" they 're not looking for a perfect sound , but for emotions and dirty , direct , confrontational music . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popkomm 2005 things have gone full circle since the seventies , when record companies such as crysalis , virgin and island records were born out of the live industry .
now live is king again , bands release albums just so they can go on tour to promote them , and record companies who are feeling the pinch are looking at getting back into the live side of the industry .
getting the good gigs but it 's a competitive business .
jens michow , president of the national association of the events industry -lrb- idkv -rrb- , says there are as many as a thousand events organizers operating in germany and hundreds of them are competing for the same gigs .
" if artists make the bulk of their money through the live music industry , then of course they look around to see which event organizer will give them the best deal .
and that is unfortunately reflected in ticket prices , " michow said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live experience even at anything from 30 euros -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- to 75 euros -lrb- $ 92 -rrb- a pop , the cost of tickets are not outlandish enough to scare audiences away .
hölzel says the new trend in stage performance will stick around for a while , not least because it ’ s a whole new thing for a whole lot of people .
" the generation which grew up with techno have n't really had that experience .
i 've heard a lot of kids saying ' wow !
that 's a bass drum ?
i know what a bass drum sounds like from my computer , but i did n't know they existed as real instruments , " ' he said .
home-grown success and while the hip young things are revelling in the revelation of where music really comes from , the germans who make it are enjoying their own little slice of success .
since last year , when it was decreed that radio air time should dedicate a certain portion of its time to german language music , interest in the domestic music sector appears to have been on the increase .
artists like wir sind helden , silbermond , jeanette biedermann , nena and juli all trill in their native tongue and receive a lot of praise for their efforts .
thus far , the biggest chart toppers of 2005 in both the singles and album charts have been indigenous artists .
so why the sudden loyalty ?
" the music industry is susceptible to trends .
for a long time it was the case that artists thought they could only be successful if they wrote and sang in english .
those times are over now .
german lyrics are successful and people like to hear them , " said michow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german band , wir sind helden but hölzel says there is more to the german music scene that artists whose popularity might have been affected by the introduction of air-time quotas .
he says the music scene in berlin is a hotbed of creative energy which generates great quantities of interesting music .
" people want to create something special , they 're not primarily interested in making money , but want to make something that can influence other people .
that music should be taken more seriously by radio stations in germany , hölzel said .
" the audience is out there looking for that music , and eventually word gets out , but it has nothing to do with what gets played on the radio .

even if that message has n't penetrated the international psyche just yet , berlin is certainly drawing attention to itself as a place where the music scene is alive , kicking and full of innovation .
some 800 exhibitors have flown in from abroad to be a part of popkomm , and over the coming few days the german capital will host 400 hours of live music in clubs and venues across the city .

they have to get out on the stage and sweat for their supper .
the interesting thing is that this necessity on the part of the artists appears to be coupled with a desire on the side of audiences to get a taste of the real mccoy .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is due in new york thursday . " france is open to dialogue and a contact is possible if the iranians want it , " said a french diplomat on condition of anonymity , adding there was no confirmation at this stage . another european diplomat said he was hopeful the meeting would take place . the necessity of such a meeting took on new urgency after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was reported as telling turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan that iran was willing to " transfer nuclear know-how " to other islamic countries . " the islamic republic never seeks weapons of mass destruction and with respect to the needs of islamic countries , we are ready to transfer nuclear know-how to these countries , " the official iranian news agency .
irna , quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
observers say the offer is an attempt to strengthen backing for iran 's stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister dominique de villepin french prime minister dominique de villepin " strongly " called for iran to keep its nuclear non-proliferation promises or face action before the security council . as a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , iran insists it is allowed to make nuclear fuel .
president ahmadinejad took a swipe at un members who felt their wealth and power gave them " extended rights " not accorded to other countries . rice : may n ot have votes as washington lobbied china , india , russia and other countries to back referral of iran to the un security council for resuming sensitive nuclear activities , us secretary of state condoleezza rice signaled washington may not have the votes at a key meeting next week .
rice was cautious on prospects for seeking un action against the iranians when the board of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the un nuclear watchdog , meets in vienna on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " if we get a referral -lrb- of iran -rrb- on sept .

" i 'm not so concerned about exactly when it happens because i do n't think this matter is so urgent that it has to be on sept .

rice said she saw no resistance from the europeans to taking the issue to the un security council .
iranians rejected a package of economic and security incentives offered by the europeans in exchange for the islamic republic renouncing its nuclear arms ambitions . " i still think that there is quite a bit of room and scope to put enough pressure on iran diplomatically to at least constrain iranian activities significantly , " rice said . iaea chief mohamed elbaradei has urged the united states to give iran one last chance to halt suspected weapons-related nuclear activities , diplomats in vienna said wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win , dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran flouts europe and future negotiations un nuclear watchdog chief mohamed elbaradei met with iran 's new negotiator in vienna on friday as the islamic republic continues its brazen rhetoric .

a new heart and lung centre in wolverhampton is to treat around 50 patients from swansea from next month .
a smaller group of 15 patients is also to undergo cardiac surgery in bristol .
health commission wales said patients were being offered treatment at english hospitals so they do not have to wait longer than the maximum waiting times .
the current target set down by the welsh assembly government for patients to receive cardiac surgery is eight months .
andrew bellamy , director of service strategy and modernisation at swansea nhs trust , said the trust was delivering on its contract for cardiac surgery patients , but did not have the capacity to meet the assembly targets .
it makes sense to offer free capacity at wolverhampton and bristol to patients who want to avail of it health commission wales spokesperson that is why the health commission wales , an executive agency of the assembly government , had negotiated the contract with the english hospitals .
he did not have figures available for the numbers of patients being treated in the swansea nhs trust area but said there was an " increasing workload " for cardiac surgery .
" this is not happening because of any failure on our part to deliver , " said mr bellamy .
" we have got an agreed level of activity and we are delivering on that . "
the wolverhampton heart and lung centre fought off competition from two other trusts to win the contract .
the centre opened last october but has since become underused because techniques have changed .
transport and accommodation david loughton , chief executive of the royal wolverhampton hospitals nhs trust , said : " this agreement is excellent news for the people of wolverhampton and for the people of wales . "
a health commission wales spokesperson said arranging specialist contracts for patients outside of wales was a tried and tested way of working which has proved successful .
" heart patients from the swansea area are being offered treatment at hospitals in wolverhampton and bristol so that they do not have to wait longer than the maximum waiting times which apply across wales .
" transport is arranged for the patient as well as accommodation for relatives when required , " added the spokesperson .
the position in swansea was under review " but in the meantime it makes sense to offer free capacity at wolverhampton and bristol to patients who want to avail of it . "

the wolverhampton heart and lung centre fought off competition from two other trusts to win the contract .
the centre opened last october but has since become underused because techniques have changed .
transport and accommodation david loughton , chief executive of the royal wolverhampton hospitals nhs trust , said : " this agreement is excellent news for the people of wolverhampton and for the people of wales . "
a health commission wales spokesperson said arranging specialist contracts for patients outside of wales was a tried and tested way of working which has proved successful .
" heart patients from the swansea area are being offered treatment at hospitals in wolverhampton and bristol so that they do not have to wait longer than the maximum waiting times which apply across wales .
" transport is arranged for the patient as well as accommodation for relatives when required , " added the spokesperson .
the position in swansea was under review " but in the meantime it makes sense to offer free capacity at wolverhampton and bristol to patients who want to avail of it . "

news that former president dafydd wigley was to succeed the late gwynfor evans as honorary president dominated the news earlier this week .
then plaid chair john dixon castigated some of his own members for alleged plotting against the leadership .
he laid down the law after reports that some wanted another former president , dafydd elis-thomas , back at the helm .
rather than going to an area where the party did well , plaid is in its wisdom staging the annual meeting in the very seat it should have kept the theme of this year 's conference is " for all our futures " .
the english-language theme is actually slightly different to the one which appears in welsh .
when translated , the welsh theme reads " our future " .
i can almost hear the cynical amongst you whispering " what future ? "
in the headlines : dafydd elis thomas and his party plaid cymru has , rather oddly , chosen aberystwyth for its annual meeting .
the party lost the seat of ceredigion which included the university seaside town at may 's general election - a bitter pill to swallow .
but rather than going to an area where the party did well , plaid is in its wisdom staging the annual meeting in the very seat it should have kept .
imagine new labour electing to build a statute to tony blair in the blaenau gwent town of ebbw vale , or napoleon returning to waterloo to celebrate his birthday .
the period following this year 's may elections has been truly disastrous for plaid cymru as it lurched from one self-inflicted debacle to the next .
there was the fiasco over pwllheli marina which raised serious questions about president dafydd iwan 's political judgement .
then there were the unkind comments about his own party from lord elis-thomas during the national eisteddfod .
big stick then to cap it all there was the catfight with labour following a leak by the governing party of an internal document which suggested that plaid was contemplating a series of spectacular u-turns on a number of core policies .
once the electorate , the membership and the media begin to question a party 's credibility is when the slide begins in earnest .
remember what happened to labour in 1983 and to the conservatives in 1997 ?
lord elis-thomas has criticised the party in recent years plaid 's internal difficulties have been manna to welsh labour and to the welsh liberal democrats , both of whom who hope to capitalise if the discord continues .
if labour learned nothing else in the run-up to 1997 , it is that credibility depends on disciplined unanimity .
tories are painfully learning the same lesson .
it can be no coincidence that plaid chair john dixon waves the big stick in his introduction to the 2005 conference .
" the closer we get to form the government of wales , the more we need to become cohesive and clear in the way we work and the messages we give out " one reason for plaid 's disappointing result in may , was that there was and remains disagreement on what its core message should be .
if , for instance , plaid no longer stands for home rule and self-government , then what does it stand for ?
on thursday its honorary president-to-be , dafydd wigley , addresses a meeting on the conference fringe .
many within the party still regard the former member for caernarfonshire as the " prince across the water " and the content and the nuances of his message will undoubtedly be debated in the bars into the wee small hours .
as a teetotaller , i shall also be there .
mineral water in one hand and notepad in the other , i shall be listening with great interest to what he and they have to say .

when harry 's father was first interviewed in 1969 , before his investiture as prince of wales , the today programme presenter travelled to buckingham palace .

" just call me harry " .
these four words capture one of the many challenges facing the young prince , who at 21 , is now fully embracing adult life .
for now there is no " your royal highness " , no " sir " .
but even though he does not have a destiny to fulfil , he is third-in-line to the throne .
like his brother , william , he wants to be normal , though in his heart of hearts , he must know it is an , at times , unattainable dream .
" normal " 21-year-olds are not interviewed by three reporters to mark the occasion .
the interviews give a flavour of how harry , the party prince , the caring prince - he says he happily embraces both titles - is trying to navigate his way in the world as a modern royal .
over the years such interviews , which are given to all the broadcasters and newspapers , have been a mechanism by which royal officials attempt to project a particular image of whichever family member is in the spotlight . "
harry 's clearly keen to present a more rounded picture of himself - to move away from the two-dimensional character of a prince out on the town " though controlled affairs , they do also provide some insight .
when harry 's father was first interviewed in 1969 , before his investiture as prince of wales , the today programme presenter travelled to buckingham palace .
it can be assumed the queen 's eldest son may well have worn a tie and a double-breasted suit for the occasion .
he certainly did when he was interviewed for television around the same time .
when harry met the bbc , there was not a tie in sight .
his crumpled shirt showed no evidence of the famed skill sandhurst cadets are said to have for ironing .
rounded picture when gently teased about his attire , he was embarrassed and said he 'd been told to go casual .
a modern prince for a modern age .
the encounters were not unduly lengthy , but they gave harry time to set out his stall .
harry 's clearly keen to present a more rounded picture of himself - to move away from the two-dimensional character of a prince out on the town .
recent events have helped to fuel this stereotype .
he was involved in a scuffle with a paparazzi photographer and he wore that now notorious fancy dress costume - a nazi uniform and a swastika armband . "
those around harry are protective of him - he can sometimes appear vulnerable . "
he has used these interviews to apologise again , this time in public - something some politicians had demanded at the time the offending picture was published .
" it was , " says harry , " a stupid thing to do .
i would prefer to put it in the past if i can . "
looking to the future , harry 's life , as currently mapped out , will be devoted to army service and a continuation of his charitable work in southern africa .
he is determined to achieve both those goals .
working with the children of lesotho who 've been blighted by aids fulfils his pledge to sustain his mother 's legacy .
heartfelt comments there is another aspect of his life which is more problematic - his relationship with his girlfriend chelsy davy .
she will presumably be touched by the warm , heartfelt comments he 's made about her .

abn amro had been up against local bank banca popolare italiana -lrb- bpi -rrb- , which owned 29.5 % of lender antonveneta .
bpi looked to have won the tussle , but its bid was frozen amid accusations of illegal share trades and collusion that reached as far as the bank of italy .
abn amro would become the first foreign bank to buy a major italian lender .
bpi said it had agreed to sell its shares for 26.50 euros each , more than antonveneta 's closing price of 26.09 euros on wednesday .
the deal would value antonveneta at close to 7.6bn euros -lrb- £ 5.1bn ; $ 9.3bn -rrb- .
following the purchase , abn amro will own almost 60 % of antonveneta .
" bpi has has announced their intention to sell , obviously we have the intention to buy from them , " an abn amro spokeman said .
" things are moving in the right direction but the agreement has yet to be signed . "

however , they have found it difficult to break into the market and italy has been accused of protectionism .
this view was given some credence when antonio fazio , the powerful governor of the bank of italy , was recorded talking to the chief executive of bpi about the bidding for antonveneta .
mr fazio has denied any wrongdoing and is resisting calls for his resignation .
by the time the recordings surfaced , questions already had been raised over how bpi managed to build up its stake in antonveneta and financial watchdog consob decided it should suspend the bid pending an investigation .
abn amro quietly reiterated its interest in taking control of antonveneta , and the dutch lender 's patience seems to have paid off .
the deal is expected to be finalised on 21 september .

in may , chairman of the governing spd social democratic party franz muntefering was given a beating in a local election by workers angry at the way jobs were being moved to cheaper countries and worried about the erosion of workers ' rights .
seeing the writing on the wall , mr muntefering had tried to blame foreign private equity investors for germany 's economic ills , labelling them " locusts " who were asset stripping companies , sparking large job losses in the process .
a plan by grohe water technology to cut thousands of jobs and move production to china made matters worse for mr muntefering .
not only because the kitchen and bathroom fittings manufacturer 's home town hemer lies within his electoral district .
but also because grohe is owned by two private equity firms , tpg -lrb- texas pacific group -rrb- and csfb -lrb- credit suisse first boston -rrb- .
" the company planned to cut 3,200 jobs -lsb- from its workforce of about 4,500 -rsb- , based on a proposal by the consultants mckinsey , " says regional ig metall union representative joerg weigand .
this , says mr weigand , would have ended grohe 's industrial production in germany and dealt a devastating blow to the people of hemer , who have even named their town square grohe platz .
union victory the manufacturer 's plan sparked a savage response from german unions as it came to be seen as a symbol of what is wrong with the way the country 's troubled economy is managed .
there was no plan b until ig metall came up with one ralf bartel , dgb trade union federation yet , rather than launching industrial action , ig metall proposed a compromise - accepting almost 1,000 job cuts and one factory closure , in return for fresh investment at remaining german factories to secure future employment .
grohe - wary of negative publicity - swiftly took the union 's recommendations onboard and sorted out the dispute internally .
there was praise for ig metall 's efforts in the dispute and the union 's membership , which had been slipping steadily for years , was given a much needed fillip .
" it is always difficult to call it a victory when several hundred jobs are lost , but compared with the alternative it was a victory , " insists mr weigand .
but there was no such luck for chancellor schroeder who was left with the precarious media balancing act of mollifying the unions as well as calming the fears of international investors , wary about his party colleague 's anti-capitalist rhetoric .
control issues underlying it all was a philosophical debate about control - who should be in charge of german industry and decide how companies should be run .
originally grohe 's german factory faced closure ralf bartel , of the german trade union federation dgb , believes unions and workers are often better than managers and owners at making the right decisions .
from an anglo-saxon point of view , there may be little rhyme or reason behind such a view .
but consider this : ig metall 's response to grohe 's plan was to hire what it describes as " better consultants " to pick apart the mckinsey report and hammer out an alternative plan that would both improve efficiency and safeguard hundreds of jobs .
mckinsey had not taken into account the value of existing know-how among grohe 's workers , the cost of moving to china , potential damage to the trademark of moving out of the made in germany zone , and the possibility of increasing productivity at existing plants by 30 % .
" there was no plan b until ig metall came up with one . "
balancing act grohe 's director of labour affairs detlef spigiel is keen to downplay the importance of the mckinsey report and insists the firm never intended to go along with all its recommendations .
instead it aimed to achieve " the right balance between added value and sales , and that is the reason why we must shift some production to asia and the nafta area " .
only 20 % of grohe 's sales are in germany , so it wants to reduce the proportion of production in germany from 80 % to 60 % - still high when compared with the car industry for example , mr spigiel says .
skilled workers are strong supporters of trade unions product development , design and research , as well as the firm 's head office will remain in germany - although the headquarters may move to düsseldorf .
when entering grohe 's sprawling factory in hemer , it soon becomes apparent that the plan ig metall is so keen to take credit for is well under way to be implemented .
making upmarket kitchen and bathroom taps involves a complex process ; yet one where highly skilled workers are rapidly becoming obsolete .
last year , there were about 1,000 workers at the factory .
now there are 880 .
next year there will be just 660 .
" ten years ago , there was one robot , a pilot one that did n't really work .
now we have 80 , " head of production control ulrich moneke .
" we have to have a strategy to reduce labour costs , " he adds , explaining how new working practices are also being introduced .
staff only get paid if the products are properly made , and workers are paid as teams of two or three who then split their pay-packets - thus enhancing performance through peer pressure .
and yet , " the atmosphere in our plant is better than half a year ago " , says mr spigiel .
mr weigand , who is in charge of the grohe case at ig metall , agrees .
' locusts ' but , there are deeper worries .
mr weigand is deeply unhappy about the way " a strong traditional family company was asset stripped , with all it needs to produce and sustain jobs taken away " .
despite the fact that -lsb- the hedge funds and private equity firms -rsb- do n't have a majority , they can run the show michael ganal bmw director could ' locusts ' trigger a recovery ?
" nearly half the capital was taken out of the company by its private equity investors , " he insists .
adds mr bartel : " this is a dangerous development for an economy . "
mr bartel makes a clear distinction between what he deems proper foreign direct investment -where money flows in and jobs are created - and situations where cash reserves are withdrawn , where debts accumulated against remaining assets and jobs axed .
" investment to secure jobs is welcome , but those who take money away are not , " he says .
new focus mr spigiel 's rebuttal is strong .
he believes private equity companies can improve matters by " re-engineering " companies over a period of several years , as they do not have to face the short-term demands of the stock market .
" they want to sell the company five years down the line .
they do n't take any dividends during that time , and we have time to change the company in a private atmosphere , " he says .
grohe aims to make production more hi-tech " now , with the strong position of grohe , is the time to do this -lsb- restructuring -rsb- .
we are able to finance the social plan . "
those laid off are employed for a year - at 80 % of their former salary - by a specially constructed subsidiary that retrains them and finds them new jobs .
this burden is jointly carried by grohe , which pays about a fifth of the cost , and the state which pays the balance .
it is obvious that workers ' rights are still strong in germany .
" the ig metall people are clever , " acknowledges mr spigiel , " but they have too much power " .
this is the fourth in a series of reports from germany ; in the run-up to the election we are also looking at the country 's economy , its unemployed , and how its companies are trying to beat the slump .

in may , chairman of the governing spd social democratic party franz muntefering was given a beating in a local election by workers angry at the way jobs were being moved to cheaper countries and worried about the erosion of workers ' rights .
seeing the writing on the wall , mr muntefering had tried to blame foreign private equity investors for germany 's economic ills , labelling them " locusts " who were asset stripping companies , sparking large job losses in the process .
a plan by grohe water technology to cut thousands of jobs and move production to china made matters worse for mr muntefering .
not only because the kitchen and bathroom fittings manufacturer 's home town hemer lies within his electoral district .
but also because grohe is owned by two private equity firms , tpg -lrb- texas pacific group -rrb- and csfb -lrb- credit suisse first boston -rrb- .
" the company planned to cut 3,200 jobs -lsb- from its workforce of about 4,500 -rsb- , based on a proposal by the consultants mckinsey , " says regional ig metall union representative joerg weigand .
this , says mr weigand , would have ended grohe 's industrial production in germany and dealt a devastating blow to the people of hemer , who have even named their town square grohe platz .
union victory the manufacturer 's plan sparked a savage response from german unions as it came to be seen as a symbol of what is wrong with the way the country 's troubled economy is managed . "
there was no plan b until ig metall came up with one " ralf bartel , dgb trade union federation yet , rather than launching industrial action , ig metall proposed a compromise - accepting almost 1,000 job cuts and one factory closure , in return for fresh investment at remaining german factories to secure future employment .
grohe - wary of negative publicity - swiftly took the union 's recommendations onboard and sorted out the dispute internally .
there was praise for ig metall 's efforts in the dispute and the union 's membership , which had been slipping steadily for years , was given a much needed fillip .
" it is always difficult to call it a victory when several hundred jobs are lost , but compared with the alternative it was a victory , " insists mr weigand .
but there was no such luck for chancellor schroeder who was left with the precarious media balancing act of mollifying the unions as well as calming the fears of international investors , wary about his party colleague 's anti-capitalist rhetoric .
control issues underlying it all was a philosophical debate about control - who should be in charge of german industry and decide how companies should be run .
ralf bartel , of the german trade union federation dgb , believes unions and workers are often better than managers and owners at making the right decisions .
from an anglo-saxon point of view , there may be little rhyme or reason behind such a view .
but consider this : ig metall 's response to grohe 's plan was to hire what it describes as " better consultants " to pick apart the mckinsey report and hammer out an alternative plan that would both improve efficiency and safeguard hundreds of jobs .
mckinsey had not taken into account the value of existing know-how among grohe 's workers , the cost of moving to china , potential damage to the trademark of moving out of the made in germany zone , and the possibility of increasing productivity at existing plants by 30 % .
" there was no plan b until ig metall came up with one . "
balancing act grohe 's director of labour affairs detlef spigiel is keen to downplay the importance of the mckinsey report and insists the firm never intended to go along with all its recommendations .
instead it aimed to achieve " the right balance between added value and sales , and that is the reason why we must shift some production to asia and the nafta area " .
only 20 % of grohe 's sales are in germany , so it wants to reduce the proportion of production in germany from 80 % to 60 % - still high when compared with the car industry for example , mr spigiel says .
product development , design and research , as well as the firm 's head office will remain in germany - although the headquarters may move to düsseldorf .
when entering grohe 's sprawling factory in hemer , it soon becomes apparent that the plan ig metall is so keen to take credit for is well under way to be implemented .
making upmarket kitchen and bathroom taps involves a complex process ; yet one where highly skilled workers are rapidly becoming obsolete .
last year , there were about 1,000 workers at the factory .
now there are 880 .
next year there will be just 660 .
" ten years ago , there was one robot , a pilot one that did n't really work .
now we have 80 , " head of production control ulrich moneke .
" we have to have a strategy to reduce labour costs , " he adds , explaining how new working practices are also being introduced .
staff only get paid if the products are properly made , and workers are paid as teams of two or three who then split their pay-packets - thus enhancing performance through peer pressure .
and yet , " the atmosphere in our plant is better than half a year ago " , says mr spigiel .
mr weigand , who is in charge of the grohe case at ig metall , agrees .
' locusts ' but , there are deeper worries .
mr weigand is deeply unhappy about the way " a strong traditional family company was asset stripped , with all it needs to produce and sustain jobs taken away " . "
despite the fact that -lsb- the hedge funds and private equity firms -rsb- do n't have a majority , they can run the show " michael ganal bmw director could ' locusts ' trigger a recovery ?
" nearly half the capital was taken out of the company by its private equity investors , " he insists .
adds mr bartel : " this is a dangerous development for an economy . "
mr bartel makes a clear distinction between what he deems proper foreign direct investment -where money flows in and jobs are created - and situations where cash reserves are withdrawn , where debts accumulated against remaining assets and jobs axed .
" investment to secure jobs is welcome , but those who take money away are not , " he says .
new focus mr spigiel 's rebuttal is strong .
he believes private equity companies can improve matters by " re-engineering " companies over a period of several years , as they do not have to face the short-term demands of the stock market .
" they want to sell the company five years down the line .
they do n't take any dividends during that time , and we have time to change the company in a private atmosphere , " he says .
" now , with the strong position of grohe , is the time to do this -lsb- restructuring -rsb- .
we are able to finance the social plan . "
those laid off are employed for a year - at 80 % of their former salary - by a specially constructed subsidiary that retrains them and finds them new jobs .
this burden is jointly carried by grohe , which pays about a fifth of the cost , and the state which pays the balance .
it is obvious that workers ' rights are still strong in germany .
" the ig metall people are clever , " acknowledges mr spigiel , " but they have too much power " .
this is the fourth in a series of reports from germany ; in the run-up to the election we are also looking at the country 's economy , its unemployed , and how its companies are trying to beat the slump .

the un is meeting in an effort to find consensus on moves to reform the body , as well as tackling poverty .
mr blair told the summit more work was needed to stop the spread of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
it was now widely recognised the un could intervene when nations failed their own people , he argued .
in an appeal for unity among the 191 un member states , the uk prime minister said : " the un must come of age .
it must become the visible and credible expression of the globalisation of politics .
" we work with each other or we suffer in isolation . "
having earlier had backing for his call for international action against those who incite terrorism , mr blair said the un had a key role .
the prime minister said : " the terrorist attacks of the 7 july have their origins in an ideology born thousands of miles from our shores .
have your say the un can only be as strong as governments allow it to be su , vermont , australia send us your comments " the proliferation of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons will never be halted outside of an international consensus to do so .
" the un can be the instrument of achieving the global will of the people .
it must give leadership on terrorism .
" there is not and never can be any justification , any excuse , any cause that accepts the random slaughter of the innocent .
wherever it happens , whoever is responsible we stand united in condemnation . "
mr blair also spoke about poverty and the need to fulfil the millennium development goals , to improve life for the world 's poorest people .
the struggle against global poverty will define our moral standing in the eyes of the future tony blair " stalking this summer like a spectre are the millennium development goals , " he said .
" the struggle against global poverty will define our moral standing in the eyes of the future . "
mr blair did not directly refer to the genocide in rwanda , often cited by critics of the un as one of its worst failures , or the situation in darfur or sudan .
but he said it was now recognised that states ' sovereignty could be overridden by the un when people were suffering .
" the united nations peacebuilding commission must become the means of renewing nations where war and the collapse of proper systems of government have left them ravaged and their people desolate .
" for the first time at this summit we are agreed that states do not have the right to do what they will within their own borders but that we in the name of humanity have a common duty to protect people where their own governments will not . "
' exploiting our weaknesses ' the summit has failed to agree a definition of terrorism .
but the un security council backed a resolution brought forward by the uk calling on all states to outlaw incitement to terrorism .
mr blair said terrorism would not be defeated until the un united in both condemning acts of terror and fighting the " poisonous propaganda " which fuelled it .
he warned : " they want us to believe that somehow it is our fault .
that their extremism is somehow our responsibility .
" they play on our divisions ... they exploit our hesitations .
this is our weakness and they know it - and we must unite against this ghastly game with our conscience . "

australians can see the movie three weeks before it opens in the us and four weeks ahead of its uk launch .
early reviews have been excellent , with the age newspaper in melbourne describing the film as " a lot of fun and true to the original spirit " .
" the film retains the hand-made care - right down to the visible fingerprints of the animators on the faces . "
it 's good to see you can still produce stuff the old school way mel dunstone , cinemagoer cult abc tv film reviewers margaret pomeranz and david strattan gave the film 4.5 and 4 stars -lrb- out of a possible 5 -rrb- on their show this week .
" it is absolutely charming , but what i think is gorgeous is the creation of these characters , " said ms pomeranz .
" wallace is such a mad inventor - and gromit is such a painstaking dog - he understands everything , he does n't say a word and yet you understand exactly where he 's at . "

creator nick park has won two oscars for his claymation creations even though school holidays in australia do not begin until next week , a lunchtime screening in melbourne on wednesday was packed with children , their teachers and parents .
the film did not disappoint either the young or older demographic and nick park 's creation was met with gales of laughter .
afterwards , max , five , from sydney , said he thought the film was " very funny " .
lisa , 13 , from melbourne , said she had grown up with wallace and gromit and the film " was magical and better than i could have imagined " .
nick park fan and cinema-goer mel dunstone , from adelaide , had been looking forward to the movie .
" it was good to finally see a full-length feature of wallace and gromit , " she said .

do you agree with its positive reviews , or have wallace and gromit had their day ?

i just saw the curse of the were rabbit in a big cinema with just five other people scattered around it .
one thing that struck me was how full the room was with laughter .
i found the movie delightfully clever and full of the old charm .
emma , bathurst , australia why is this great british export getting released in australia first , followed by the us and we get it last ?
what a kick in the teeth to the uk fans that made wallace and gromit famous in the first place .
mark , bristol , uk having watched several wallace and gromit animations i 'm beginning to find them a little tired and samey .
i ca n't think of anything worse than choosing to sit through another 90 minutes of the same old material .
mike liff , london i can only presume that the film is opening in australia as a consolation prize for losing the ashes !
david macleod , chapel hill , usa wallace and gromit have lost none of their charm with the transition to the big screen .
a wonderfully clever storyline with brilliant characters make this a must-see .
it would have been so easy to have copied ideas from the earlier episodes but thankfully this has not happened .
it is also nice to see that claymation has not given way to the digital age which would have spoilt these two characters .
congratulations to nick park .

australians can see the movie three weeks before it opens in the us and four weeks ahead of its uk launch .
early reviews have been excellent , with the age newspaper in melbourne describing the film as " a lot of fun and true to the original spirit " .
" the film retains the hand-made care - right down to the visible fingerprints of the animators on the faces . "
it 's good to see you can still produce stuff the old school way mel dunstone , cinemagoer cult abc tv film reviewers margaret pomeranz and david strattan gave the film 4.5 and 4 stars -lrb- out of a possible 5 -rrb- on their show this week .
" it is absolutely charming , but what i think is gorgeous is the creation of these characters , " said ms pomeranz .
" wallace is such a mad inventor - and gromit is such a painstaking dog - he understands everything , he does n't say a word and yet you understand exactly where he 's at . "
send us your views on the film in the curse of the were-rabbit , claymation inventor wallace and his trusty dog gromit battle to protect their community 's vegetables from a marauding bunny .
co-directed by steve box , the film features characters voiced by ralph fiennes , helena bonham carter and comedian peter kay .
creator nick park has won two oscars for his claymation creations even though school holidays in australia do not begin until next week , a lunchtime screening in melbourne on wednesday was packed with children , their teachers and parents .
the film did not disappoint either the young or older demographic and nick park 's creation was met with gales of laughter .
afterwards , max , five , from sydney , said he thought the film was " very funny " .
lisa , 13 , from melbourne , said she had grown up with wallace and gromit and the film " was magical and better than i could have imagined " .

do you agree with its positive reviews , or have wallace and gromit had their day ?
tell us your views using the form below .
i just saw the curse of the were rabbit in a big cinema with just five other people scattered around it .
one thing that struck me was how full the room was with laughter .
i found the movie delightfully clever and full of the old charm .
emma , bathurst , australia why is this great british export getting released in australia first , followed by the us and we get it last ?
what a kick in the teeth to the uk fans that made wallace and gromit famous in the first place .
mark , bristol , uk having watched several wallace and gromit animations i 'm beginning to find them a little tired and samey .
i ca n't think of anything worse than choosing to sit through another 90 minutes of the same old material .
mike liff , london i can only presume that the film is opening in australia as a consolation prize for losing the ashes !
david macleod , chapel hill , usa wallace and gromit have lost none of their charm with the transition to the big screen .
a wonderfully clever storyline with brilliant characters make this a must-see .
it would have been so easy to have copied ideas from the earlier episodes but thankfully this has not happened .
it is also nice to see that claymation has not given way to the digital age which would have spoilt these two characters .
congratulations to nick park .
