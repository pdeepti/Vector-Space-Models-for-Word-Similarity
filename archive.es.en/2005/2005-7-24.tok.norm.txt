renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .
for a year , the two worked and fine-tuned their living wills .
affected by her mother 's death , renate wanted to avoid being kept alive artificially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate wants no artificial breathing apparatus attached to her " i did n't want to be kept on a resuscitator .
nor did i want to be fed intravenously , " she said .
when her time had come , others should let her go peacefully , she said .
but in germany physician-assisted death is illegal .
german justice minister brigitte zypries ' plans to loosen the restrictions were scrapped in february .
the country 's highest court recognized the binding nature of a living will for doctors and caregivers .
but the wills can only be implemented if the the patient 's true desire can be determined without doubt , which can be an impossibility .
relatives and guardians may have a different opinion , as in the case of terry schiavo in florida .
renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .
" i chose as legal guardians people i have known a long time , " renate explained .
" i asked them if they would be ready to do so -lrb- let me die -rrb- , and they quickly said ' yes ' . "
yet no matter what the circumstances , many things depend on the doctors on duty .
after all , their job is to extend life , and the decision as to when to stop life-preserving measures can be difficult .
the doctors ' power is what scares johanna the most .
" i am afraid that i wo n't be strong enough .
that i wo n't have the resolve to stand up for her will , " she said with a sense of trepidation .

schumi lies in third place some 34 points off the top spot and has a lot to do if he is to record his 85th career win . ferrari 's poor season to date is unlikely to get better with hopes dwindling that the 36-year-old will add to his sole victory of the season although the seven-time world champion characteristically refuses to rule it out . schumi and ferrari still in the fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " contrary to many other people 's opinions , we have in no means written ourselves off , even though we have to admit that the situation has worsened recently , rather than improved , " said the german , referring to the problems with this season 's car .
" but that does n't mean that it ca n't be improved again , and that 's exactly what we 're working on . " the limelight is falling on two young pretenders to schumacher 's throne as sunday 's race approaches .

the finn retired from last year 's race because of a rear wing failure and this season has been plagued by technical problems which most recently cost him 10 places on the starting grid in each of the last two rounds . despite those penalties for engine failure , the 25-year-old managed to finish second and third but he will have to increase his total of three race wins if he is to make a significant impression on the 26-point chasm that separates him from alonso .
" the battle for the championship is still on and i am determined to get a good result and work on closing the gap , " said the finn .
" the -lrb- car -rrb- has good speed and we need to make the most of it this weekend . " montoya doing mclaren team mate no favors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juan pablo montoya raikkonen 's car is obviously a fast one this season but he 's not the only driver in a mclaren hot seat .
colombia 's juan pablo montoya is not to going to make way for his team mate while his own hopes of the title , however small , remain alive .
" i am really looking forward to racing again this weekend in germany , " said montoya , who won at hockenheim for williams two years ago and got his first victory for mclaren in britain two weeks ago . " i enjoy racing at hockenheim , i have performed well here and won in the past and i am aiming for a strong result like at silverstone .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .
for a year , the two worked and fine-tuned their living wills .
affected by her mother 's death , renate wanted to avoid being kept alive artificially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate wants no artificial breathing apparatus attached to her " i did n't want to be kept on a resuscitator .
nor did i want to be fed intravenously , " she said .
when her time had come , others should let her go peacefully , she said .
but in germany physician-assisted death is illegal .
german justice minister brigitte zypries ' plans to loosen the restrictions were scrapped in february .
the country 's highest court recognized the binding nature of a living will for doctors and caregivers .
but the wills can only be implemented if the the patient 's true desire can be determined without doubt , which can be an impossibility .
relatives and guardians may have a different opinion , as in the case of terry schiavo in florida .
renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .
" i chose as legal guardians people i have known a long time , " renate explained .
" i asked them if they would be ready to do so -lrb- let me die -rrb- , and they quickly said ' yes ' . "
yet no matter what the circumstances , many things depend on the doctors on duty .
after all , their job is to extend life , and the decision as to when to stop life-preserving measures can be difficult .
the doctors ' power is what scares johanna the most .
" i am afraid that i wo n't be strong enough .
that i wo n't have the resolve to stand up for her will , " she said with a sense of trepidation .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday . the bombs that ripped through shopping and hotel areas in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in egypt 's worst attack since 1981 have killed at least 88 people among them foreign tourists vacationing there . two britons , two italians , one ukrainian , one russian , one dutch citizen and one israeli of arab descent died in the blasts , egyptian sources told afp .
the czech republic later reported one of its nationals had died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel was reduced to rubble the egyptian resort which as well as being a top tourist resort is also regularly used for high-level summits and international conferences . shaken tourists spoke of mass panic and hysteria as people fled the carnage in the early hours of saturday , with bodies strewn across the roads , people screaming and sirens wailing . " barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .
" it would play into the hands of terrorists , " sergei sinitsyn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks among the debris in front of gazala gardens hotel the netherlands advised its nationals to stay close to beaches and stick to well marked roads in sinai but did not suggest planned trips should be abandoned . but sweden , denmark and italy told travelers to cancel any planned visits to the sinai peninsula . denmark , which said two of its nationals had been slightly hurt in the blasts that targeted tourist-packed hotels , warned " all unnecessary travel " to the region should be avoided .
" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .
" and terrorists want to achieve the greatest possible shock value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotional scenes at the frankfurt airport as german tourists return home german holidaymakers returning from sharm el-sheikh arrived back at frankfurt airport in emotional scenes late on saturday .
fifty-three passengers who had booked holidays with the giant german tour operator tui returned on a flight from egypt , some in tears . other flights carrying germans were arriving throughout the day . german chancellor gerhard schröder said the attacks " showed disdain for human life " and had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism the world according to merkel unemployment election 2005 -pipe- 24.07.2005 economy set to dominate german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 'll handle the economy better ?
that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

because there 's no point in shooting at somebody 's chest because that 's where the bomb is likely to be . " he added : " there 's no point in shooting anywhere else because if they fall down they detonate it .
it is drawn on the experience from other countries including sri lanka . " " the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " the metropolitan police commissioner said . blair expressed " deep regrets " over friday 's incident when police mistakenly shot a brazilian man during a chase onto a subway train in south london , a day after a new wave of attempted bombings . brazil 's foreign ministry demanded an explanation into the " lamentable error " which saw 27-year-old electrician jean charles de menezes pursued through a subway station before being cornered and shot repeatedly in the head . the country was " outraged and amazed " that the man was mistakenly shot by police , a statement issued by the brazilian foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes menezes ' family is said to be shocked by the circumstances surrounding his death . his cousin , alex alves pereira , from london , told the bbc : " apologies are not enough .
i believe my cousin 's death was result of police incompetence . "
describing his cousin as a " person full of life " he said his cousin was " a victim of government 's mistakes . " britain 's muslims wary british islamic groups called for a public inquiry into the shooting , worried that the asian ethnic origin of some of the bombers could see muslims targeted by police . dr azzam tamimi , from the muslim association of britain , told bbc news the police should review their procedures .
" it is human lives that are being targeted whether by terrorists or whether in this case unfortunately by people who are supposed to be chasing or catching the terrorists , " tamimi said .
" this is very frightening , people will be afraid to walk the streets now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london .
massoud shadjareh , head of the london-based islamic human rights commission , called for a full public inquiry . " how can you shoot someone on mere suspicion ?
you ca n't even put someone in prison on suspicion , how can you kill them like that ? " he said . " a cornered rabbit " but newspapers and london 's mayor called for understanding .
the carnage of the july 7 bombings , in which four suicide attackers and 52 others died , and the near-miss thursday when bombs used in a repeat attack seemingly failed to explode properly , meant police faced an impossible situation , they said . " the police acted to do what they believed necessary to protect the lives of the public .
this tragedy has added another victim to the toll of deaths for which the terrorists bear responsibility , " london mayor ken livingstone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police gather outside stockwell station , south london where they shot and killed a man .
terrified subway passengers scattered in panic on friday morning as plain-clothed police pursued menezes , who relatives said was going to work , through stockwell underground station in south london . witnesses said the brazilian - described as looking " like a cornered rabbit " - fell to the floor in a train carriage before a policeman standing directly above shot him five times in the head . police faced tough choice " for somebody to lose their life in such circumstances is a tragedy and one that the metropolitan police service regrets , " london 's police force said saturday in their first admission they had killed an innocent man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britsh police are under fire following the revelation that the man they shot and killed on friday was an innocent brazilian initially , police said menezes was linked to thursday 's attacks , noting that he was wearing a thick coat on a warm summer day , prompting fears he could be carrying explosives . sunday 's newspapers agreed that however tragic the outcome , it was difficult to blame police for taking the action they did . if a suicide bomber is merely wounded " he can massacre in his final seconds of consciousness " , the mail on sunday noted in its editorial .
" in the london of july 2005 , few would want the police to take any chances .
and bear in mind that if the stockwell suspect had been wearing a suicide belt , the officers who shot him would be lauded as heroes and loaded with medals , as well as the thanks of a grateful public . " probe gathers speed as the controversy raged , the police investigation into the bombings appeared to be advancing at speed , with much information gathered from the four failed rucksack-based bombs abandoned on thursday . according to the observer newspaper , documents found in one of the rucksacks have led police towards a potentially vital clue - a possible link between the two sets of attackers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this cctv image made available in london saturday , 16 july 2005 , by the metropolitan police , the four london bombers are seen arriving at luton railway station at 0721 local time on thursday , 07 july 2005 .

both were detained during raids friday in stockwell , near where the brazilian man was shot . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which were plastered over the front pages of saturday 's press .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .

the illness had shaken her to the bone .

renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .
for a year , the two worked and fine-tuned their living wills .
affected by her mother 's death , renate wanted to avoid being kept alive artificially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate wants no artificial breathing apparatus attached to her " i did n't want to be kept on a resuscitator .
nor did i want to be fed intravenously , " she said .
when her time had come , others should let her go peacefully , she said .
but in germany physician-assisted death is illegal .
german justice minister brigitte zypries ' plans to loosen the restrictions were scrapped in february .
the country 's highest court recognized the binding nature of a living will for doctors and caregivers .
but the wills can only be implemented if the the patient 's true desire can be determined without doubt , which can be an impossibility .
relatives and guardians may have a different opinion , as in the case of terry schiavo in florida .
renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .
" i chose as legal guardians people i have known a long time , " renate explained .
" i asked them if they would be ready to do so -lrb- let me die -rrb- , and they quickly said ' yes ' . "
yet no matter what the circumstances , many things depend on the doctors on duty .
after all , their job is to extend life , and the decision as to when to stop life-preserving measures can be difficult .
the doctors ' power is what scares johanna the most .
" i am afraid that i wo n't be strong enough .
that i wo n't have the resolve to stand up for her will , " she said with a sense of trepidation .
exactly the trepidation that those have who decide to go ahead and write their living will . karin lamsfuss -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe often baffled at schiavo furor the case of terri schiavo has been closely followed by europeans .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism the world according to merkel unemployment election 2005 -pipe- 24.07.2005 economy set to dominate german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 'll handle the economy better ?
that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

" germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .

but in germany physician-assisted death is illegal .
german justice minister brigitte zypries ' plans to loosen the restrictions were scrapped in february .
the country 's highest court recognized the binding nature of a living will for doctors and caregivers .
but the wills can only be implemented if the the patient 's true desire can be determined without doubt , which can be an impossibility .
relatives and guardians may have a different opinion , as in the case of terry schiavo in florida .
renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .
" i chose as legal guardians people i have known a long time , " renate explained .
" i asked them if they would be ready to do so -lrb- let me die -rrb- , and they quickly said ' yes ' . "
yet no matter what the circumstances , many things depend on the doctors on duty .
after all , their job is to extend life , and the decision as to when to stop life-preserving measures can be difficult .
the doctors ' power is what scares johanna the most .
" i am afraid that i wo n't be strong enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2005 plane crash reignites security debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all that remained of the plane was a gutted wreck the plane crash in front of the german parliament and the bombings in london and egypt have stirred a security debate in germany .
politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .
she said a possible example could be the protection of sensitive buildings by soldiers . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de small plane crashes near german parliament an ultralight small aircraft crashed between the german parliament and chancellor gerhard schröder 's office in berlin friday , killing the pilot .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.07.2005 armstrong wins tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong is the only person to have won the tour seven times lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career . the 33-year-old discovery channel team rider finished the race with a 4min 40sec lead on italian ivan basso with germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , finishing third on the podium at 6:21 behind armstrong . alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan , who rides for ullrich 's t-mobile team , won the 21st and final stage after pulling ahead of australian brad mcgee in the last 200 metres on the champs elysees .
it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .
it 's not a criticism .
if he was on our team that would be the first thing we would tell him . " and next july ? " i can promise you one thing .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.07.2005 armstrong wins tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong is the only person to have won the tour seven times lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career . the 33-year-old discovery channel team rider finished the race with a 4min 40sec lead on italian ivan basso with germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , finishing third on the podium at 6:21 behind armstrong . alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan , who rides for ullrich 's t-mobile team , won the 21st and final stage after pulling ahead of australian brad mcgee in the last 200 metres on the champs elysees .
it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday . the bombs that ripped through shopping and hotel areas in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in egypt 's worst attack since 1981 have killed at least 88 people among them foreign tourists vacationing there . two britons , two italians , one ukrainian , one russian , one dutch citizen and one israeli of arab descent died in the blasts , egyptian sources told afp .

" barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' .

" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism the world according to merkel unemployment election 2005 -pipe- 24.07.2005 economy set to dominate german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 'll handle the economy better ?
that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .
in eastern germany , where unemployment is around twice as high as in the west , the ratio was as high as 87 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 read about the latest developments in the early german elections , the candidates and the key issues involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.07.2005 armstrong wins tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong is the only person to have won the tour seven times lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career . the 33-year-old discovery channel team rider finished the race with a 4min 40sec lead on italian ivan basso with germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , finishing third on the podium at 6:21 behind armstrong . alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan , who rides for ullrich 's t-mobile team , won the 21st and final stage after pulling ahead of australian brad mcgee in the last 200 metres on the champs elysees .
it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .

" this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .

now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny .

the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .
it 's not a criticism .
if he was on our team that would be the first thing we would tell him . " and next july ? " i can promise you one thing .
i will be parked in front of the tv watching the tour de france .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .

german justice minister brigitte zypries ' plans to loosen the restrictions were scrapped in february .
the country 's highest court recognized the binding nature of a living will for doctors and caregivers .
but the wills can only be implemented if the the patient 's true desire can be determined without doubt , which can be an impossibility .
relatives and guardians may have a different opinion , as in the case of terry schiavo in florida .
renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .
" i chose as legal guardians people i have known a long time , " renate explained .
" i asked them if they would be ready to do so -lrb- let me die -rrb- , and they quickly said ' yes ' . "
yet no matter what the circumstances , many things depend on the doctors on duty .
after all , their job is to extend life , and the decision as to when to stop life-preserving measures can be difficult .
the doctors ' power is what scares johanna the most .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .
for a year , the two worked and fine-tuned their living wills .
affected by her mother 's death , renate wanted to avoid being kept alive artificially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate wants no artificial breathing apparatus attached to her " i did n't want to be kept on a resuscitator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.07.2005 armstrong wins tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong is the only person to have won the tour seven times lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career . the 33-year-old discovery channel team rider finished the race with a 4min 40sec lead on italian ivan basso with germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , finishing third on the podium at 6:21 behind armstrong . alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan , who rides for ullrich 's t-mobile team , won the 21st and final stage after pulling ahead of australian brad mcgee in the last 200 metres on the champs elysees .
it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .
it 's not a criticism .
if he was on our team that would be the first thing we would tell him . " and next july ? " i can promise you one thing .
i will be parked in front of the tv watching the tour de france .

that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening .

" germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility .

" ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

" ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday . the bombs that ripped through shopping and hotel areas in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in egypt 's worst attack since 1981 have killed at least 88 people among them foreign tourists vacationing there . two britons , two italians , one ukrainian , one russian , one dutch citizen and one israeli of arab descent died in the blasts , egyptian sources told afp .
the czech republic later reported one of its nationals had died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel was reduced to rubble the egyptian resort which as well as being a top tourist resort is also regularly used for high-level summits and international conferences . shaken tourists spoke of mass panic and hysteria as people fled the carnage in the early hours of saturday , with bodies strewn across the roads , people screaming and sirens wailing . " barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .
" it would play into the hands of terrorists , " sergei sinitsyn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks among the debris in front of gazala gardens hotel the netherlands advised its nationals to stay close to beaches and stick to well marked roads in sinai but did not suggest planned trips should be abandoned . but sweden , denmark and italy told travelers to cancel any planned visits to the sinai peninsula . denmark , which said two of its nationals had been slightly hurt in the blasts that targeted tourist-packed hotels , warned " all unnecessary travel " to the region should be avoided .
" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .
" and terrorists want to achieve the greatest possible shock value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotional scenes at the frankfurt airport as german tourists return home german holidaymakers returning from sharm el-sheikh arrived back at frankfurt airport in emotional scenes late on saturday .
fifty-three passengers who had booked holidays with the giant german tour operator tui returned on a flight from egypt , some in tears . other flights carrying germans were arriving throughout the day . german chancellor gerhard schröder said the attacks " showed disdain for human life " and had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2005 plane crash reignites security debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all that remained of the plane was a gutted wreck the plane crash in front of the german parliament and the bombings in london and egypt have stirred a security debate in germany .
politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district .

the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .
it 's not a criticism .
if he was on our team that would be the first thing we would tell him . " and next july ? " i can promise you one thing .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .
it 's not a criticism .
if he was on our team that would be the first thing we would tell him . " and next july ? " i can promise you one thing .

that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.07.2005 plane crash reignites security debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all that remained of the plane was a gutted wreck the plane crash in front of the german parliament and the bombings in london and egypt have stirred a security debate in germany .
politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .
she said a possible example could be the protection of sensitive buildings by soldiers . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de small plane crashes near german parliament an ultralight small aircraft crashed between the german parliament and chancellor gerhard schröder 's office in berlin friday , killing the pilot .

" barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat .

it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday . the bombs that ripped through shopping and hotel areas in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in egypt 's worst attack since 1981 have killed at least 88 people among them foreign tourists vacationing there . two britons , two italians , one ukrainian , one russian , one dutch citizen and one israeli of arab descent died in the blasts , egyptian sources told afp .
the czech republic later reported one of its nationals had died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel was reduced to rubble the egyptian resort which as well as being a top tourist resort is also regularly used for high-level summits and international conferences . shaken tourists spoke of mass panic and hysteria as people fled the carnage in the early hours of saturday , with bodies strewn across the roads , people screaming and sirens wailing . " barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .
" it would play into the hands of terrorists , " sergei sinitsyn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks among the debris in front of gazala gardens hotel the netherlands advised its nationals to stay close to beaches and stick to well marked roads in sinai but did not suggest planned trips should be abandoned . but sweden , denmark and italy told travelers to cancel any planned visits to the sinai peninsula . denmark , which said two of its nationals had been slightly hurt in the blasts that targeted tourist-packed hotels , warned " all unnecessary travel " to the region should be avoided .
" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .
" and terrorists want to achieve the greatest possible shock value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotional scenes at the frankfurt airport as german tourists return home german holidaymakers returning from sharm el-sheikh arrived back at frankfurt airport in emotional scenes late on saturday .
fifty-three passengers who had booked holidays with the giant german tour operator tui returned on a flight from egypt , some in tears . other flights carrying germans were arriving throughout the day . german chancellor gerhard schröder said the attacks " showed disdain for human life " and had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .
for a year , the two worked and fine-tuned their living wills .
affected by her mother 's death , renate wanted to avoid being kept alive artificially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate wants no artificial breathing apparatus attached to her " i did n't want to be kept on a resuscitator .
nor did i want to be fed intravenously , " she said .
when her time had come , others should let her go peacefully , she said .
but in germany physician-assisted death is illegal .
german justice minister brigitte zypries ' plans to loosen the restrictions were scrapped in february .
the country 's highest court recognized the binding nature of a living will for doctors and caregivers .
but the wills can only be implemented if the the patient 's true desire can be determined without doubt , which can be an impossibility .
relatives and guardians may have a different opinion , as in the case of terry schiavo in florida .
renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .
" i chose as legal guardians people i have known a long time , " renate explained .
" i asked them if they would be ready to do so -lrb- let me die -rrb- , and they quickly said ' yes ' . "
yet no matter what the circumstances , many things depend on the doctors on duty .
after all , their job is to extend life , and the decision as to when to stop life-preserving measures can be difficult .
the doctors ' power is what scares johanna the most .
" i am afraid that i wo n't be strong enough .
that i wo n't have the resolve to stand up for her will , " she said with a sense of trepidation .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .
for a year , the two worked and fine-tuned their living wills .
affected by her mother 's death , renate wanted to avoid being kept alive artificially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate wants no artificial breathing apparatus attached to her " i did n't want to be kept on a resuscitator .
nor did i want to be fed intravenously , " she said .
when her time had come , others should let her go peacefully , she said .
but in germany physician-assisted death is illegal .
german justice minister brigitte zypries ' plans to loosen the restrictions were scrapped in february .
the country 's highest court recognized the binding nature of a living will for doctors and caregivers .
but the wills can only be implemented if the the patient 's true desire can be determined without doubt , which can be an impossibility .
relatives and guardians may have a different opinion , as in the case of terry schiavo in florida .
renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .
" i chose as legal guardians people i have known a long time , " renate explained .
" i asked them if they would be ready to do so -lrb- let me die -rrb- , and they quickly said ' yes ' . "
yet no matter what the circumstances , many things depend on the doctors on duty .
after all , their job is to extend life , and the decision as to when to stop life-preserving measures can be difficult .
the doctors ' power is what scares johanna the most .
" i am afraid that i wo n't be strong enough .

because there 's no point in shooting at somebody 's chest because that 's where the bomb is likely to be . " he added : " there 's no point in shooting anywhere else because if they fall down they detonate it .
it is drawn on the experience from other countries including sri lanka . " " the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " the metropolitan police commissioner said . blair expressed " deep regrets " over friday 's incident when police mistakenly shot a brazilian man during a chase onto a subway train in south london , a day after a new wave of attempted bombings . brazil 's foreign ministry demanded an explanation into the " lamentable error " which saw 27-year-old electrician jean charles de menezes pursued through a subway station before being cornered and shot repeatedly in the head . the country was " outraged and amazed " that the man was mistakenly shot by police , a statement issued by the brazilian foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes menezes ' family is said to be shocked by the circumstances surrounding his death . his cousin , alex alves pereira , from london , told the bbc : " apologies are not enough .
i believe my cousin 's death was result of police incompetence . "
describing his cousin as a " person full of life " he said his cousin was " a victim of government 's mistakes . " britain 's muslims wary british islamic groups called for a public inquiry into the shooting , worried that the asian ethnic origin of some of the bombers could see muslims targeted by police . dr azzam tamimi , from the muslim association of britain , told bbc news the police should review their procedures .
" it is human lives that are being targeted whether by terrorists or whether in this case unfortunately by people who are supposed to be chasing or catching the terrorists , " tamimi said .
" this is very frightening , people will be afraid to walk the streets now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london .
massoud shadjareh , head of the london-based islamic human rights commission , called for a full public inquiry . " how can you shoot someone on mere suspicion ?
you ca n't even put someone in prison on suspicion , how can you kill them like that ? " he said . " a cornered rabbit " but newspapers and london 's mayor called for understanding .
the carnage of the july 7 bombings , in which four suicide attackers and 52 others died , and the near-miss thursday when bombs used in a repeat attack seemingly failed to explode properly , meant police faced an impossible situation , they said . " the police acted to do what they believed necessary to protect the lives of the public .
this tragedy has added another victim to the toll of deaths for which the terrorists bear responsibility , " london mayor ken livingstone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police gather outside stockwell station , south london where they shot and killed a man .
terrified subway passengers scattered in panic on friday morning as plain-clothed police pursued menezes , who relatives said was going to work , through stockwell underground station in south london . witnesses said the brazilian - described as looking " like a cornered rabbit " - fell to the floor in a train carriage before a policeman standing directly above shot him five times in the head . police faced tough choice " for somebody to lose their life in such circumstances is a tragedy and one that the metropolitan police service regrets , " london 's police force said saturday in their first admission they had killed an innocent man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britsh police are under fire following the revelation that the man they shot and killed on friday was an innocent brazilian initially , police said menezes was linked to thursday 's attacks , noting that he was wearing a thick coat on a warm summer day , prompting fears he could be carrying explosives . sunday 's newspapers agreed that however tragic the outcome , it was difficult to blame police for taking the action they did . if a suicide bomber is merely wounded " he can massacre in his final seconds of consciousness " , the mail on sunday noted in its editorial .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .
she said a possible example could be the protection of sensitive buildings by soldiers . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de small plane crashes near german parliament an ultralight small aircraft crashed between the german parliament and chancellor gerhard schröder 's office in berlin friday , killing the pilot .

" " the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " the metropolitan police commissioner said . blair expressed " deep regrets " over friday 's incident when police mistakenly shot a brazilian man during a chase onto a subway train in south london , a day after a new wave of attempted bombings . brazil 's foreign ministry demanded an explanation into the " lamentable error " which saw 27-year-old electrician jean charles de menezes pursued through a subway station before being cornered and shot repeatedly in the head . the country was " outraged and amazed " that the man was mistakenly shot by police , a statement issued by the brazilian foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes menezes ' family is said to be shocked by the circumstances surrounding his death . his cousin , alex alves pereira , from london , told the bbc : " apologies are not enough .
i believe my cousin 's death was result of police incompetence . "
describing his cousin as a " person full of life " he said his cousin was " a victim of government 's mistakes . " britain 's muslims wary british islamic groups called for a public inquiry into the shooting , worried that the asian ethnic origin of some of the bombers could see muslims targeted by police . dr azzam tamimi , from the muslim association of britain , told bbc news the police should review their procedures .
" it is human lives that are being targeted whether by terrorists or whether in this case unfortunately by people who are supposed to be chasing or catching the terrorists , " tamimi said .
" this is very frightening , people will be afraid to walk the streets now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london .
massoud shadjareh , head of the london-based islamic human rights commission , called for a full public inquiry . " how can you shoot someone on mere suspicion ?
you ca n't even put someone in prison on suspicion , how can you kill them like that ? " he said . " a cornered rabbit " but newspapers and london 's mayor called for understanding .
the carnage of the july 7 bombings , in which four suicide attackers and 52 others died , and the near-miss thursday when bombs used in a repeat attack seemingly failed to explode properly , meant police faced an impossible situation , they said . " the police acted to do what they believed necessary to protect the lives of the public .
this tragedy has added another victim to the toll of deaths for which the terrorists bear responsibility , " london mayor ken livingstone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police gather outside stockwell station , south london where they shot and killed a man .
terrified subway passengers scattered in panic on friday morning as plain-clothed police pursued menezes , who relatives said was going to work , through stockwell underground station in south london . witnesses said the brazilian - described as looking " like a cornered rabbit " - fell to the floor in a train carriage before a policeman standing directly above shot him five times in the head . police faced tough choice " for somebody to lose their life in such circumstances is a tragedy and one that the metropolitan police service regrets , " london 's police force said saturday in their first admission they had killed an innocent man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britsh police are under fire following the revelation that the man they shot and killed on friday was an innocent brazilian initially , police said menezes was linked to thursday 's attacks , noting that he was wearing a thick coat on a warm summer day , prompting fears he could be carrying explosives . sunday 's newspapers agreed that however tragic the outcome , it was difficult to blame police for taking the action they did . if a suicide bomber is merely wounded " he can massacre in his final seconds of consciousness " , the mail on sunday noted in its editorial .
" in the london of july 2005 , few would want the police to take any chances .
and bear in mind that if the stockwell suspect had been wearing a suicide belt , the officers who shot him would be lauded as heroes and loaded with medals , as well as the thanks of a grateful public . " probe gathers speed as the controversy raged , the police investigation into the bombings appeared to be advancing at speed , with much information gathered from the four failed rucksack-based bombs abandoned on thursday . according to the observer newspaper , documents found in one of the rucksacks have led police towards a potentially vital clue - a possible link between the two sets of attackers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this cctv image made available in london saturday , 16 july 2005 , by the metropolitan police , the four london bombers are seen arriving at luton railway station at 0721 local time on thursday , 07 july 2005 .

" barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' .

" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .

that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .
she said a possible example could be the protection of sensitive buildings by soldiers . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de small plane crashes near german parliament an ultralight small aircraft crashed between the german parliament and chancellor gerhard schröder 's office in berlin friday , killing the pilot .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.07.2005 armstrong wins tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong is the only person to have won the tour seven times lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career . the 33-year-old discovery channel team rider finished the race with a 4min 40sec lead on italian ivan basso with germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , finishing third on the podium at 6:21 behind armstrong . alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan , who rides for ullrich 's t-mobile team , won the 21st and final stage after pulling ahead of australian brad mcgee in the last 200 metres on the champs elysees .
it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams .

" i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .
it 's not a criticism .
if he was on our team that would be the first thing we would tell him . " and next july ? " i can promise you one thing .
i will be parked in front of the tv watching the tour de france .
i 'm a cycling fan and in 2006 it will be interesting tactically , " added armstrong . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the winding ways of an unequal rivalry if everything goes as expected , lance armstrong will celebrate his seventh consecutive tour de france victory on sunday .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism the world according to merkel unemployment election 2005 -pipe- 24.07.2005 economy set to dominate german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 'll handle the economy better ?
that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday . the bombs that ripped through shopping and hotel areas in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in egypt 's worst attack since 1981 have killed at least 88 people among them foreign tourists vacationing there . two britons , two italians , one ukrainian , one russian , one dutch citizen and one israeli of arab descent died in the blasts , egyptian sources told afp .
the czech republic later reported one of its nationals had died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel was reduced to rubble the egyptian resort which as well as being a top tourist resort is also regularly used for high-level summits and international conferences . shaken tourists spoke of mass panic and hysteria as people fled the carnage in the early hours of saturday , with bodies strewn across the roads , people screaming and sirens wailing . " barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .
" it would play into the hands of terrorists , " sergei sinitsyn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks among the debris in front of gazala gardens hotel the netherlands advised its nationals to stay close to beaches and stick to well marked roads in sinai but did not suggest planned trips should be abandoned . but sweden , denmark and italy told travelers to cancel any planned visits to the sinai peninsula . denmark , which said two of its nationals had been slightly hurt in the blasts that targeted tourist-packed hotels , warned " all unnecessary travel " to the region should be avoided .
" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .
" and terrorists want to achieve the greatest possible shock value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotional scenes at the frankfurt airport as german tourists return home german holidaymakers returning from sharm el-sheikh arrived back at frankfurt airport in emotional scenes late on saturday .
fifty-three passengers who had booked holidays with the giant german tour operator tui returned on a flight from egypt , some in tears . other flights carrying germans were arriving throughout the day . german chancellor gerhard schröder said the attacks " showed disdain for human life " and had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike . " " the horrible attacks of recent weeks demand even more intensive international cooperation , in order to dismantle terrorist networks that are even more cruel , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de egypt hit by deadly bomb blasts suicide car bombers unleashed a trail of carnage in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh saturday , killing at least 83 people , including tourists from britain , italy and holland and injuring german nationals .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .

that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

" barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .
" it would play into the hands of terrorists , " sergei sinitsyn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks among the debris in front of gazala gardens hotel the netherlands advised its nationals to stay close to beaches and stick to well marked roads in sinai but did not suggest planned trips should be abandoned . but sweden , denmark and italy told travelers to cancel any planned visits to the sinai peninsula . denmark , which said two of its nationals had been slightly hurt in the blasts that targeted tourist-packed hotels , warned " all unnecessary travel " to the region should be avoided .
" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .

" barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism the world according to merkel unemployment election 2005 -pipe- 24.07.2005 economy set to dominate german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 'll handle the economy better ?
that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .

because there 's no point in shooting at somebody 's chest because that 's where the bomb is likely to be . " he added : " there 's no point in shooting anywhere else because if they fall down they detonate it .
it is drawn on the experience from other countries including sri lanka . " " the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " the metropolitan police commissioner said . blair expressed " deep regrets " over friday 's incident when police mistakenly shot a brazilian man during a chase onto a subway train in south london , a day after a new wave of attempted bombings . brazil 's foreign ministry demanded an explanation into the " lamentable error " which saw 27-year-old electrician jean charles de menezes pursued through a subway station before being cornered and shot repeatedly in the head . the country was " outraged and amazed " that the man was mistakenly shot by police , a statement issued by the brazilian foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes menezes ' family is said to be shocked by the circumstances surrounding his death . his cousin , alex alves pereira , from london , told the bbc : " apologies are not enough .
i believe my cousin 's death was result of police incompetence . "
describing his cousin as a " person full of life " he said his cousin was " a victim of government 's mistakes . " britain 's muslims wary british islamic groups called for a public inquiry into the shooting , worried that the asian ethnic origin of some of the bombers could see muslims targeted by police . dr azzam tamimi , from the muslim association of britain , told bbc news the police should review their procedures .
" it is human lives that are being targeted whether by terrorists or whether in this case unfortunately by people who are supposed to be chasing or catching the terrorists , " tamimi said .
" this is very frightening , people will be afraid to walk the streets now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london .
massoud shadjareh , head of the london-based islamic human rights commission , called for a full public inquiry . " how can you shoot someone on mere suspicion ?
you ca n't even put someone in prison on suspicion , how can you kill them like that ? " he said . " a cornered rabbit " but newspapers and london 's mayor called for understanding .
the carnage of the july 7 bombings , in which four suicide attackers and 52 others died , and the near-miss thursday when bombs used in a repeat attack seemingly failed to explode properly , meant police faced an impossible situation , they said . " the police acted to do what they believed necessary to protect the lives of the public .
this tragedy has added another victim to the toll of deaths for which the terrorists bear responsibility , " london mayor ken livingstone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police gather outside stockwell station , south london where they shot and killed a man .
terrified subway passengers scattered in panic on friday morning as plain-clothed police pursued menezes , who relatives said was going to work , through stockwell underground station in south london . witnesses said the brazilian - described as looking " like a cornered rabbit " - fell to the floor in a train carriage before a policeman standing directly above shot him five times in the head . police faced tough choice " for somebody to lose their life in such circumstances is a tragedy and one that the metropolitan police service regrets , " london 's police force said saturday in their first admission they had killed an innocent man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britsh police are under fire following the revelation that the man they shot and killed on friday was an innocent brazilian initially , police said menezes was linked to thursday 's attacks , noting that he was wearing a thick coat on a warm summer day , prompting fears he could be carrying explosives . sunday 's newspapers agreed that however tragic the outcome , it was difficult to blame police for taking the action they did . if a suicide bomber is merely wounded " he can massacre in his final seconds of consciousness " , the mail on sunday noted in its editorial .
" in the london of july 2005 , few would want the police to take any chances .
and bear in mind that if the stockwell suspect had been wearing a suicide belt , the officers who shot him would be lauded as heroes and loaded with medals , as well as the thanks of a grateful public . " probe gathers speed as the controversy raged , the police investigation into the bombings appeared to be advancing at speed , with much information gathered from the four failed rucksack-based bombs abandoned on thursday . according to the observer newspaper , documents found in one of the rucksacks have led police towards a potentially vital clue - a possible link between the two sets of attackers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this cctv image made available in london saturday , 16 july 2005 , by the metropolitan police , the four london bombers are seen arriving at luton railway station at 0721 local time on thursday , 07 july 2005 .

the trip could even have been a " bonding " exercise for all concened , meaning the attacks were planned jointly , the paper said . two men have now been arrested in what has become one of britain 's biggest-ever manhunts .
both were detained during raids friday in stockwell , near where the brazilian man was shot . police said saturday that almost 500 people had called them after they released security camera images of the four suspected bombers , which were plastered over the front pages of saturday 's press . " detectives are now working through the information from the phone calls and e-mails and are hopeful that there will be significant lines of enquiry to follow , " a police statement said . additionally , officers raided an apartment in the streatham area of south london , not far from stockwell . london remains on edge but nerves remained on edge in the british capital . a park in northwest london was cordoned off saturday as police said they were investigating a suspect package found there , which according to one report had nails and bolts packed around it and wires protruding . an examination " suggests that the object may be linked to devices found " on thursday , police said in a statement . adding to the concerns , two britons were feared dead after suicide car bombers struck egypt 's red sea tourist resort of sharm el-sheikh , killing at least 88 people . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london in grip of tense manhunt for bombers british police have arrested a second man as a massive manhunt for four would-be suicide bombers gained pace saturday and new security scares kept londoners on nervous alert .

" the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .
in eastern germany , where unemployment is around twice as high as in the west , the ratio was as high as 87 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 read about the latest developments in the early german elections , the candidates and the key issues involved .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .
for a year , the two worked and fine-tuned their living wills .
affected by her mother 's death , renate wanted to avoid being kept alive artificially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate wants no artificial breathing apparatus attached to her " i did n't want to be kept on a resuscitator .
nor did i want to be fed intravenously , " she said .
when her time had come , others should let her go peacefully , she said .
but in germany physician-assisted death is illegal .
german justice minister brigitte zypries ' plans to loosen the restrictions were scrapped in february .
the country 's highest court recognized the binding nature of a living will for doctors and caregivers .
but the wills can only be implemented if the the patient 's true desire can be determined without doubt , which can be an impossibility .
relatives and guardians may have a different opinion , as in the case of terry schiavo in florida .
renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .
" i chose as legal guardians people i have known a long time , " renate explained .
" i asked them if they would be ready to do so -lrb- let me die -rrb- , and they quickly said ' yes ' . "
yet no matter what the circumstances , many things depend on the doctors on duty .
after all , their job is to extend life , and the decision as to when to stop life-preserving measures can be difficult .
the doctors ' power is what scares johanna the most .
" i am afraid that i wo n't be strong enough .
that i wo n't have the resolve to stand up for her will , " she said with a sense of trepidation .

renate and johanna are among those who have tackled the difficult subject . when american terry schiavo died in march after years in a permanent vegetative state and a fierce legal controversy , the question of living wills entered many people minds .
but the process of producing one is not easy .
the living will provides guidelines for relatives , legal guardians or even friends to stop providing medical assistance for a loved one who has been in an accident or is suffering a terminal illness and can no longer express their wishes .
the possible ease provided by the document for those who may ever face that decision can not be underestimated .
yet when two german friends in their 60s , renate and johanna , decided to tackle the issue , they found it was not a matter that they could complete overnight .
for renate , her mother 's long battle with throat cancer forced her to deal with the subject .
the illness had shaken her to the bone .
strapped to machines in the final years of her life , renate 's mother had lost her voice after six operations .
she had become emaciated and renate wondered if her mother could have died a more dignified death .
johanna was there when her friend wanted to discuss the uncomfortable subject .
" we always talked about it , said to each other ' i have to make a living will , i want to take care of it ' , " she said .
making deeds out of words facing one 's own death and the possible consequences of not being able to decide about continuing one 's life does not lend itself to quick action .
for a year , the two worked and fine-tuned their living wills .
affected by her mother 's death , renate wanted to avoid being kept alive artificially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate wants no artificial breathing apparatus attached to her " i did n't want to be kept on a resuscitator .
nor did i want to be fed intravenously , " she said .
when her time had come , others should let her go peacefully , she said .
but in germany physician-assisted death is illegal .
german justice minister brigitte zypries ' plans to loosen the restrictions were scrapped in february .
the country 's highest court recognized the binding nature of a living will for doctors and caregivers .
but the wills can only be implemented if the the patient 's true desire can be determined without doubt , which can be an impossibility .
relatives and guardians may have a different opinion , as in the case of terry schiavo in florida .
renate asked her daughter and her long-time friend johanna to be responsible for carrying out her living will , her legal guardians .
" i chose as legal guardians people i have known a long time , " renate explained .
" i asked them if they would be ready to do so -lrb- let me die -rrb- , and they quickly said ' yes ' . "
yet no matter what the circumstances , many things depend on the doctors on duty .
after all , their job is to extend life , and the decision as to when to stop life-preserving measures can be difficult .
the doctors ' power is what scares johanna the most .
" i am afraid that i wo n't be strong enough .
that i wo n't have the resolve to stand up for her will , " she said with a sense of trepidation .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism the world according to merkel unemployment election 2005 -pipe- 24.07.2005 economy set to dominate german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 'll handle the economy better ?
that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .
sentiment among german business leaders and investors has been rising recently , as measured by the key ifo and zew confidence barometers . but voters themselves are not so sure . in a poll carried out by the weekly bild woche , 75 percent of respondents , regardless of their political persuasion , said they did not expect the economic situation to improve after the elections .
in eastern germany , where unemployment is around twice as high as in the west , the ratio was as high as 87 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 read about the latest developments in the early german elections , the candidates and the key issues involved .
early elections prompt reserved optimism with the green light given by german president horst köhler , most politicians and people expect to vote on september 18 .
there is relief that changes might happen but do gemrans think they will ?
-lrb- july 22 , 2005 -rrb- german elections : what happens now ?

" barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat .

" where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .

because there 's no point in shooting at somebody 's chest because that 's where the bomb is likely to be . " he added : " there 's no point in shooting anywhere else because if they fall down they detonate it .
it is drawn on the experience from other countries including sri lanka . " " the only way to deal with this is to shoot to the head , " the metropolitan police commissioner said . blair expressed " deep regrets " over friday 's incident when police mistakenly shot a brazilian man during a chase onto a subway train in south london , a day after a new wave of attempted bombings . brazil 's foreign ministry demanded an explanation into the " lamentable error " which saw 27-year-old electrician jean charles de menezes pursued through a subway station before being cornered and shot repeatedly in the head . the country was " outraged and amazed " that the man was mistakenly shot by police , a statement issued by the brazilian foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian jean charles de menezes menezes ' family is said to be shocked by the circumstances surrounding his death . his cousin , alex alves pereira , from london , told the bbc : " apologies are not enough .
i believe my cousin 's death was result of police incompetence . "
describing his cousin as a " person full of life " he said his cousin was " a victim of government 's mistakes . " britain 's muslims wary british islamic groups called for a public inquiry into the shooting , worried that the asian ethnic origin of some of the bombers could see muslims targeted by police . dr azzam tamimi , from the muslim association of britain , told bbc news the police should review their procedures .
" it is human lives that are being targeted whether by terrorists or whether in this case unfortunately by people who are supposed to be chasing or catching the terrorists , " tamimi said .
" this is very frightening , people will be afraid to walk the streets now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london .
massoud shadjareh , head of the london-based islamic human rights commission , called for a full public inquiry . " how can you shoot someone on mere suspicion ?
you ca n't even put someone in prison on suspicion , how can you kill them like that ? " he said . " a cornered rabbit " but newspapers and london 's mayor called for understanding .
the carnage of the july 7 bombings , in which four suicide attackers and 52 others died , and the near-miss thursday when bombs used in a repeat attack seemingly failed to explode properly , meant police faced an impossible situation , they said . " the police acted to do what they believed necessary to protect the lives of the public .
this tragedy has added another victim to the toll of deaths for which the terrorists bear responsibility , " london mayor ken livingstone said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police gather outside stockwell station , south london where they shot and killed a man .
terrified subway passengers scattered in panic on friday morning as plain-clothed police pursued menezes , who relatives said was going to work , through stockwell underground station in south london . witnesses said the brazilian - described as looking " like a cornered rabbit " - fell to the floor in a train carriage before a policeman standing directly above shot him five times in the head . police faced tough choice " for somebody to lose their life in such circumstances is a tragedy and one that the metropolitan police service regrets , " london 's police force said saturday in their first admission they had killed an innocent man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britsh police are under fire following the revelation that the man they shot and killed on friday was an innocent brazilian initially , police said menezes was linked to thursday 's attacks , noting that he was wearing a thick coat on a warm summer day , prompting fears he could be carrying explosives . sunday 's newspapers agreed that however tragic the outcome , it was difficult to blame police for taking the action they did . if a suicide bomber is merely wounded " he can massacre in his final seconds of consciousness " , the mail on sunday noted in its editorial .
" in the london of july 2005 , few would want the police to take any chances .
and bear in mind that if the stockwell suspect had been wearing a suicide belt , the officers who shot him would be lauded as heroes and loaded with medals , as well as the thanks of a grateful public . " probe gathers speed as the controversy raged , the police investigation into the bombings appeared to be advancing at speed , with much information gathered from the four failed rucksack-based bombs abandoned on thursday . according to the observer newspaper , documents found in one of the rucksacks have led police towards a potentially vital clue - a possible link between the two sets of attackers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this cctv image made available in london saturday , 16 july 2005 , by the metropolitan police , the four london bombers are seen arriving at luton railway station at 0721 local time on thursday , 07 july 2005 .

epa / london metropolitan police / ho + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - report + + + according to the paper , some of the suspected bombers from thursday are believed to have been on a whitewater rafting trip in wales attended by two of the july 7 bombers , mohammad sidique khan and shahzad tanweer .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .

and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams .

now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .

let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday . the bombs that ripped through shopping and hotel areas in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in egypt 's worst attack since 1981 have killed at least 88 people among them foreign tourists vacationing there . two britons , two italians , one ukrainian , one russian , one dutch citizen and one israeli of arab descent died in the blasts , egyptian sources told afp .
the czech republic later reported one of its nationals had died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel was reduced to rubble the egyptian resort which as well as being a top tourist resort is also regularly used for high-level summits and international conferences . shaken tourists spoke of mass panic and hysteria as people fled the carnage in the early hours of saturday , with bodies strewn across the roads , people screaming and sirens wailing . " barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .
" it would play into the hands of terrorists , " sergei sinitsyn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks among the debris in front of gazala gardens hotel the netherlands advised its nationals to stay close to beaches and stick to well marked roads in sinai but did not suggest planned trips should be abandoned . but sweden , denmark and italy told travelers to cancel any planned visits to the sinai peninsula . denmark , which said two of its nationals had been slightly hurt in the blasts that targeted tourist-packed hotels , warned " all unnecessary travel " to the region should be avoided .
" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .
" and terrorists want to achieve the greatest possible shock value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotional scenes at the frankfurt airport as german tourists return home german holidaymakers returning from sharm el-sheikh arrived back at frankfurt airport in emotional scenes late on saturday .
fifty-three passengers who had booked holidays with the giant german tour operator tui returned on a flight from egypt , some in tears . other flights carrying germans were arriving throughout the day . german chancellor gerhard schröder said the attacks " showed disdain for human life " and had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday . the bombs that ripped through shopping and hotel areas in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in egypt 's worst attack since 1981 have killed at least 88 people among them foreign tourists vacationing there . two britons , two italians , one ukrainian , one russian , one dutch citizen and one israeli of arab descent died in the blasts , egyptian sources told afp .
the czech republic later reported one of its nationals had died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel was reduced to rubble the egyptian resort which as well as being a top tourist resort is also regularly used for high-level summits and international conferences . shaken tourists spoke of mass panic and hysteria as people fled the carnage in the early hours of saturday , with bodies strewn across the roads , people screaming and sirens wailing . " barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .

" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .
it 's not a criticism .
if he was on our team that would be the first thing we would tell him . " and next july ? " i can promise you one thing .
i will be parked in front of the tv watching the tour de france .
i 'm a cycling fan and in 2006 it will be interesting tactically , " added armstrong . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the winding ways of an unequal rivalry if everything goes as expected , lance armstrong will celebrate his seventh consecutive tour de france victory on sunday .

yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .
it 's not a criticism .
if he was on our team that would be the first thing we would tell him . " and next july ? " i can promise you one thing .
i will be parked in front of the tv watching the tour de france .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday . the bombs that ripped through shopping and hotel areas in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in egypt 's worst attack since 1981 have killed at least 88 people among them foreign tourists vacationing there . two britons , two italians , one ukrainian , one russian , one dutch citizen and one israeli of arab descent died in the blasts , egyptian sources told afp .
the czech republic later reported one of its nationals had died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel was reduced to rubble the egyptian resort which as well as being a top tourist resort is also regularly used for high-level summits and international conferences . shaken tourists spoke of mass panic and hysteria as people fled the carnage in the early hours of saturday , with bodies strewn across the roads , people screaming and sirens wailing . " barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .
" it would play into the hands of terrorists , " sergei sinitsyn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks among the debris in front of gazala gardens hotel the netherlands advised its nationals to stay close to beaches and stick to well marked roads in sinai but did not suggest planned trips should be abandoned . but sweden , denmark and italy told travelers to cancel any planned visits to the sinai peninsula . denmark , which said two of its nationals had been slightly hurt in the blasts that targeted tourist-packed hotels , warned " all unnecessary travel " to the region should be avoided .
" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .
" and terrorists want to achieve the greatest possible shock value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotional scenes at the frankfurt airport as german tourists return home german holidaymakers returning from sharm el-sheikh arrived back at frankfurt airport in emotional scenes late on saturday .
fifty-three passengers who had booked holidays with the giant german tour operator tui returned on a flight from egypt , some in tears . other flights carrying germans were arriving throughout the day . german chancellor gerhard schröder said the attacks " showed disdain for human life " and had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike . " " the horrible attacks of recent weeks demand even more intensive international cooperation , in order to dismantle terrorist networks that are even more cruel , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de egypt hit by deadly bomb blasts suicide car bombers unleashed a trail of carnage in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh saturday , killing at least 83 people , including tourists from britain , italy and holland and injuring german nationals .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism the world according to merkel unemployment election 2005 -pipe- 24.07.2005 economy set to dominate german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 'll handle the economy better ?
that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism the world according to merkel unemployment election 2005 -pipe- 24.07.2005 economy set to dominate german election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 'll handle the economy better ?
that 's the question on voters ' minds now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits . with so much at stake - " our future and the future of our children " was how german president horst köhler put it - big promises are being made by both the governing coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties under chancellor gerhard schröder and the opposition christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parties under angela merkel . but experts are skeptical that whoever wins the election on september 18 will have the courage to push through the very painful reforms needed to bring down unemployment , kick-start growth and rein in the public deficit in the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " our country is facing immense tasks , " köhler diagnosed on national television on thursday evening . " the federal and regional state budgets are in an unprecedentedly critical state .
we have too few children and we 're getting older .
and we have to hold our own amid fierce global competition . " during schröder 's past two terms in office , the german jobless queues have swelled to a postwar record of five million , economic growth has been stuck close to zero and public finances , burdened by the never-ending costs of unification , have deteriorated dramatically . but despite his disastrous showing in the polls , schröder has vowed to win the election by sticking to his current course of - so far unpopular - healthcare , pension and labor market reforms . " germany is on the right track and more and more people are beginning to recognize that fact , " he said . big merkel lead the wider population does not appear to think so . opinion polls show merkel and the cdu / csu parties 17 percentage points ahead of schröder and the sdp , suggesting germany is set to get its first-ever female chancellor in the autumn . and a snap poll by ard public television on thursday showed that only one person in five believes that schröder will be re-elected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder germany 's economic problems are in fact putting schröder , nicknamed a " comrade of the bosses " for his previously centrist policies , in something of an ideological quandary . faced with a rebellion by the left-wing of the spd and the creation of a separate new left-wing party that could sap vital votes , schröder has staged a distinct shift to the left , rediscovering people 's sense of " social responsibility . " his latest proposals include supplementary taxation for the super-rich ; a basic mandatory health insurance for all , rich and poor alike ; and maintenance of the current system of co-determination in german companies where unions have nearly equal say with management in business decisions . merkel has no such ideological qualms . she has pledged to undertake " serious structural reforms , including painful shake-up of the labor markets . " ready for serious reform ? but it is hard to imagine that an electorate angered by schröder 's attempts to shake up the economy will be any more prepared to stomach merkel 's plans for a two-percentage-point hike in value-added -lrb- or sales -rrb- tax from january 1 , an easing of the labor laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers , and a flat-rate health insurance premium for all , from cleaner to company director . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel has also indicated that while the taxation system would be simplified , tax cuts were not on the agenda before 2007 in view of the tight state of germany 's public finances . yet german business appears confident that a change in government will provide a way out of the country 's current economic impasse .

the incident has left some in europe asking where in the world it is safe to go on holiday . the bombs that ripped through shopping and hotel areas in the red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in egypt 's worst attack since 1981 have killed at least 88 people among them foreign tourists vacationing there . two britons , two italians , one ukrainian , one russian , one dutch citizen and one israeli of arab descent died in the blasts , egyptian sources told afp .
the czech republic later reported one of its nationals had died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel was reduced to rubble the egyptian resort which as well as being a top tourist resort is also regularly used for high-level summits and international conferences . shaken tourists spoke of mass panic and hysteria as people fled the carnage in the early hours of saturday , with bodies strewn across the roads , people screaming and sirens wailing . " barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .
" it would play into the hands of terrorists , " sergei sinitsyn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks among the debris in front of gazala gardens hotel the netherlands advised its nationals to stay close to beaches and stick to well marked roads in sinai but did not suggest planned trips should be abandoned . but sweden , denmark and italy told travelers to cancel any planned visits to the sinai peninsula . denmark , which said two of its nationals had been slightly hurt in the blasts that targeted tourist-packed hotels , warned " all unnecessary travel " to the region should be avoided .
" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .

the czech republic later reported one of its nationals had died . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ghazala gardens hotel was reduced to rubble the egyptian resort which as well as being a top tourist resort is also regularly used for high-level summits and international conferences . shaken tourists spoke of mass panic and hysteria as people fled the carnage in the early hours of saturday , with bodies strewn across the roads , people screaming and sirens wailing . " barbaric threat " and " senseless acts " the attacks have sparked angry condemnation from around the world . in europe , from where tens of thousands tourists travel to egypt , the attacks only added to a sense of crisis triggered by the july 7 london bombings and follow-up attacks this week . british foreign secretary jack straw said he could not rule out links to the london attacks . " almost certainly they are evil people who will claim wrongly to have done this in the name of islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard in front of wreckages of cars in the old market in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh in paris , french president chirac stressed the world 's " absolute determination to fight this scourge , " while german foreign minister joschka fischer denounced the " blind and fanatical hatred " of the terrorists . russian president vladimir putin called on countries which have suffered such attacks to stand united against terrorism , saying that could be the only response to " this barbaric threat . " in rome italian president carlo azeglio ciampi called the attacks " tragic , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said they were " barbaric , " while eu commission chief jose manuel barroso described them as " cowardly . " pope benedict xvi said he was deeply saddened by these " senseless acts . " european capitals divided over response though many foreigners have begun to leave egypt , some european governments said they were n't explicitly warning their nationals against traveling to egypt . british foreign secretary jack straw said britons were not being warned against traveling to egypt despite the bomb attacks . " we are asking other countries not to say ' do n't travel to the united kingdom ' , despite the fact that we have suffered these two very serious terrorist attacks in the last three weeks , " he said . " we 're saying to people , ' yes , we all know there is a threat of terrorism in egypt , but there 's a threat of terrorism across europe and in the united kingdom so be aware of that threat ' . " an official from the russian government 's tourism department said russia would not be advising its citizens to avoid egypt , the itar-tass news agency reported .
" it would play into the hands of terrorists , " sergei sinitsyn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman walks among the debris in front of gazala gardens hotel the netherlands advised its nationals to stay close to beaches and stick to well marked roads in sinai but did not suggest planned trips should be abandoned . but sweden , denmark and italy told travelers to cancel any planned visits to the sinai peninsula . denmark , which said two of its nationals had been slightly hurt in the blasts that targeted tourist-packed hotels , warned " all unnecessary travel " to the region should be avoided .
" tourists are advised to stay in their hotels until further notice and follow the instructions of the local authorities , " the danish foreign ministry said , although there were no immediate plans to evacuate the roughly 650 danes vacationing in the sharm el-sheik area . italy 's foreign ministry advised italians not to travel to the area , prompting cancellations in massive numbers , according to travel agencies .
italians are normally among the resort 's most faithful visitors . thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel agency , announced on saturday all its flights to sharm el-sheikh would be suspended .
the german-based company said all journeys to egypt this summer could be changed for no cost until august 6 and that clients could choose another destination or postpone their trip . france asked any of its nationals in sharm el-sheikh to report to french authorities at the scene , and urged citizens to " exercise the greatest caution " if traveling to egypt in the coming days .
the foreign ministry set up a crisis cell and a hotline number for those seeking information about loved ones vacationing in egypt . french tour operators reported about half the passengers planning to go to the area had decided to call off their trips but others already in cairo wanted to go head with plans to visit sharm el-sheikh . where is it safe to go on holiday ? a german sunday newspaper asked where in the world it was safe to go on holiday following the wave of bombings .
the attacks on saturday in which german holidaymakers were among the injured came one week after a suicide bombing killed five people in a turkish aegean resort , another popular destination for german sun-seekers . " where is it still safe to go on holiday ? , " the bild am sonntag asked in a front-page headline . pointing out that the bombings of trains and a bus in london had shown that even trips to other western european capitals were not without risk , bild offered travelers a 15-point checklist to consult before they go abroad .
it included the advice that foreign visitors are statistically safer if they stay in small hotels rather than large complexes such as the ghazala garden hotel which was destroyed in the main sharm el-sheikh bomb . rolf tophoven , an expert from a german institute which specializes in researching the risks to tourists told bild : " the bigger the hotel , the higher the number of deaths and injuries .
" and terrorists want to achieve the greatest possible shock value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emotional scenes at the frankfurt airport as german tourists return home german holidaymakers returning from sharm el-sheikh arrived back at frankfurt airport in emotional scenes late on saturday .
fifty-three passengers who had booked holidays with the giant german tour operator tui returned on a flight from egypt , some in tears . other flights carrying germans were arriving throughout the day . german chancellor gerhard schröder said the attacks " showed disdain for human life " and had targeted " innocent people , egyptians and foreign tourists alike . " " the horrible attacks of recent weeks demand even more intensive international cooperation , in order to dismantle terrorist networks that are even more cruel , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de egypt hit by deadly bomb blasts suicide car bombers unleashed a trail of carnage in egypt 's red sea resort of sharm el-sheikh saturday , killing at least 83 people , including tourists from britain , italy and holland and injuring german nationals .

politicians want to rethink the army 's role and consider deploying it within the country . friday 's crash of a small ultralight aircraft between the german parliament building and the chancellor 's office and the recent spate of deadly bombings in london and most recently in egypt have heightened security worries in berlin .
the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .

the former however was not linked in any way to a terrorist attack with police saying that the pilot - the only person on board - who was killed in the crash - probably committed suicide due to personal problems . but , politicians of all stripes jumped into a widening debate over the weekend over whether germany needed extra measures to provide security to its population particularly at a time of a seeming raised threat of islamic terrorism in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning plane in front of the german parliament on friday in a reference to the plane crash scare in berlin , günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister and member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the german army or bundeswehr must be in a position to monitor flight bans . " we have to check the deployment of antiaircraft missiles and fighter helicopters in order to deal with every flying object , " beckstein told german newspaper berliner morgenpost .
he stressed that technical conditions had to be improved because radar so far can only register flying objects up to a height of 300 meters . even dieter wiefelspütz , domestic security expert of the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , demanded a tightening of military security in berlin 's government district . " due to the special interests of the capital , military securing of airspace has to be stepped up .
what 's necessary is the aerial preparedness of the bundeswehr with fighter helicopters in berlin , " wiefelspütz said .
he added that technical conditions such as radar control had to be improved in order to better map low-flying objects . jumping to rash conclusions ? however , the bundeswehr has warned against jumping to rash conclusions as a result of friday 's crash of a small plane in front of the parliament building in berlin and over dramatizing the situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier in the german bundeswehr hans-joachim schubert , commander of the nato air defense center in kalkar , said friday 's crash did n't warrant deploying the bundeswehr within the country . schubert said that though small light planes could not be registered by radar control , their destructive potential could not be compared to bigger machines .
he added that the bundeswehr was well prepared for attacks on the scale that took place in new york in 2001 .
schubert added that the only way to prevent small aircraft from flying too close to sensitive areas was by designating " general non-flying areas " or by protecting individual buildings . german defense minister peter struck also said that he was against the deployment of the bundeswehr domestically .
" the bundeswehr is responsible for providing protection outside , the police for domestic security - it 's going to remain that way . " struck added that where police capabilities were stretched as in a possible " terrorist attack by air , " there were additional legal regulations .
" besides , the bundeswehr is always at any given time available within officially defined parameters for cases of accidents and catastrophe , " struck said . " no more taboos " angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who is widely expected to become chancellor in federal elections in september - had set the discussion on the domestic deployment of the bundeswehr rolling in light of the terrorist attacks in london and egypt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " if danger levels demand it , there should not be any taboos on considering whether the bundeswehr can take over new responsibilities , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.07.2005 armstrong wins tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong is the only person to have won the tour seven times lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career . the 33-year-old discovery channel team rider finished the race with a 4min 40sec lead on italian ivan basso with germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , finishing third on the podium at 6:21 behind armstrong . alexandre vinokourov of kazakhstan , who rides for ullrich 's t-mobile team , won the 21st and final stage after pulling ahead of australian brad mcgee in the last 200 metres on the champs elysees .
it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .
if he changes that , he wins .
it 's not a criticism .

it was vinokourov 's second stage win of this year 's race after his stunning win on the second day in the alps on stage 11 . michael rasmussen of the rabobank team managed to avoid any mishaps and secured the polka dot jersey for the race 's best climber while norwegian thor hushovd of credit agricole won the points classification whose prize is the green jersey .
yaroslav popovych , of armstrong 's discovery channel team , won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider in the general classification aged 25 years or under . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour 2005 : armstrong , basso und ullrich armstrong came into the race as a favorite despite his imminent retirement , which he decided on a few months ago . and the american made sure he gave his rivals no quarter with a time trial performance on the first stage which left ullrich and basso playing catch-up at over a minute behind . ullrich , a five-time runner-up , has now claimed his sixth podium place on the race .
the 31-year-old t-mobile team leader came fourth last year - the first time in his career he had finished off the podium . ullrich 's team tried in vain to attack armstrong in the mountains , and from the first day in the alps he was left with a huge deficit of four minutes to the american who finished second behind spaniard alejandro valverde on stage 10 from briancon to courchevel . in the remainder of the race armstrong simply asked his discovery channel team to counter any attacks , and he did not strike himself until the 55.5km time trial in st etienne on the penultimate day . armstrong won the race against the clock 23 seconds ahead of ullrich to claim his first stage of the race and the 22nd on the tour de france which he has participated in 11 times . on the final stage from the suburbs of paris to the finish line at the world famous champs elysees , armstrong avoided a potential disaster when he narrowly missed crashing before they had arrived in the capital . the roads were slippery after a night of rain and his teammate george hincapie , who won the most difficult climbing stage of the race last week , came crashing down on a right hand turn .
two other discovery riders followed suit and armstrong had to brake to avoid the same fate . once into the capital , however , the sprinters teams eventually took over the race .
with the green jersey still to play for , as well as the prestigious final stage of the race , there were numerous attacks in the final few kilometers . taking life easy armstrong admitted earlier that he will now be taking life easy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance armstrong and his girlfriend us singer sheryl crow " we 're going to fly to the south of france and go to the beach for a week , and play with the kids on the beach and drink wine and eat lots of food , " said armstrong , whose girlfriend is rock star sheryl crow . " this job is stressful , and this race is stressful so hopefully the next week will be a preview of what my life will be like for the next 50 years , although i ca n't promise i wo n't show up at a few cyclo-cross events or mountain bike or triathlon races .
" i 'm an athlete .
i 've been competing in swimming and running events since i was 12 years old . " armstrong 's first victory on this year 's race was his 22nd stage victory from the tour in 11 participations .
and despite dominating his rivals to the extent that he could probably win the tough three-week race with relative ease next year , he affirmed that now was the right time to hang up his bike . " i 'm more convinced -lrb- about retiring -rrb- now than i 've ever been , " said armstrong .
" there was no pressure for victory , it was just something i wanted , as a sportsman , to go out on top .
that was the only incentive and only pressure . " biggest sporting comeback bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong , whose stunning comeback from cancer in 1997 to win the tour 18 months later is considered one of the biggest sporting comebacks ever , admitted he has achieved feats beyond his wildest dreams . " i 've had an unbelievable career .
i 've been blessed to have a 14-year career , to have won the tour de france seven times after my illness .
now , i 'm blessed with financial rewards i never thought were possible and my life and the life of my kids is going to be comfortable . " with the likes of basso a likely yellow jersey favorite next year and ullrich , who finished third on sunday , still able contenders for the tour de france , armstrong admitted that , at the age of 33 , time was not on his side . " nobody can tell you what happens year after year , but at some point you turn 34 and 35 , then others make a big step up and when your age catches up you take a big step down , " he added . " i could have stopped it after six , but discovery channel came in with a three-year deal .
i had to live up to my promise .
last year there were a lot of things at stake , the sixth victory that would break the record , for example , but this year there was nothing on the line , not one penny . " " jan is special " armstrong 's lead in the general classification has left many wondering why he is retiring . but the american said he wo n't be worrying about who is winning the race in is absence next year .
" it 's nice to win with a cushion , but it would n't be fair to next year 's winner to say ' you 're lucky i did n't show up ' .
let 's just watch next year 's race and let the champion be the champion , " he said . whoever that champion is remains to be seen .
with armstrong gone , there will be plenty of contenders - although the texan may well be putting his money on basso , or ullrich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich " jan is special .
he 's a special guy to meet , and a special rival .
and i 've not been bullshitting when i 've said he 's the scariest guy in the group .
i believe he can win the tour again , and not just once , " said armstrong , who believes the 1997 winner will have an even better chance if he takes some of his advice . " but he has to show up in a little better shape .
a kilo and a half less at the start and better preparation , and he can win .
" it 's just the first 10 days -lrb- of the race -rrb- .

the war and peace show , at the hop farm country park , paddock wood , is in its 23rd year .
it features displays of more than 3,500 tanks and military vehicles as well as live battle re-enactments .
the poppies are part of a service of thanksgiving attended by nearly 300 war veterans from the south east .
a piper seneca pa34 aircraft is dropping the petals onto the veterans ' parade .
one of the main organisers was 85-year-old albert figg , a normandy veteran originally from wiltshire but now living in canterbury .
he landed in france on 24 june 1944 with the 43rd wessex division of the 112 field regiment royal artillery .
mr figg told the bbc news website that he felt " a little bit overwhelmed " at being involved in the wwii anniversary celebrations .
a show spokeswoman said the parade and service were a " nice touch at the end of the event " .

bbc northern ireland security editor brian rowan said there were new indications that the ira 's response could come within days .
he said he understood that discussions were continuing both inside the ira and between sinn fein and both governments .
