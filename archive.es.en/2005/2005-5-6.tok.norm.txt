in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2005 homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are believers in the effects of the little white pills while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science . homeopathy is one of the most popular complementary therapies , with about 100,000 physicians practising it globally .
in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .
that would help guarantee access to a variety of therapies in the national health system , steuernagel said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

shortly thereafter , ratzinger changed his name to pope benedict xvi , succeeding the late pope john paul ii , and sending halbe on his way to some serious cash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proof : a bill of sale to cardinal ratzinger on may 5 , the day of the acension , halbe 's silver-gray golf sold for 188,938.88 euros on ebay .
the winning bidder was an american online casino , which contacted halbe minutes later to ask about his bank details .
" i am more than happy that i was able to sell it for such a sum , " said halbe , surrounded by friends , some of whom helped him come up with the plan to auction off the volkswagen .
more cash passed up of course , it could have gone for much more .
had ebay not experienced a server crash 40 minutes before the final bell sounded , the price would have likely continued upward .
" i feel completely deceived , " said helmut drossman , an ad agency chief from bavaria who was unable to bid on the car in the final minutes .
" i 'm frustrated , because we could have offered significantly more than the final price , " said thorsten senneke , who bid for a group of investors , according to the news agency dpa .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi was most likely chauffered around in the car but a re-sale price of almost 10 times what he paid for is not half-bad either .
halbe , who earns a little bit of money doing his required civil service duty , plans to spend his hard-earned money on a new car , maybe a vacation " and put the rest in a bank . "
as for the online casino that won the bid , it will have to be careful not to promise too much in advertising the former pope mobile .
ratzinger never had a driver 's license and , by all accounts , he owned the car for little less than a year . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw golf for sale : one papal owner it does n't promise to save those on the highway to hell or put the new owner on the expressway to heaven but the modest six year-old vw golf making waves on ebay does have something of the divine about it .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .
that would help guarantee access to a variety of therapies in the national health system , steuernagel said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

the move comes after the eu warned china to reduce its clothing exports to europe or face enforced limits .
the united states has also launched a similar investigation .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .
that 's completely different than the situation in norway , for example , where most are children of simple german soldiers .
here there are still strong feelings of guilt . " but she said after having written her book , she received many calls from people wanting to know more , and who were interested in researching their own pasts .
according to her , there is still a lot about the lebensborn era that is shrouded in secrecy and shame , and is just now coming to light . " there is still a great need among many of these children to know more about their history , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .
that 's completely different than the situation in norway , for example , where most are children of simple german soldiers .
here there are still strong feelings of guilt . " but she said after having written her book , she received many calls from people wanting to know more , and who were interested in researching their own pasts .
according to her , there is still a lot about the lebensborn era that is shrouded in secrecy and shame , and is just now coming to light .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .

it was a place that offered an attractive alternative to a home or hospital birth to many women , especially single ones . at that time , being an unwed mother carried an enormous social stigma and could even result in a woman being fired from some jobs , not to mention ostracized from her family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2005 himmler 's children back to first page back 2/2 norse ideal however , in one country , the lebensborn registers , which are more complete , show some 12,000 babies came into the world there fathered by members of the german occupying forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway was one of the center stages of the program and the nazis set up 10 maternity homes there .
the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .
that 's completely different than the situation in norway , for example , where most are children of simple german soldiers .
here there are still strong feelings of guilt . " but she said after having written her book , she received many calls from people wanting to know more , and who were interested in researching their own pasts .
according to her , there is still a lot about the lebensborn era that is shrouded in secrecy and shame , and is just now coming to light . " there is still a great need among many of these children to know more about their history , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

instead , its legacy is thousands of destroyed lives , broken families and stories of personal shame . " there are still a lot of myths around the lebensborn program , that for example , they were breeding centers for the ss , " said dorothee schmitz-köster , who wrote a book on the program called " german mother , are you prepared ? "

" is the title of the book on lebensborn centers not stud farms despite the stubborn belief that the lebensborn program was about bringing blond-haired ss officers together with rosy-cheeked german girls for the sake of baby-making , the real story is somewhat less titillating . since the beginning of the 20th century , the birth rate in germany had been falling and ss chief heinrich himmler -lrb- photo -rrb- wanted to reverse the trend , especially as he must have known germany was soon to have more territory that would need to be populated by those the nazis deemed genetically acceptable - healthy , white , non-jewish , preferably nordic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler in 1935 , he formed the lebensborn association and two years later opened the first maternity home in bavaria , in steinhöring outside of munich .
it was a place that offered an attractive alternative to a home or hospital birth to many women , especially single ones . at that time , being an unwed mother carried an enormous social stigma and could even result in a woman being fired from some jobs , not to mention ostracized from her family .
the lebensborn homes offered unwed mothers a place to go have their baby in secret , in pleasant surroundings , with top-notch pre-natal care . " we were treated like princesses , " reminisced one woman in an interview who brought her baby into the world at one of the homes . " i continue to find it fascinating how intelligently the nazis enacted their policies , " schmitz-köster said .
" they entered into this moral hornet 's nest , the issue of unwed mothers , and made women a very attractive offer that fit perfectly with their own social goals . " with the lebensborn homes , himmler could ensure that these women did not abort their babies and therefore could keep the country 's birth rate up .
at the same time it allowed him to pursue his goal of creating a future nation of " racially pure " people . genetic criteria of course , not every woman was accepted into the homes .
a woman did not have to show a marriage certificate , but she and the father did have to provide documentation that they were " aryan " and healthy .
in fact , the proof of racial suitability had to extend back to both parents ' grandparents . those with jewish kin , a disability or genetic disease , or a connection with any of the other " undesirable " groups would find the lebensborn doors slammed in their faces .
and although most babies who were born in the homes received high-quality care , those children born disabled were sometimes dispatched to euthanasia clinics where they were poisoned or starved to death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a walk with the children at a lebensborn home while many of the women in the homes were unwed mothers , who were granted anonymity and whose births were not recorded on official registered , wives of higher-ranking party members also often chose the lebensborn program to carry out their pregnancies . it 's not clear exactly how many children were born in the homes , since official records were kept only in special lebensborn registers , many of which of burned in the closing days of the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2005 blair wins historic third term großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh mandate for labor - with reduced support prime minister tony blair said friday his labor party had won a new mandate to govern britain but must " respond wisely " to voters who gave it another term in power with a reduced majority . " we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback .

" we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback . " we have landed a good hard punch on mr blair 's nose , " said alex deane , chief of staff for tim collins , education spokesman for the conservative party . iraq war lost labout votes foreign secretary jack straw admitted on bbc television : " i do n't think there 's any doubt that iraq played a part in the reduction in votes -lrb- for labor -rrb- .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2005 homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are believers in the effects of the little white pills while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science . homeopathy is one of the most popular complementary therapies , with about 100,000 physicians practising it globally .
in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2005 germany marks 50 years in nato großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe " in may 1955 , europe 's military blocs were laid down when west germany joined nato and east germany became part of the soviet 's warsaw pact , resulting in two german armies which opposed each other until 1989 . joining nato gave west germany binding ties to the west , as well as the military protection of the united states .
and for nato , which was founded in 1949 , the move was equally important .
the former west germany was a key area of concentration along the iron curtain which divided europe into its eastern and western blocs , and it was strategically important that west germany be integrated in the west both politically and militarily . by the time west germany joined the north atlantic treaty organization on may 6 , 1955 , france had gradually let go of its original concerns about entrusting an armed forces to germany - it was , after all , just 10 years since the brutal end of world war ii .
but 50 years ago , west germany had no army to speak of - this was slowly built up over the ensuing years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divided germany : a poster for the warsaw pact only eight days later , on may 14 , 1955 , east germany became a founding member of the warsaw pact , the soviet-led military alliance .
on a visit to nato headquarters in brussels earlier this year , german president horst köhler called nato 's development at the time " life-sustaining . " " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe , " köhler said .
" the alliance partners , and especially the united states , gave us germans the calming certainty that friendly nations wholeheartedly stood for peace and freedom in our country . " defending nato 's ideals after german reunification in 1990 , the former east germany also became a part of nato .
in 1995 , the german military participated in a nato-led foreign operation for the first time - in the former yugoslavia .

and for nato , which was founded in 1949 , the move was equally important .
the former west germany was a key area of concentration along the iron curtain which divided europe into its eastern and western blocs , and it was strategically important that west germany be integrated in the west both politically and militarily . by the time west germany joined the north atlantic treaty organization on may 6 , 1955 , france had gradually let go of its original concerns about entrusting an armed forces to germany - it was , after all , just 10 years since the brutal end of world war ii .
but 50 years ago , west germany had no army to speak of - this was slowly built up over the ensuing years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divided germany : a poster for the warsaw pact only eight days later , on may 14 , 1955 , east germany became a founding member of the warsaw pact , the soviet-led military alliance .
on a visit to nato headquarters in brussels earlier this year , german president horst köhler called nato 's development at the time " life-sustaining . " " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe , " köhler said .
" the alliance partners , and especially the united states , gave us germans the calming certainty that friendly nations wholeheartedly stood for peace and freedom in our country . " defending nato 's ideals after german reunification in 1990 , the former east germany also became a part of nato .
in 1995 , the german military participated in a nato-led foreign operation for the first time - in the former yugoslavia .
today , around 5,000 german soldiers are serving under the nato flag , mainly in afghanistan and kosovo . " politically , germany had come a very long way before it decided to take part in a nato peacekeeping operation outside of german territory , " said köhler .
" in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany now makes up the largest contingent of soldiers and staff , and is making an invaluable contribution . " germany is the biggest contributor of troops for foreign missions and , after the us , the second biggest financial contributor to nato .

that once harmonious relationship now bears deep scars .
at the last nato summit in february , german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded more say for the europeans in nato 's decisions . " i have the impression that nato and the other european institutions are very interested in improving the transatlantic dialogue , also when it comes to a pending decision " schröder said .
" we can only defend together what we have also decided together . " fifty years after the former west germany 's entry in nato , the organization 's role has changed dramatically .
the main focus is no longer on deterring enemies threatening to start a nuclear war .
rather , nato 's priority is defending common values and security interests all over the world .
its forces have been transformed into flexible units capable of responding quickly to a crisis . for the german army , this has meant a seemingly endless restructuring marathon .

" it must be better " than the other world cups , said former anti-apartheid activist and lawmaker danny jordaan , the head of south africa ’ s organizing committee .
" it must be african and world class . "
the 2010 world cup will mark the first time that world 's most-watched tournament will be held on african soil and the biggest international event ever staged in south africa .
jordaan told afp that fifa president sepp blatter had informed his team during a visit in january that the 2010 world cup stood a chance of being more financially successful than the 2006 event in germany .
the 2010 world cup promises to be more than just a sports event , said jordaan , pointing to the 1998 tournament in france as a trendsetter in that approach .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

eu trade commissioner , peter mandelson said the inquiry should take at most 60 days and could result in the introduction of possible safeguard measures .
the move comes after the eu warned china to reduce its clothing exports to europe or face enforced limits .
the united states has also launched a similar investigation .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

the e-mail worm is part of a bigger virus , also known as sober.p , which has spread to more than 30 countries since monday , affecting mainly the united states and south america . " we have reports from over 30 countries so far in the first 13 or 14 hours since the spread of the virus on monday , " mikko hyppoenen , head of anti-virus research at finnish firm f-secure , told afp . internet security firm trend micro placed sober.s in its ' red alert ' category , saying that " using social engineering techniques , it sends out an e-mail supposedly sent by the soccer organization fifa , " offering tickets to the 2006 tournament in germany .
the e-mail includes correct contact information for a fifa official .
us firm mcafee classified the worm as a " medium risk . " worm suspected of coming from germany world cup organizers have warned fans that the virus will appear as a ticketing confirmation message from the addresses ticket @ fifa.de and gewinn @ fifa.de and that attachments should not be opened . the worm spreads through e-mail attachments as a " .zip " file .
the messages are written in english or german , and the creator of the worm is believed to come from a german-speaking country , hyppoenen said . he said there were no estimates for how many computers had been infected so far , and warned users to exercise caution in opening e-mail attachments since the infected e-mails will appear to come from a person they know . most anti-virus systems have already been updated to protect users , hyppoenen said .

" europe deemed relatively safe from virus the impact of the virus is expected to be relatively limited since it was released on monday at 8:00 pm local time in germany -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- , when most users in europe had shut down their computers for the day . " most anti-virus systems had time to update " before users switched on their computers on tuesday morning , hyppoenen said .
but because of the time difference to the americas , the united states and south america were harder hit .
hyppoenen added that experts had not yet determined the virus-writer 's motive . worm provides way in for hacker " the worm will install a back door so the virus writer can gain access to the infected computer .
we do n't know yet what his motive is .
it could be to attack websites or to send spam , " he said . the first phase of world cup ticket sales was over-subscribed by 10 times and those fans who were successful in the lottery have already been informed .
the second phase , selling only team specific tickets -lrb- tsts -rrb- on a first come first served basis , began on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2005 homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are believers in the effects of the little white pills while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science . homeopathy is one of the most popular complementary therapies , with about 100,000 physicians practising it globally .
in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .
that would help guarantee access to a variety of therapies in the national health system , steuernagel said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases .

in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .

the e-mail includes correct contact information for a fifa official .
us firm mcafee classified the worm as a " medium risk . " worm suspected of coming from germany world cup organizers have warned fans that the virus will appear as a ticketing confirmation message from the addresses ticket @ fifa.de and gewinn @ fifa.de and that attachments should not be opened . the worm spreads through e-mail attachments as a " .zip " file .
the messages are written in english or german , and the creator of the worm is believed to come from a german-speaking country , hyppoenen said . he said there were no estimates for how many computers had been infected so far , and warned users to exercise caution in opening e-mail attachments since the infected e-mails will appear to come from a person they know . most anti-virus systems have already been updated to protect users , hyppoenen said .
" all you need to do is update your anti-virus system . " europe deemed relatively safe from virus the impact of the virus is expected to be relatively limited since it was released on monday at 8:00 pm local time in germany -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- , when most users in europe had shut down their computers for the day . " most anti-virus systems had time to update " before users switched on their computers on tuesday morning , hyppoenen said .
but because of the time difference to the americas , the united states and south america were harder hit .
hyppoenen added that experts had not yet determined the virus-writer 's motive . worm provides way in for hacker " the worm will install a back door so the virus writer can gain access to the infected computer .
we do n't know yet what his motive is .
it could be to attack websites or to send spam , " he said . the first phase of world cup ticket sales was over-subscribed by 10 times and those fans who were successful in the lottery have already been informed .
the second phase , selling only team specific tickets -lrb- tsts -rrb- on a first come first served basis , began on monday .
fans buying those tickets receive immediate confirmation at the end of their booking . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu upholds world cup ticket complaint the much-maligned world cup ticketing system took another blow on monday when the european commission upheld a complaint from a consumer group which claimed the system was discriminative .

he immediately called for an end to chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , saying their time was over .

" i agree with foreign minister -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer that we should take up this issue in nato committees , " struck said during a visit to the us air base ramstein in western germany .
when asked whether he backed calls by members of the ruling coalition for a total withdrawal of the us weapons , struck said : " we will have to discuss that with the other european allies that also still have nuclear weapons stationed . "
during an international conference in new york this week to review the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , fischer said that calls from his greens party and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats for a removal of all us nuclear weapons stationed in germany were " a reasonable initiative . "
struck noted that " 95 percent of the nuclear weapons stationed in europe were withdrawn after the fall of the berlin wall " in 1989 .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2005 blair wins historic third term großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh mandate for labor - with reduced support prime minister tony blair said friday his labor party had won a new mandate to govern britain but must " respond wisely " to voters who gave it another term in power with a reduced majority . " we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback . " we have landed a good hard punch on mr blair 's nose , " said alex deane , chief of staff for tim collins , education spokesman for the conservative party . iraq war lost labout votes foreign secretary jack straw admitted on bbc television : " i do n't think there 's any doubt that iraq played a part in the reduction in votes -lrb- for labor -rrb- . " blair was keen to fight the election on labor 's stewardship of the robust british economy and the need to press on with much-needed health and education reforms .
but iraq returned to haunt him , especially when he was forced mid-way through the campaign to publish a secret memo from his attorney general that questioned the legality of invading iraq to overthrow saddam hussein . howard branded blair a " liar , " a rare accusation for one british politician to make to another , while liberal democrats chief charles kennedy had hoped to cash in on his party 's anti-war stance . with the election out of the way , blair will be turning his attention to the international stage , as britain takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 and hosts a group of eight summit in scotland on july 6-8 . but he faces yet another daunting challenge , as he has pledged to put the eu constitution , the subject of a closely-fought referendum in france on may 29 , before the famously euroskeptic british public next year . longer term , the outcome of the election raises questions as to whether blair will be able to make good on his desire , announced last year , to serve a full term if re-elected , and then resign .
" this is not good for labor .
this means blair goes quickly , " probably two years into his maximum five-year term , professor richard sennett of the london school of economics -lrb- lse -rrb- told afp . patrick dunleavy , another lse professor , added : " it perhaps suggests that people are happy with a labor government , but unhappy with tony blair because of the iraq war . " shortly after polling stations opened thursday , two grenades - described by police as " novelty-type grenades filled with black powder " - went off outside the british consulate in new york city . no one was injured , but the incident on the other side of the atlantic prompted british police , themselves already on heightened terrorist alert , to bolster their presence in london and elsewhere . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swapping the third way for a third term ?
the third way was billed as the way forward for europe ’ s center-left .
but with tony blair ’ s labour party set to win a third term on right-leaning policies , the question should be : " whatever happened to the third way ? "

" we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .

" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .

the e-mail worm is part of a bigger virus , also known as sober.p , which has spread to more than 30 countries since monday , affecting mainly the united states and south america . " we have reports from over 30 countries so far in the first 13 or 14 hours since the spread of the virus on monday , " mikko hyppoenen , head of anti-virus research at finnish firm f-secure , told afp . internet security firm trend micro placed sober.s in its ' red alert ' category , saying that " using social engineering techniques , it sends out an e-mail supposedly sent by the soccer organization fifa , " offering tickets to the 2006 tournament in germany .
the e-mail includes correct contact information for a fifa official .
us firm mcafee classified the worm as a " medium risk . " worm suspected of coming from germany world cup organizers have warned fans that the virus will appear as a ticketing confirmation message from the addresses ticket @ fifa.de and gewinn @ fifa.de and that attachments should not be opened . the worm spreads through e-mail attachments as a " .zip " file .
the messages are written in english or german , and the creator of the worm is believed to come from a german-speaking country , hyppoenen said . he said there were no estimates for how many computers had been infected so far , and warned users to exercise caution in opening e-mail attachments since the infected e-mails will appear to come from a person they know . most anti-virus systems have already been updated to protect users , hyppoenen said .
" all you need to do is update your anti-virus system . " europe deemed relatively safe from virus the impact of the virus is expected to be relatively limited since it was released on monday at 8:00 pm local time in germany -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- , when most users in europe had shut down their computers for the day . " most anti-virus systems had time to update " before users switched on their computers on tuesday morning , hyppoenen said .
but because of the time difference to the americas , the united states and south america were harder hit .
hyppoenen added that experts had not yet determined the virus-writer 's motive . worm provides way in for hacker " the worm will install a back door so the virus writer can gain access to the infected computer .
we do n't know yet what his motive is .
it could be to attack websites or to send spam , " he said . the first phase of world cup ticket sales was over-subscribed by 10 times and those fans who were successful in the lottery have already been informed .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .
that 's completely different than the situation in norway , for example , where most are children of simple german soldiers .
here there are still strong feelings of guilt . " but she said after having written her book , she received many calls from people wanting to know more , and who were interested in researching their own pasts .
according to her , there is still a lot about the lebensborn era that is shrouded in secrecy and shame , and is just now coming to light . " there is still a great need among many of these children to know more about their history , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .
that 's completely different than the situation in norway , for example , where most are children of simple german soldiers .
here there are still strong feelings of guilt . " but she said after having written her book , she received many calls from people wanting to know more , and who were interested in researching their own pasts .
according to her , there is still a lot about the lebensborn era that is shrouded in secrecy and shame , and is just now coming to light . " there is still a great need among many of these children to know more about their history , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .
that 's completely different than the situation in norway , for example , where most are children of simple german soldiers .
here there are still strong feelings of guilt . " but she said after having written her book , she received many calls from people wanting to know more , and who were interested in researching their own pasts .
according to her , there is still a lot about the lebensborn era that is shrouded in secrecy and shame , and is just now coming to light . " there is still a great need among many of these children to know more about their history , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

instead , its legacy is thousands of destroyed lives , broken families and stories of personal shame . " there are still a lot of myths around the lebensborn program , that for example , they were breeding centers for the ss , " said dorothee schmitz-köster , who wrote a book on the program called " german mother , are you prepared ?

" is the title of the book on lebensborn centers not stud farms despite the stubborn belief that the lebensborn program was about bringing blond-haired ss officers together with rosy-cheeked german girls for the sake of baby-making , the real story is somewhat less titillating . since the beginning of the 20th century , the birth rate in germany had been falling and ss chief heinrich himmler -lrb- photo -rrb- wanted to reverse the trend , especially as he must have known germany was soon to have more territory that would need to be populated by those the nazis deemed genetically acceptable - healthy , white , non-jewish , preferably nordic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler in 1935 , he formed the lebensborn association and two years later opened the first maternity home in bavaria , in steinhöring outside of munich .
it was a place that offered an attractive alternative to a home or hospital birth to many women , especially single ones . at that time , being an unwed mother carried an enormous social stigma and could even result in a woman being fired from some jobs , not to mention ostracized from her family .
the lebensborn homes offered unwed mothers a place to go have their baby in secret , in pleasant surroundings , with top-notch pre-natal care . " we were treated like princesses , " reminisced one woman in an interview who brought her baby into the world at one of the homes . " i continue to find it fascinating how intelligently the nazis enacted their policies , " schmitz-köster said .
" they entered into this moral hornet 's nest , the issue of unwed mothers , and made women a very attractive offer that fit perfectly with their own social goals . " with the lebensborn homes , himmler could ensure that these women did not abort their babies and therefore could keep the country 's birth rate up .
at the same time it allowed him to pursue his goal of creating a future nation of " racially pure " people . genetic criteria of course , not every woman was accepted into the homes .
a woman did not have to show a marriage certificate , but she and the father did have to provide documentation that they were " aryan " and healthy .
in fact , the proof of racial suitability had to extend back to both parents ' grandparents . those with jewish kin , a disability or genetic disease , or a connection with any of the other " undesirable " groups would find the lebensborn doors slammed in their faces .
and although most babies who were born in the homes received high-quality care , those children born disabled were sometimes dispatched to euthanasia clinics where they were poisoned or starved to death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a walk with the children at a lebensborn home while many of the women in the homes were unwed mothers , who were granted anonymity and whose births were not recorded on official registered , wives of higher-ranking party members also often chose the lebensborn program to carry out their pregnancies . it 's not clear exactly how many children were born in the homes , since official records were kept only in special lebensborn registers , many of which of burned in the closing days of the war .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .

the countries ' leaders said in a joint interview that germany was responsible for the war , adding that it also suffered greatly . " even if our generation is not in itself guilty -lrb- for wwii -rrb- we bear the responsibility for all our history , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in the joint interview with russian president vladimir putin , which appeared in the german daily bild on friday . " germany caused and started one of the worst wars in the history of humanity , " he said .
schröder said germans had suffered during and after the war , the end of which meant " the misery of refugees and a new lack of freedom " in the country . putin acknowledged german suffering too .
" of course german civilians suffered but this was neither the soviet union 's nor the red army 's fault .
they did n't start the war , " he said .
" the german people were in many ways victims of a lack of responsibility on behalf of their politicians at that time .
they were poisoned by the ideology of national socialism and led into carnage , " said putin .
" for millions of ordinary germans this military adventure became a personal tragedy . " putin used the bombing of dresden , which was carried out by british and american air forces and led to an estimated civilian death toll of 35,000 , to illustrate his point .
" even today i ca n't begin to comprehend just why dresden was destroyed .
if you look at it in terms of military strategy there was no need for it at the time , " said putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2005 blair wins historic third term großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh mandate for labor - with reduced support prime minister tony blair said friday his labor party had won a new mandate to govern britain but must " respond wisely " to voters who gave it another term in power with a reduced majority . " we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback . " we have landed a good hard punch on mr blair 's nose , " said alex deane , chief of staff for tim collins , education spokesman for the conservative party . iraq war lost labout votes foreign secretary jack straw admitted on bbc television : " i do n't think there 's any doubt that iraq played a part in the reduction in votes -lrb- for labor -rrb- . " blair was keen to fight the election on labor 's stewardship of the robust british economy and the need to press on with much-needed health and education reforms .
but iraq returned to haunt him , especially when he was forced mid-way through the campaign to publish a secret memo from his attorney general that questioned the legality of invading iraq to overthrow saddam hussein . howard branded blair a " liar , " a rare accusation for one british politician to make to another , while liberal democrats chief charles kennedy had hoped to cash in on his party 's anti-war stance . with the election out of the way , blair will be turning his attention to the international stage , as britain takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 and hosts a group of eight summit in scotland on july 6-8 . but he faces yet another daunting challenge , as he has pledged to put the eu constitution , the subject of a closely-fought referendum in france on may 29 , before the famously euroskeptic british public next year . longer term , the outcome of the election raises questions as to whether blair will be able to make good on his desire , announced last year , to serve a full term if re-elected , and then resign .
" this is not good for labor .
this means blair goes quickly , " probably two years into his maximum five-year term , professor richard sennett of the london school of economics -lrb- lse -rrb- told afp . patrick dunleavy , another lse professor , added : " it perhaps suggests that people are happy with a labor government , but unhappy with tony blair because of the iraq war . " shortly after polling stations opened thursday , two grenades - described by police as " novelty-type grenades filled with black powder " - went off outside the british consulate in new york city . no one was injured , but the incident on the other side of the atlantic prompted british police , themselves already on heightened terrorist alert , to bolster their presence in london and elsewhere . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swapping the third way for a third term ?
the third way was billed as the way forward for europe ’ s center-left .

" we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback . " we have landed a good hard punch on mr blair 's nose , " said alex deane , chief of staff for tim collins , education spokesman for the conservative party . iraq war lost labout votes foreign secretary jack straw admitted on bbc television : " i do n't think there 's any doubt that iraq played a part in the reduction in votes -lrb- for labor -rrb- . " blair was keen to fight the election on labor 's stewardship of the robust british economy and the need to press on with much-needed health and education reforms .
but iraq returned to haunt him , especially when he was forced mid-way through the campaign to publish a secret memo from his attorney general that questioned the legality of invading iraq to overthrow saddam hussein . howard branded blair a " liar , " a rare accusation for one british politician to make to another , while liberal democrats chief charles kennedy had hoped to cash in on his party 's anti-war stance . with the election out of the way , blair will be turning his attention to the international stage , as britain takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 and hosts a group of eight summit in scotland on july 6-8 . but he faces yet another daunting challenge , as he has pledged to put the eu constitution , the subject of a closely-fought referendum in france on may 29 , before the famously euroskeptic british public next year . longer term , the outcome of the election raises questions as to whether blair will be able to make good on his desire , announced last year , to serve a full term if re-elected , and then resign .

" shortly after polling stations opened thursday , two grenades - described by police as " novelty-type grenades filled with black powder " - went off outside the british consulate in new york city . no one was injured , but the incident on the other side of the atlantic prompted british police , themselves already on heightened terrorist alert , to bolster their presence in london and elsewhere . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swapping the third way for a third term ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2005 blair wins historic third term großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh mandate for labor - with reduced support prime minister tony blair said friday his labor party had won a new mandate to govern britain but must " respond wisely " to voters who gave it another term in power with a reduced majority . " we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback . " we have landed a good hard punch on mr blair 's nose , " said alex deane , chief of staff for tim collins , education spokesman for the conservative party . iraq war lost labout votes foreign secretary jack straw admitted on bbc television : " i do n't think there 's any doubt that iraq played a part in the reduction in votes -lrb- for labor -rrb- . " blair was keen to fight the election on labor 's stewardship of the robust british economy and the need to press on with much-needed health and education reforms .
but iraq returned to haunt him , especially when he was forced mid-way through the campaign to publish a secret memo from his attorney general that questioned the legality of invading iraq to overthrow saddam hussein . howard branded blair a " liar , " a rare accusation for one british politician to make to another , while liberal democrats chief charles kennedy had hoped to cash in on his party 's anti-war stance . with the election out of the way , blair will be turning his attention to the international stage , as britain takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 and hosts a group of eight summit in scotland on july 6-8 . but he faces yet another daunting challenge , as he has pledged to put the eu constitution , the subject of a closely-fought referendum in france on may 29 , before the famously euroskeptic british public next year . longer term , the outcome of the election raises questions as to whether blair will be able to make good on his desire , announced last year , to serve a full term if re-elected , and then resign .
" this is not good for labor .
this means blair goes quickly , " probably two years into his maximum five-year term , professor richard sennett of the london school of economics -lrb- lse -rrb- told afp . patrick dunleavy , another lse professor , added : " it perhaps suggests that people are happy with a labor government , but unhappy with tony blair because of the iraq war .

" most anti-virus systems had time to update " before users switched on their computers on tuesday morning , hyppoenen said .
but because of the time difference to the americas , the united states and south america were harder hit .
hyppoenen added that experts had not yet determined the virus-writer 's motive . worm provides way in for hacker " the worm will install a back door so the virus writer can gain access to the infected computer .
we do n't know yet what his motive is .
it could be to attack websites or to send spam , " he said . the first phase of world cup ticket sales was over-subscribed by 10 times and those fans who were successful in the lottery have already been informed .

instead , its legacy is thousands of destroyed lives , broken families and stories of personal shame . " there are still a lot of myths around the lebensborn program , that for example , they were breeding centers for the ss , " said dorothee schmitz-köster , who wrote a book on the program called " german mother , are you prepared ? "
" there is almost a pornographic aspect to it in many people 's minds , which meant for decades it simply was n't talked about . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german mother , are you prepared ... " is the title of the book on lebensborn centers not stud farms despite the stubborn belief that the lebensborn program was about bringing blond-haired ss officers together with rosy-cheeked german girls for the sake of baby-making , the real story is somewhat less titillating . since the beginning of the 20th century , the birth rate in germany had been falling and ss chief heinrich himmler -lrb- photo -rrb- wanted to reverse the trend , especially as he must have known germany was soon to have more territory that would need to be populated by those the nazis deemed genetically acceptable - healthy , white , non-jewish , preferably nordic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler in 1935 , he formed the lebensborn association and two years later opened the first maternity home in bavaria , in steinhöring outside of munich .
it was a place that offered an attractive alternative to a home or hospital birth to many women , especially single ones . at that time , being an unwed mother carried an enormous social stigma and could even result in a woman being fired from some jobs , not to mention ostracized from her family .
the lebensborn homes offered unwed mothers a place to go have their baby in secret , in pleasant surroundings , with top-notch pre-natal care . " we were treated like princesses , " reminisced one woman in an interview who brought her baby into the world at one of the homes . " i continue to find it fascinating how intelligently the nazis enacted their policies , " schmitz-köster said .
" they entered into this moral hornet 's nest , the issue of unwed mothers , and made women a very attractive offer that fit perfectly with their own social goals . " with the lebensborn homes , himmler could ensure that these women did not abort their babies and therefore could keep the country 's birth rate up .
at the same time it allowed him to pursue his goal of creating a future nation of " racially pure " people . genetic criteria of course , not every woman was accepted into the homes .
a woman did not have to show a marriage certificate , but she and the father did have to provide documentation that they were " aryan " and healthy .
in fact , the proof of racial suitability had to extend back to both parents ' grandparents . those with jewish kin , a disability or genetic disease , or a connection with any of the other " undesirable " groups would find the lebensborn doors slammed in their faces .
and although most babies who were born in the homes received high-quality care , those children born disabled were sometimes dispatched to euthanasia clinics where they were poisoned or starved to death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a walk with the children at a lebensborn home while many of the women in the homes were unwed mothers , who were granted anonymity and whose births were not recorded on official registered , wives of higher-ranking party members also often chose the lebensborn program to carry out their pregnancies . it 's not clear exactly how many children were born in the homes , since official records were kept only in special lebensborn registers , many of which of burned in the closing days of the war .
schmitz-köster estimates around 6,000 babies were delivered in the 10 homes in germany and the other scattered throughout occupied europe .
others put that number between 7,000 and 8,000 . continue reading to find out more about one european country occupied by the nazis where the program was pursued especially enthusiastically . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

and for nato , which was founded in 1949 , the move was equally important .
the former west germany was a key area of concentration along the iron curtain which divided europe into its eastern and western blocs , and it was strategically important that west germany be integrated in the west both politically and militarily . by the time west germany joined the north atlantic treaty organization on may 6 , 1955 , france had gradually let go of its original concerns about entrusting an armed forces to germany - it was , after all , just 10 years since the brutal end of world war ii .
but 50 years ago , west germany had no army to speak of - this was slowly built up over the ensuing years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divided germany : a poster for the warsaw pact only eight days later , on may 14 , 1955 , east germany became a founding member of the warsaw pact , the soviet-led military alliance .
on a visit to nato headquarters in brussels earlier this year , german president horst köhler called nato 's development at the time " life-sustaining . " " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe , " köhler said .
" the alliance partners , and especially the united states , gave us germans the calming certainty that friendly nations wholeheartedly stood for peace and freedom in our country . " defending nato 's ideals after german reunification in 1990 , the former east germany also became a part of nato .
in 1995 , the german military participated in a nato-led foreign operation for the first time - in the former yugoslavia .
today , around 5,000 german soldiers are serving under the nato flag , mainly in afghanistan and kosovo . " politically , germany had come a very long way before it decided to take part in a nato peacekeeping operation outside of german territory , " said köhler .
" in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany now makes up the largest contingent of soldiers and staff , and is making an invaluable contribution . " germany is the biggest contributor of troops for foreign missions and , after the us , the second biggest financial contributor to nato .
but only once has a german been nato 's general secretary , when manfred wörner served from 1988 to 1994 . split over iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cracks have been paved over , but the iraq war caused a bitter division between us president george w. bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder until the conflict over the iraq war , germany was known in nato for being a loyal ally of the us .
that once harmonious relationship now bears deep scars .
at the last nato summit in february , german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded more say for the europeans in nato 's decisions . " i have the impression that nato and the other european institutions are very interested in improving the transatlantic dialogue , also when it comes to a pending decision " schröder said .
" we can only defend together what we have also decided together . " fifty years after the former west germany 's entry in nato , the organization 's role has changed dramatically .
the main focus is no longer on deterring enemies threatening to start a nuclear war .
rather , nato 's priority is defending common values and security interests all over the world .
its forces have been transformed into flexible units capable of responding quickly to a crisis . for the german army , this has meant a seemingly endless restructuring marathon .
but germany has every reason to stick by the alliance , according to a german general at the brussels headquarters , as germany 's membership in nato signified its return to the civilized world . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .
that 's completely different than the situation in norway , for example , where most are children of simple german soldiers .
here there are still strong feelings of guilt . " but she said after having written her book , she received many calls from people wanting to know more , and who were interested in researching their own pasts .
according to her , there is still a lot about the lebensborn era that is shrouded in secrecy and shame , and is just now coming to light . " there is still a great need among many of these children to know more about their history , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

and for nato , which was founded in 1949 , the move was equally important .
the former west germany was a key area of concentration along the iron curtain which divided europe into its eastern and western blocs , and it was strategically important that west germany be integrated in the west both politically and militarily . by the time west germany joined the north atlantic treaty organization on may 6 , 1955 , france had gradually let go of its original concerns about entrusting an armed forces to germany - it was , after all , just 10 years since the brutal end of world war ii .
but 50 years ago , west germany had no army to speak of - this was slowly built up over the ensuing years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divided germany : a poster for the warsaw pact only eight days later , on may 14 , 1955 , east germany became a founding member of the warsaw pact , the soviet-led military alliance .
on a visit to nato headquarters in brussels earlier this year , german president horst köhler called nato 's development at the time " life-sustaining . " " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe , " köhler said .
" the alliance partners , and especially the united states , gave us germans the calming certainty that friendly nations wholeheartedly stood for peace and freedom in our country . " defending nato 's ideals after german reunification in 1990 , the former east germany also became a part of nato .
in 1995 , the german military participated in a nato-led foreign operation for the first time - in the former yugoslavia .
today , around 5,000 german soldiers are serving under the nato flag , mainly in afghanistan and kosovo . " politically , germany had come a very long way before it decided to take part in a nato peacekeeping operation outside of german territory , " said köhler .
" in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany now makes up the largest contingent of soldiers and staff , and is making an invaluable contribution . " germany is the biggest contributor of troops for foreign missions and , after the us , the second biggest financial contributor to nato .

that once harmonious relationship now bears deep scars .
at the last nato summit in february , german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded more say for the europeans in nato 's decisions . " i have the impression that nato and the other european institutions are very interested in improving the transatlantic dialogue , also when it comes to a pending decision " schröder said .
" we can only defend together what we have also decided together . " fifty years after the former west germany 's entry in nato , the organization 's role has changed dramatically .
the main focus is no longer on deterring enemies threatening to start a nuclear war .
rather , nato 's priority is defending common values and security interests all over the world .
its forces have been transformed into flexible units capable of responding quickly to a crisis . for the german army , this has meant a seemingly endless restructuring marathon .

and for nato , which was founded in 1949 , the move was equally important .
the former west germany was a key area of concentration along the iron curtain which divided europe into its eastern and western blocs , and it was strategically important that west germany be integrated in the west both politically and militarily . by the time west germany joined the north atlantic treaty organization on may 6 , 1955 , france had gradually let go of its original concerns about entrusting an armed forces to germany - it was , after all , just 10 years since the brutal end of world war ii .
but 50 years ago , west germany had no army to speak of - this was slowly built up over the ensuing years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divided germany : a poster for the warsaw pact only eight days later , on may 14 , 1955 , east germany became a founding member of the warsaw pact , the soviet-led military alliance .
on a visit to nato headquarters in brussels earlier this year , german president horst köhler called nato 's development at the time " life-sustaining . " " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe , " köhler said .
" the alliance partners , and especially the united states , gave us germans the calming certainty that friendly nations wholeheartedly stood for peace and freedom in our country . " defending nato 's ideals after german reunification in 1990 , the former east germany also became a part of nato .
in 1995 , the german military participated in a nato-led foreign operation for the first time - in the former yugoslavia .
today , around 5,000 german soldiers are serving under the nato flag , mainly in afghanistan and kosovo . " politically , germany had come a very long way before it decided to take part in a nato peacekeeping operation outside of german territory , " said köhler .
" in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany now makes up the largest contingent of soldiers and staff , and is making an invaluable contribution . " germany is the biggest contributor of troops for foreign missions and , after the us , the second biggest financial contributor to nato .
but only once has a german been nato 's general secretary , when manfred wörner served from 1988 to 1994 . split over iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cracks have been paved over , but the iraq war caused a bitter division between us president george w. bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder until the conflict over the iraq war , germany was known in nato for being a loyal ally of the us .
that once harmonious relationship now bears deep scars .
at the last nato summit in february , german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded more say for the europeans in nato 's decisions . " i have the impression that nato and the other european institutions are very interested in improving the transatlantic dialogue , also when it comes to a pending decision " schröder said .

instead , its legacy is thousands of destroyed lives , broken families and stories of personal shame . " there are still a lot of myths around the lebensborn program , that for example , they were breeding centers for the ss , " said dorothee schmitz-köster , who wrote a book on the program called " german mother , are you prepared ? "
" there is almost a pornographic aspect to it in many people 's minds , which meant for decades it simply was n't talked about . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german mother , are you prepared ... " is the title of the book on lebensborn centers not stud farms despite the stubborn belief that the lebensborn program was about bringing blond-haired ss officers together with rosy-cheeked german girls for the sake of baby-making , the real story is somewhat less titillating . since the beginning of the 20th century , the birth rate in germany had been falling and ss chief heinrich himmler -lrb- photo -rrb- wanted to reverse the trend , especially as he must have known germany was soon to have more territory that would need to be populated by those the nazis deemed genetically acceptable - healthy , white , non-jewish , preferably nordic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler in 1935 , he formed the lebensborn association and two years later opened the first maternity home in bavaria , in steinhöring outside of munich .
it was a place that offered an attractive alternative to a home or hospital birth to many women , especially single ones . at that time , being an unwed mother carried an enormous social stigma and could even result in a woman being fired from some jobs , not to mention ostracized from her family .
the lebensborn homes offered unwed mothers a place to go have their baby in secret , in pleasant surroundings , with top-notch pre-natal care . " we were treated like princesses , " reminisced one woman in an interview who brought her baby into the world at one of the homes . " i continue to find it fascinating how intelligently the nazis enacted their policies , " schmitz-köster said .
" they entered into this moral hornet 's nest , the issue of unwed mothers , and made women a very attractive offer that fit perfectly with their own social goals . " with the lebensborn homes , himmler could ensure that these women did not abort their babies and therefore could keep the country 's birth rate up .
at the same time it allowed him to pursue his goal of creating a future nation of " racially pure " people . genetic criteria of course , not every woman was accepted into the homes .
a woman did not have to show a marriage certificate , but she and the father did have to provide documentation that they were " aryan " and healthy .
in fact , the proof of racial suitability had to extend back to both parents ' grandparents . those with jewish kin , a disability or genetic disease , or a connection with any of the other " undesirable " groups would find the lebensborn doors slammed in their faces .
and although most babies who were born in the homes received high-quality care , those children born disabled were sometimes dispatched to euthanasia clinics where they were poisoned or starved to death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a walk with the children at a lebensborn home while many of the women in the homes were unwed mothers , who were granted anonymity and whose births were not recorded on official registered , wives of higher-ranking party members also often chose the lebensborn program to carry out their pregnancies . it 's not clear exactly how many children were born in the homes , since official records were kept only in special lebensborn registers , many of which of burned in the closing days of the war .
schmitz-köster estimates around 6,000 babies were delivered in the 10 homes in germany and the other scattered throughout occupied europe .
others put that number between 7,000 and 8,000 . continue reading to find out more about one european country occupied by the nazis where the program was pursued especially enthusiastically . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2005 blair wins historic third term großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh mandate for labor - with reduced support prime minister tony blair said friday his labor party had won a new mandate to govern britain but must " respond wisely " to voters who gave it another term in power with a reduced majority . " we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback .

" we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback . " we have landed a good hard punch on mr blair 's nose , " said alex deane , chief of staff for tim collins , education spokesman for the conservative party . iraq war lost labout votes foreign secretary jack straw admitted on bbc television : " i do n't think there 's any doubt that iraq played a part in the reduction in votes -lrb- for labor -rrb- .

" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .

in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .
that would help guarantee access to a variety of therapies in the national health system , steuernagel said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2005 homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are believers in the effects of the little white pills while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science . homeopathy is one of the most popular complementary therapies , with about 100,000 physicians practising it globally .
in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .
that would help guarantee access to a variety of therapies in the national health system , steuernagel said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

and for nato , which was founded in 1949 , the move was equally important .
the former west germany was a key area of concentration along the iron curtain which divided europe into its eastern and western blocs , and it was strategically important that west germany be integrated in the west both politically and militarily . by the time west germany joined the north atlantic treaty organization on may 6 , 1955 , france had gradually let go of its original concerns about entrusting an armed forces to germany - it was , after all , just 10 years since the brutal end of world war ii .
but 50 years ago , west germany had no army to speak of - this was slowly built up over the ensuing years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divided germany : a poster for the warsaw pact only eight days later , on may 14 , 1955 , east germany became a founding member of the warsaw pact , the soviet-led military alliance .
on a visit to nato headquarters in brussels earlier this year , german president horst köhler called nato 's development at the time " life-sustaining . " " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe , " köhler said .
" the alliance partners , and especially the united states , gave us germans the calming certainty that friendly nations wholeheartedly stood for peace and freedom in our country . " defending nato 's ideals after german reunification in 1990 , the former east germany also became a part of nato .
in 1995 , the german military participated in a nato-led foreign operation for the first time - in the former yugoslavia .
today , around 5,000 german soldiers are serving under the nato flag , mainly in afghanistan and kosovo . " politically , germany had come a very long way before it decided to take part in a nato peacekeeping operation outside of german territory , " said köhler .
" in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany now makes up the largest contingent of soldiers and staff , and is making an invaluable contribution . " germany is the biggest contributor of troops for foreign missions and , after the us , the second biggest financial contributor to nato .
but only once has a german been nato 's general secretary , when manfred wörner served from 1988 to 1994 . split over iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cracks have been paved over , but the iraq war caused a bitter division between us president george w. bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder until the conflict over the iraq war , germany was known in nato for being a loyal ally of the us .
that once harmonious relationship now bears deep scars .
at the last nato summit in february , german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded more say for the europeans in nato 's decisions . " i have the impression that nato and the other european institutions are very interested in improving the transatlantic dialogue , also when it comes to a pending decision " schröder said .
" we can only defend together what we have also decided together . " fifty years after the former west germany 's entry in nato , the organization 's role has changed dramatically .
the main focus is no longer on deterring enemies threatening to start a nuclear war .
rather , nato 's priority is defending common values and security interests all over the world .
its forces have been transformed into flexible units capable of responding quickly to a crisis . for the german army , this has meant a seemingly endless restructuring marathon .
but germany has every reason to stick by the alliance , according to a german general at the brussels headquarters , as germany 's membership in nato signified its return to the civilized world . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

and for nato , which was founded in 1949 , the move was equally important .
the former west germany was a key area of concentration along the iron curtain which divided europe into its eastern and western blocs , and it was strategically important that west germany be integrated in the west both politically and militarily . by the time west germany joined the north atlantic treaty organization on may 6 , 1955 , france had gradually let go of its original concerns about entrusting an armed forces to germany - it was , after all , just 10 years since the brutal end of world war ii .
but 50 years ago , west germany had no army to speak of - this was slowly built up over the ensuing years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divided germany : a poster for the warsaw pact only eight days later , on may 14 , 1955 , east germany became a founding member of the warsaw pact , the soviet-led military alliance .
on a visit to nato headquarters in brussels earlier this year , german president horst köhler called nato 's development at the time " life-sustaining . " " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe , " köhler said .
" the alliance partners , and especially the united states , gave us germans the calming certainty that friendly nations wholeheartedly stood for peace and freedom in our country . " defending nato 's ideals after german reunification in 1990 , the former east germany also became a part of nato .
in 1995 , the german military participated in a nato-led foreign operation for the first time - in the former yugoslavia .
today , around 5,000 german soldiers are serving under the nato flag , mainly in afghanistan and kosovo . " politically , germany had come a very long way before it decided to take part in a nato peacekeeping operation outside of german territory , " said köhler .
" in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany now makes up the largest contingent of soldiers and staff , and is making an invaluable contribution . " germany is the biggest contributor of troops for foreign missions and , after the us , the second biggest financial contributor to nato .
but only once has a german been nato 's general secretary , when manfred wörner served from 1988 to 1994 . split over iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cracks have been paved over , but the iraq war caused a bitter division between us president george w. bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder until the conflict over the iraq war , germany was known in nato for being a loyal ally of the us .
that once harmonious relationship now bears deep scars .
at the last nato summit in february , german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded more say for the europeans in nato 's decisions . " i have the impression that nato and the other european institutions are very interested in improving the transatlantic dialogue , also when it comes to a pending decision " schröder said .
" we can only defend together what we have also decided together . " fifty years after the former west germany 's entry in nato , the organization 's role has changed dramatically .
the main focus is no longer on deterring enemies threatening to start a nuclear war .
rather , nato 's priority is defending common values and security interests all over the world .
its forces have been transformed into flexible units capable of responding quickly to a crisis . for the german army , this has meant a seemingly endless restructuring marathon .
but germany has every reason to stick by the alliance , according to a german general at the brussels headquarters , as germany 's membership in nato signified its return to the civilized world . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

the countries ' leaders said in a joint interview that germany was responsible for the war , adding that it also suffered greatly . " even if our generation is not in itself guilty -lrb- for wwii -rrb- we bear the responsibility for all our history , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in the joint interview with russian president vladimir putin , which appeared in the german daily bild on friday . " germany caused and started one of the worst wars in the history of humanity , " he said .
schröder said germans had suffered during and after the war , the end of which meant " the misery of refugees and a new lack of freedom " in the country . putin acknowledged german suffering too .
" of course german civilians suffered but this was neither the soviet union 's nor the red army 's fault .
they did n't start the war , " he said .
" the german people were in many ways victims of a lack of responsibility on behalf of their politicians at that time .
they were poisoned by the ideology of national socialism and led into carnage , " said putin .
" for millions of ordinary germans this military adventure became a personal tragedy . " putin used the bombing of dresden , which was carried out by british and american air forces and led to an estimated civilian death toll of 35,000 , to illustrate his point .
" even today i ca n't begin to comprehend just why dresden was destroyed .
if you look at it in terms of military strategy there was no need for it at the time , " said putin .

" if you consider the horror of the war , the reconciliation between germany and russia is a miracle , " said schröder . " both our peoples , russian and german , have gone through a great deal of drama in their histories .
i believe those experiences have made us all the wiser , " said putin , who concluded that " the historic reconciliation between russians and germans has been achieved . " on sunday , a formal liberation day ceremony commemorating the victory over nazi germany on may 8 , 1945 will take place in berlin .

instead , its legacy is thousands of destroyed lives , broken families and stories of personal shame . " there are still a lot of myths around the lebensborn program , that for example , they were breeding centers for the ss , " said dorothee schmitz-köster , who wrote a book on the program called " german mother , are you prepared ? "
" there is almost a pornographic aspect to it in many people 's minds , which meant for decades it simply was n't talked about . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german mother , are you prepared ... " is the title of the book on lebensborn centers not stud farms despite the stubborn belief that the lebensborn program was about bringing blond-haired ss officers together with rosy-cheeked german girls for the sake of baby-making , the real story is somewhat less titillating . since the beginning of the 20th century , the birth rate in germany had been falling and ss chief heinrich himmler -lrb- photo -rrb- wanted to reverse the trend , especially as he must have known germany was soon to have more territory that would need to be populated by those the nazis deemed genetically acceptable - healthy , white , non-jewish , preferably nordic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler in 1935 , he formed the lebensborn association and two years later opened the first maternity home in bavaria , in steinhöring outside of munich .
it was a place that offered an attractive alternative to a home or hospital birth to many women , especially single ones . at that time , being an unwed mother carried an enormous social stigma and could even result in a woman being fired from some jobs , not to mention ostracized from her family .
the lebensborn homes offered unwed mothers a place to go have their baby in secret , in pleasant surroundings , with top-notch pre-natal care . " we were treated like princesses , " reminisced one woman in an interview who brought her baby into the world at one of the homes . " i continue to find it fascinating how intelligently the nazis enacted their policies , " schmitz-köster said .
" they entered into this moral hornet 's nest , the issue of unwed mothers , and made women a very attractive offer that fit perfectly with their own social goals . " with the lebensborn homes , himmler could ensure that these women did not abort their babies and therefore could keep the country 's birth rate up .
at the same time it allowed him to pursue his goal of creating a future nation of " racially pure " people . genetic criteria of course , not every woman was accepted into the homes .
a woman did not have to show a marriage certificate , but she and the father did have to provide documentation that they were " aryan " and healthy .
in fact , the proof of racial suitability had to extend back to both parents ' grandparents . those with jewish kin , a disability or genetic disease , or a connection with any of the other " undesirable " groups would find the lebensborn doors slammed in their faces .
and although most babies who were born in the homes received high-quality care , those children born disabled were sometimes dispatched to euthanasia clinics where they were poisoned or starved to death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a walk with the children at a lebensborn home while many of the women in the homes were unwed mothers , who were granted anonymity and whose births were not recorded on official registered , wives of higher-ranking party members also often chose the lebensborn program to carry out their pregnancies . it 's not clear exactly how many children were born in the homes , since official records were kept only in special lebensborn registers , many of which of burned in the closing days of the war .
schmitz-köster estimates around 6,000 babies were delivered in the 10 homes in germany and the other scattered throughout occupied europe .
others put that number between 7,000 and 8,000 . continue reading to find out more about one european country occupied by the nazis where the program was pursued especially enthusiastically . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .
that 's completely different than the situation in norway , for example , where most are children of simple german soldiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2005 germany marks 50 years in nato großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe " in may 1955 , europe 's military blocs were laid down when west germany joined nato and east germany became part of the soviet 's warsaw pact , resulting in two german armies which opposed each other until 1989 . joining nato gave west germany binding ties to the west , as well as the military protection of the united states .
and for nato , which was founded in 1949 , the move was equally important .
the former west germany was a key area of concentration along the iron curtain which divided europe into its eastern and western blocs , and it was strategically important that west germany be integrated in the west both politically and militarily . by the time west germany joined the north atlantic treaty organization on may 6 , 1955 , france had gradually let go of its original concerns about entrusting an armed forces to germany - it was , after all , just 10 years since the brutal end of world war ii .
but 50 years ago , west germany had no army to speak of - this was slowly built up over the ensuing years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divided germany : a poster for the warsaw pact only eight days later , on may 14 , 1955 , east germany became a founding member of the warsaw pact , the soviet-led military alliance .
on a visit to nato headquarters in brussels earlier this year , german president horst köhler called nato 's development at the time " life-sustaining . " " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe , " köhler said .
" the alliance partners , and especially the united states , gave us germans the calming certainty that friendly nations wholeheartedly stood for peace and freedom in our country . " defending nato 's ideals after german reunification in 1990 , the former east germany also became a part of nato .
in 1995 , the german military participated in a nato-led foreign operation for the first time - in the former yugoslavia .
today , around 5,000 german soldiers are serving under the nato flag , mainly in afghanistan and kosovo . " politically , germany had come a very long way before it decided to take part in a nato peacekeeping operation outside of german territory , " said köhler .
" in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany now makes up the largest contingent of soldiers and staff , and is making an invaluable contribution . " germany is the biggest contributor of troops for foreign missions and , after the us , the second biggest financial contributor to nato .
but only once has a german been nato 's general secretary , when manfred wörner served from 1988 to 1994 . split over iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cracks have been paved over , but the iraq war caused a bitter division between us president george w. bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder until the conflict over the iraq war , germany was known in nato for being a loyal ally of the us .
that once harmonious relationship now bears deep scars .
at the last nato summit in february , german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded more say for the europeans in nato 's decisions . " i have the impression that nato and the other european institutions are very interested in improving the transatlantic dialogue , also when it comes to a pending decision " schröder said .
" we can only defend together what we have also decided together . " fifty years after the former west germany 's entry in nato , the organization 's role has changed dramatically .
the main focus is no longer on deterring enemies threatening to start a nuclear war .
rather , nato 's priority is defending common values and security interests all over the world .
its forces have been transformed into flexible units capable of responding quickly to a crisis . for the german army , this has meant a seemingly endless restructuring marathon .
but germany has every reason to stick by the alliance , according to a german general at the brussels headquarters , as germany 's membership in nato signified its return to the civilized world . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

and for nato , which was founded in 1949 , the move was equally important .
the former west germany was a key area of concentration along the iron curtain which divided europe into its eastern and western blocs , and it was strategically important that west germany be integrated in the west both politically and militarily . by the time west germany joined the north atlantic treaty organization on may 6 , 1955 , france had gradually let go of its original concerns about entrusting an armed forces to germany - it was , after all , just 10 years since the brutal end of world war ii .
but 50 years ago , west germany had no army to speak of - this was slowly built up over the ensuing years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : divided germany : a poster for the warsaw pact only eight days later , on may 14 , 1955 , east germany became a founding member of the warsaw pact , the soviet-led military alliance .
on a visit to nato headquarters in brussels earlier this year , german president horst köhler called nato 's development at the time " life-sustaining . " " for germany , nato was a guarantee for peace in europe , " köhler said .
" the alliance partners , and especially the united states , gave us germans the calming certainty that friendly nations wholeheartedly stood for peace and freedom in our country . " defending nato 's ideals after german reunification in 1990 , the former east germany also became a part of nato .
in 1995 , the german military participated in a nato-led foreign operation for the first time - in the former yugoslavia .
today , around 5,000 german soldiers are serving under the nato flag , mainly in afghanistan and kosovo . " politically , germany had come a very long way before it decided to take part in a nato peacekeeping operation outside of german territory , " said köhler .
" in the balkans and in afghanistan , germany now makes up the largest contingent of soldiers and staff , and is making an invaluable contribution . " germany is the biggest contributor of troops for foreign missions and , after the us , the second biggest financial contributor to nato .

at the last nato summit in february , german chancellor gerhard schröder demanded more say for the europeans in nato 's decisions . " i have the impression that nato and the other european institutions are very interested in improving the transatlantic dialogue , also when it comes to a pending decision " schröder said .
" we can only defend together what we have also decided together . " fifty years after the former west germany 's entry in nato , the organization 's role has changed dramatically .
the main focus is no longer on deterring enemies threatening to start a nuclear war .
rather , nato 's priority is defending common values and security interests all over the world .
its forces have been transformed into flexible units capable of responding quickly to a crisis . for the german army , this has meant a seemingly endless restructuring marathon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2005 blair wins historic third term großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh mandate for labor - with reduced support prime minister tony blair said friday his labor party had won a new mandate to govern britain but must " respond wisely " to voters who gave it another term in power with a reduced majority . " we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback .

" we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .

" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback .

proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .

" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback .

but iraq returned to haunt him , especially when he was forced mid-way through the campaign to publish a secret memo from his attorney general that questioned the legality of invading iraq to overthrow saddam hussein . howard branded blair a " liar , " a rare accusation for one british politician to make to another , while liberal democrats chief charles kennedy had hoped to cash in on his party 's anti-war stance . with the election out of the way , blair will be turning his attention to the international stage , as britain takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 and hosts a group of eight summit in scotland on july 6-8 . but he faces yet another daunting challenge , as he has pledged to put the eu constitution , the subject of a closely-fought referendum in france on may 29 , before the famously euroskeptic british public next year . longer term , the outcome of the election raises questions as to whether blair will be able to make good on his desire , announced last year , to serve a full term if re-elected , and then resign .

the countries ' leaders said in a joint interview that germany was responsible for the war , adding that it also suffered greatly . " even if our generation is not in itself guilty -lrb- for wwii -rrb- we bear the responsibility for all our history , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in the joint interview with russian president vladimir putin , which appeared in the german daily bild on friday . " germany caused and started one of the worst wars in the history of humanity , " he said .
schröder said germans had suffered during and after the war , the end of which meant " the misery of refugees and a new lack of freedom " in the country . putin acknowledged german suffering too .
" of course german civilians suffered but this was neither the soviet union 's nor the red army 's fault .
they did n't start the war , " he said .
" the german people were in many ways victims of a lack of responsibility on behalf of their politicians at that time .
they were poisoned by the ideology of national socialism and led into carnage , " said putin .
" for millions of ordinary germans this military adventure became a personal tragedy . " putin used the bombing of dresden , which was carried out by british and american air forces and led to an estimated civilian death toll of 35,000 , to illustrate his point .
" even today i ca n't begin to comprehend just why dresden was destroyed .
if you look at it in terms of military strategy there was no need for it at the time , " said putin .

" if you consider the horror of the war , the reconciliation between germany and russia is a miracle , " said schröder . " both our peoples , russian and german , have gone through a great deal of drama in their histories .
i believe those experiences have made us all the wiser , " said putin , who concluded that " the historic reconciliation between russians and germans has been achieved . " on sunday , a formal liberation day ceremony commemorating the victory over nazi germany on may 8 , 1945 will take place in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2005 homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans are believers in the effects of the little white pills while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science . homeopathy is one of the most popular complementary therapies , with about 100,000 physicians practising it globally .
in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .
that would help guarantee access to a variety of therapies in the national health system , steuernagel said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .
that would help guarantee access to a variety of therapies in the national health system , steuernagel said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health service sick , doctors say german doctors have voiced concern about the health of their own profession during a four-day national congress in berlin , responding to widespread protests over low pay and untenable working conditions .

" it must be better " than the other world cups , said former anti-apartheid activist and lawmaker danny jordaan , the head of south africa ’ s organizing committee .
" it must be african and world class . "
the 2010 world cup will mark the first time that world 's most-watched tournament will be held on african soil and the biggest international event ever staged in south africa .
jordaan told afp that fifa president sepp blatter had informed his team during a visit in january that the 2010 world cup stood a chance of being more financially successful than the 2006 event in germany .
the 2010 world cup promises to be more than just a sports event , said jordaan , pointing to the 1998 tournament in france as a trendsetter in that approach .
" we would like to place it in a broader context as france did , " said jordaan .

the 2010 world cup promises to be more than just a sports event , said jordaan , pointing to the 1998 tournament in france as a trendsetter in that approach .

at a meeting of 30 wto member states in paris , trade ministers agreed to a tariff structure for agricultural produce , paving the way for export subsidies to be cut .
developing countries argue that their agricultural products can not compete on the global market against heavily subsidised produce from the european union and the united states . excess produce is often dumped on poorer nations further pushing down prices and they are demanding greater access to the markets of richer nations through a reduction in import tariffs .
under the agreement , agricultural tariffs can be converted into a percentage sum rather than being calculated by a flat rate of dollars or euros per tonne .
global trade talks in cancun , two years ago , collapsed over disagreement over tariffs and farming subsidies , and trade ministers hope this deal will pave the way for talks in hong kong later this year .

according to some estimates , cheap clothing from china to europe has surged by 500 percent the thirty year-old quota system , which expired this year , set limits on the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country .
eu trade commissioner , peter mandelson said the inquiry should take at most 60 days and could result in the introduction of possible safeguard measures .
the move comes after the eu warned china to reduce its clothing exports to europe or face enforced limits .
the united states has also launched a similar investigation .
however the director-general of the world trade organisation , supachai panitchpakdi said nations should wait at least a year before taking any protectionist steps .

" we have reports from over 30 countries so far in the first 13 or 14 hours since the spread of the virus on monday , " mikko hyppoenen , head of anti-virus research at finnish firm f-secure , told afp . internet security firm trend micro placed sober.s in its ' red alert ' category , saying that " using social engineering techniques , it sends out an e-mail supposedly sent by the soccer organization fifa , " offering tickets to the 2006 tournament in germany .

" worm suspected of coming from germany world cup organizers have warned fans that the virus will appear as a ticketing confirmation message from the addresses ticket @ fifa.de and gewinn @ fifa.de and that attachments should not be opened . the worm spreads through e-mail attachments as a " .zip " file .
the messages are written in english or german , and the creator of the worm is believed to come from a german-speaking country , hyppoenen said . he said there were no estimates for how many computers had been infected so far , and warned users to exercise caution in opening e-mail attachments since the infected e-mails will appear to come from a person they know . most anti-virus systems have already been updated to protect users , hyppoenen said .

" most anti-virus systems had time to update " before users switched on their computers on tuesday morning , hyppoenen said .
but because of the time difference to the americas , the united states and south america were harder hit .
hyppoenen added that experts had not yet determined the virus-writer 's motive . worm provides way in for hacker " the worm will install a back door so the virus writer can gain access to the infected computer .
we do n't know yet what his motive is .
it could be to attack websites or to send spam , " he said . the first phase of world cup ticket sales was over-subscribed by 10 times and those fans who were successful in the lottery have already been informed .

the e-mail worm is part of a bigger virus , also known as sober.p , which has spread to more than 30 countries since monday , affecting mainly the united states and south america . " we have reports from over 30 countries so far in the first 13 or 14 hours since the spread of the virus on monday , " mikko hyppoenen , head of anti-virus research at finnish firm f-secure , told afp . internet security firm trend micro placed sober.s in its ' red alert ' category , saying that " using social engineering techniques , it sends out an e-mail supposedly sent by the soccer organization fifa , " offering tickets to the 2006 tournament in germany .
the e-mail includes correct contact information for a fifa official .
us firm mcafee classified the worm as a " medium risk . " worm suspected of coming from germany world cup organizers have warned fans that the virus will appear as a ticketing confirmation message from the addresses ticket @ fifa.de and gewinn @ fifa.de and that attachments should not be opened . the worm spreads through e-mail attachments as a " .zip " file .
the messages are written in english or german , and the creator of the worm is believed to come from a german-speaking country , hyppoenen said . he said there were no estimates for how many computers had been infected so far , and warned users to exercise caution in opening e-mail attachments since the infected e-mails will appear to come from a person they know . most anti-virus systems have already been updated to protect users , hyppoenen said .

divine intervention ?
no : ebay . in january , benjamin halbe paid a used car salesman 9,500 euros -lrb- $ 12 , 204 -rrb- for a 1999 volkswagen golf and hit the jackpot .
but the 21-year-old from olpe , in western germany , did n't know that until a few months later when , after checking the previous owner 's records , he found that a cardinal joseph ratzinger had owned the car .
shortly thereafter , ratzinger changed his name to pope benedict xvi , succeeding the late pope john paul ii , and sending halbe on his way to some serious cash .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proof : a bill of sale to cardinal ratzinger on may 5 , the day of the acension , halbe 's silver-gray golf sold for 188,938.88 euros on ebay .
the winning bidder was an american online casino , which contacted halbe minutes later to ask about his bank details .
" i am more than happy that i was able to sell it for such a sum , " said halbe , surrounded by friends , some of whom helped him come up with the plan to auction off the volkswagen .
more cash passed up of course , it could have gone for much more .
had ebay not experienced a server crash 40 minutes before the final bell sounded , the price would have likely continued upward .
" i feel completely deceived , " said helmut drossman , an ad agency chief from bavaria who was unable to bid on the car in the final minutes .
" i 'm frustrated , because we could have offered significantly more than the final price , " said thorsten senneke , who bid for a group of investors , according to the news agency dpa .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi was most likely chauffered around in the car but a re-sale price of almost 10 times what he paid for is not half-bad either .
halbe , who earns a little bit of money doing his required civil service duty , plans to spend his hard-earned money on a new car , maybe a vacation " and put the rest in a bank . "
as for the online casino that won the bid , it will have to be careful not to promise too much in advertising the former pope mobile .

in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .
" they need a whole system of support .
but we give them something that matches their state .
if they had tremendous weakness or trembling , we would give them a remedy which also has those symptoms and it would help their body to cure that weakness so that they would have the courage to withhold from the drugs . " german homeopaths are advocating that the study of homeopathy be included in the curriculum of the country 's medical schools , for improved research conditions , and for the establishment of a national institute for complementary medicine .

in germany , the birthplace of homeopathy , about 6,000 physicians specialize in the therapy , which is based on the law of similars - fighting disease with drugs that provoke similar symptoms . around 20 percent of germans reportedly swear by homeopathic medication .
however , this alternative form of medicine is still awaiting official recognition in germany . homeopathic treatment is covered by private insurers , but not by the statutory health system .
at the 60th world homeopathy congress in berlin , which wraps up on saturday , the chairman of the german association of homeopathic doctors , karl-wilhelm steuernagel , criticized the current situation .
he argued it was unfair , particularly as homeopathic remedies are often far cheaper than conventional remedies . german practitioners have long been seeking wider recognition for homeopathy and have filed a suit with the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
but experts doubt the case will be decided anytime soon , as unambiguous scientific proof of the efficacy of homeopathy has yet to be delivered . inspired by malaria bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathy 's founder , samuel hahnemann the emergence of homeopathy as a medical discipline is attributed to samuel hahnemann , a doctor born 250 years ago in meissen , germany .
in 1796 , hahnemann proposed a new set of healing principles as an alternative to the conventional medicine of his day . he developed his theories on homeopathy after realizing that taking quinine to treat malaria produced the same symptoms as the illness itself .
hahnemann also began experimenting in diluting substances , including poisonous metallic elements such as mercury and arsenic , to derive their benefits while avoiding their side-effects . it 's partly the fact that the substances prescribed to patients in homeopathy are diluted to such an extent that they ’ re no longer traceable that has caused many conventional doctors to regard it with scepticism .
many credit homeopathy with a placebo effect at best . but visiting doctors participating in the four-day berlin congress said if this were true , homeopathy would not have survived on such a scale for over 200 years . fighting chronic illness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeopathic treatment is often sought when conventional allopathic medicine seems to be at a loss - particularly when it comes to treating chronic diseases . " it 's possible to bring about a cure in chronic illnesses where allopathic medicine can not , " said greek physician george vithoulkas , a conference participant .
" we never claimed we can cure everything but we can help in many cases , especially chronic cases where allopathy has no answer . " other areas where homeopathy has gained a foothold include the treatment of psychological traumas and drug addiction , where it forms part of a holistic recovery strategy , said nancy herrick , a prominent homeopathic educator from the united states . " i would never attempt to treat a drug patient only with homeopathy , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.05.2005 blair wins historic third term großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh mandate for labor - with reduced support prime minister tony blair said friday his labor party had won a new mandate to govern britain but must " respond wisely " to voters who gave it another term in power with a reduced majority . " we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback . " we have landed a good hard punch on mr blair 's nose , " said alex deane , chief of staff for tim collins , education spokesman for the conservative party . iraq war lost labout votes foreign secretary jack straw admitted on bbc television : " i do n't think there 's any doubt that iraq played a part in the reduction in votes -lrb- for labor -rrb- . " blair was keen to fight the election on labor 's stewardship of the robust british economy and the need to press on with much-needed health and education reforms .
but iraq returned to haunt him , especially when he was forced mid-way through the campaign to publish a secret memo from his attorney general that questioned the legality of invading iraq to overthrow saddam hussein . howard branded blair a " liar , " a rare accusation for one british politician to make to another , while liberal democrats chief charles kennedy had hoped to cash in on his party 's anti-war stance . with the election out of the way , blair will be turning his attention to the international stage , as britain takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 and hosts a group of eight summit in scotland on july 6-8 . but he faces yet another daunting challenge , as he has pledged to put the eu constitution , the subject of a closely-fought referendum in france on may 29 , before the famously euroskeptic british public next year . longer term , the outcome of the election raises questions as to whether blair will be able to make good on his desire , announced last year , to serve a full term if re-elected , and then resign .
" this is not good for labor .
this means blair goes quickly , " probably two years into his maximum five-year term , professor richard sennett of the london school of economics -lrb- lse -rrb- told afp . patrick dunleavy , another lse professor , added : " it perhaps suggests that people are happy with a labor government , but unhappy with tony blair because of the iraq war . " shortly after polling stations opened thursday , two grenades - described by police as " novelty-type grenades filled with black powder " - went off outside the british consulate in new york city . no one was injured , but the incident on the other side of the atlantic prompted british police , themselves already on heightened terrorist alert , to bolster their presence in london and elsewhere . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swapping the third way for a third term ?
the third way was billed as the way forward for europe ’ s center-left .

" we have got to listen to the people and respond wisely and sensibly but they have made it very clear - they wanted to carry on with labor , " blair told party workers .
" we have got a mandate to govern this country again , " blair said . as results came in from thursday 's vote , blair 's labour party passed the required 324 seats to gain an absolute majority in the house of commons , meaning it could govern without the support of other parties .
proud that the party had won a third term , blair said : " let 's go out and make the most of it . " german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday was one of the first world leaders to congratulate blair on the victory of his labor party in the general election , noting that the results also fell on blair 's birthday .
" i think that with this electoral victory , you 've given yourself the best birthday present possible , " said schröder in a brief message to blair . the outcome of thursday 's general election called into question blair 's stated intention to serve a full term before handing over the reins of power , most probably to his ambitious finance minister , gordon brown . with ballots counted in 619 constituencies , labor had won 353 seats in the 646-seat house of commons , ahead of michael howard 's conservatives with 195 seats and the liberal democrats with 59 seats .
independents and scottish and welsh nationalists took the other seats . a bbc-itv exit poll forecast an eventual 66-seat majority , well down from labor 's huge 167-seat majority in the last elections of june 2001 .
sky news television projected an 80-seat majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and his wife , cherie , with sons euan -lrb- l -rrb- and nicky -lrb- r -rrb- outside a polling station in trimdon , in the prime minister 's sedgefield constituency , to cast their vote in the general election on may 5 .
" to be re-elected for a third time is very special , so it 's a tremendous privilege and an honor , " blair told a hall full of cheering supporters in his home district of sedgefield , northeast england .
" let 's make sure we use it for the good of our country and the people . " weakened position but he conceded that his position has been weakened . " it is clear that the british people wanted the return of the labor party , but with a reduced majority , " he said .
" we have to respond to that sensibly , wisely and responsibly . " michael howard , cheered by his tories ' strongest performance at the polls since blair and labor broke their 18-year run in power in may 1997 , conceded defeat , but with a warning to the prime minister .
" i congratulate him -lrb- but -rrb- i believe that the time has now come for him to deliver on the things that really matter for the people of our country , " he told his party faithful . final results were not due in before late friday , when blair - us president george w. bush 's staunchest ally on the world stage - will have already started putting together a new cabinet . but his opponents wasted no time in savoring his setback . " we have landed a good hard punch on mr blair 's nose , " said alex deane , chief of staff for tim collins , education spokesman for the conservative party . iraq war lost labout votes foreign secretary jack straw admitted on bbc television : " i do n't think there 's any doubt that iraq played a part in the reduction in votes -lrb- for labor -rrb- . " blair was keen to fight the election on labor 's stewardship of the robust british economy and the need to press on with much-needed health and education reforms .
but iraq returned to haunt him , especially when he was forced mid-way through the campaign to publish a secret memo from his attorney general that questioned the legality of invading iraq to overthrow saddam hussein . howard branded blair a " liar , " a rare accusation for one british politician to make to another , while liberal democrats chief charles kennedy had hoped to cash in on his party 's anti-war stance . with the election out of the way , blair will be turning his attention to the international stage , as britain takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 and hosts a group of eight summit in scotland on july 6-8 . but he faces yet another daunting challenge , as he has pledged to put the eu constitution , the subject of a closely-fought referendum in france on may 29 , before the famously euroskeptic british public next year . longer term , the outcome of the election raises questions as to whether blair will be able to make good on his desire , announced last year , to serve a full term if re-elected , and then resign .

instead , its legacy is thousands of destroyed lives , broken families and stories of personal shame . " there are still a lot of myths around the lebensborn program , that for example , they were breeding centers for the ss , " said dorothee schmitz-köster , who wrote a book on the program called " german mother , are you prepared ? "
" there is almost a pornographic aspect to it in many people 's minds , which meant for decades it simply was n't talked about . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german mother , are you prepared ... " is the title of the book on lebensborn centers not stud farms despite the stubborn belief that the lebensborn program was about bringing blond-haired ss officers together with rosy-cheeked german girls for the sake of baby-making , the real story is somewhat less titillating . since the beginning of the 20th century , the birth rate in germany had been falling and ss chief heinrich himmler -lrb- photo -rrb- wanted to reverse the trend , especially as he must have known germany was soon to have more territory that would need to be populated by those the nazis deemed genetically acceptable - healthy , white , non-jewish , preferably nordic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler in 1935 , he formed the lebensborn association and two years later opened the first maternity home in bavaria , in steinhöring outside of munich .
it was a place that offered an attractive alternative to a home or hospital birth to many women , especially single ones . at that time , being an unwed mother carried an enormous social stigma and could even result in a woman being fired from some jobs , not to mention ostracized from her family .
the lebensborn homes offered unwed mothers a place to go have their baby in secret , in pleasant surroundings , with top-notch pre-natal care . " we were treated like princesses , " reminisced one woman in an interview who brought her baby into the world at one of the homes . " i continue to find it fascinating how intelligently the nazis enacted their policies , " schmitz-köster said .
" they entered into this moral hornet 's nest , the issue of unwed mothers , and made women a very attractive offer that fit perfectly with their own social goals . " with the lebensborn homes , himmler could ensure that these women did not abort their babies and therefore could keep the country 's birth rate up .
at the same time it allowed him to pursue his goal of creating a future nation of " racially pure " people . genetic criteria of course , not every woman was accepted into the homes .
a woman did not have to show a marriage certificate , but she and the father did have to provide documentation that they were " aryan " and healthy .
in fact , the proof of racial suitability had to extend back to both parents ' grandparents . those with jewish kin , a disability or genetic disease , or a connection with any of the other " undesirable " groups would find the lebensborn doors slammed in their faces .
and although most babies who were born in the homes received high-quality care , those children born disabled were sometimes dispatched to euthanasia clinics where they were poisoned or starved to death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a walk with the children at a lebensborn home while many of the women in the homes were unwed mothers , who were granted anonymity and whose births were not recorded on official registered , wives of higher-ranking party members also often chose the lebensborn program to carry out their pregnancies . it 's not clear exactly how many children were born in the homes , since official records were kept only in special lebensborn registers , many of which of burned in the closing days of the war .
schmitz-köster estimates around 6,000 babies were delivered in the 10 homes in germany and the other scattered throughout occupied europe .
others put that number between 7,000 and 8,000 . continue reading to find out more about one european country occupied by the nazis where the program was pursued especially enthusiastically . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

the norwegians came closest to the nazis ' aryan ideal - namely blond and blue-eyed .
himmler was eager to encourage the production of babies of mixed german and norwegian parentage . because nazi germany saw norway as a country filled with " blood brothers and sisters , " the occupation of the country was generally much less harsh than in other places .
at the time , norway had a population of three million and there were some 400,000 german soldiers stationed there .
a good deal of mixing took place and the lebensborn homes were very willing to pick up where the german soldier left off . but while the occupation might have been relatively easy , for norwegian mothers and those children of german soldiers born there , many in lebensborn homes , the post-war period was a nightmare . " german whore " gerd fleischer is the treasurer of the " lebensborn league of norwegian war children , " an organization which offers support for its members and seeks compensation from the norwegian government for its dealings with children born of german fathers during the occupation . her mother fell in love with a german soldier in 1941 and gerd was born one year later .
although her father left the country with the retreating german forces , her life was relatively happy until the age of seven , when she started school .
it was then that she learned about the intense hatred in norwegian society toward germans and anything to do with them , including their children . " the first time i was called ' german whore ' at school , i did n't know what it meant , " she said .
" my mother talked to me about my father , but other mothers did n't want to admit to anything .
we were their shame . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul hansen one member of her group , paul hansen -lrb- photo -rrb- , spent the first three years of his life in a lebensborn home after his mother abandoned him .
but because of his german parentage , he was sent to a collection center for unclaimed lebensborn children .
later , norway 's ministry of social affairs had him classified as retarded and sent him to a mental institution where he was beaten by guards and had to listen to psychotic screams of fellow patients .
he did n't leave there until he was 22 . what has made life bearable for many of these lebensborn children who still have difficulties in their personal and professional lives is their willingness to find one another and come forward with their stories .
they have called on the norwegian government to provide compensation for its discriminatory handling of them after the war .
the government has not met all their demands , but has offered a small amount of compensation . slow acknowledgment in germany , the story is different .
until just recently , there was no organization of former lebensborn children .
only recently have there been tentative movements by a few to set up an organization similar to the two now existing in norway .
because of the destruction of the lebensborn files at the war 's conclusion , many people do not know who their fathers are .
many of their mothers , if they are still alive , are still reluctant to talk about that time in their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the 2000 film " spring of life " " a lot of that is bound up with the feeling of being a perpetrator somehow , " schmitz-köster said .
" many of the children in germany had fathers who were in the ss and were war criminals .
that 's completely different than the situation in norway , for example , where most are children of simple german soldiers .
here there are still strong feelings of guilt . " but she said after having written her book , she received many calls from people wanting to know more , and who were interested in researching their own pasts .
according to her , there is still a lot about the lebensborn era that is shrouded in secrecy and shame , and is just now coming to light . " there is still a great need among many of these children to know more about their history , " she said . kyle james , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

instead , its legacy is thousands of destroyed lives , broken families and stories of personal shame . " there are still a lot of myths around the lebensborn program , that for example , they were breeding centers for the ss , " said dorothee schmitz-köster , who wrote a book on the program called " german mother , are you prepared ? "
" there is almost a pornographic aspect to it in many people 's minds , which meant for decades it simply was n't talked about . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " german mother , are you prepared ... " is the title of the book on lebensborn centers not stud farms despite the stubborn belief that the lebensborn program was about bringing blond-haired ss officers together with rosy-cheeked german girls for the sake of baby-making , the real story is somewhat less titillating . since the beginning of the 20th century , the birth rate in germany had been falling and ss chief heinrich himmler -lrb- photo -rrb- wanted to reverse the trend , especially as he must have known germany was soon to have more territory that would need to be populated by those the nazis deemed genetically acceptable - healthy , white , non-jewish , preferably nordic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich himmler in 1935 , he formed the lebensborn association and two years later opened the first maternity home in bavaria , in steinhöring outside of munich .
it was a place that offered an attractive alternative to a home or hospital birth to many women , especially single ones . at that time , being an unwed mother carried an enormous social stigma and could even result in a woman being fired from some jobs , not to mention ostracized from her family .
the lebensborn homes offered unwed mothers a place to go have their baby in secret , in pleasant surroundings , with top-notch pre-natal care . " we were treated like princesses , " reminisced one woman in an interview who brought her baby into the world at one of the homes . " i continue to find it fascinating how intelligently the nazis enacted their policies , " schmitz-köster said .
" they entered into this moral hornet 's nest , the issue of unwed mothers , and made women a very attractive offer that fit perfectly with their own social goals . " with the lebensborn homes , himmler could ensure that these women did not abort their babies and therefore could keep the country 's birth rate up .
at the same time it allowed him to pursue his goal of creating a future nation of " racially pure " people . genetic criteria of course , not every woman was accepted into the homes .
a woman did not have to show a marriage certificate , but she and the father did have to provide documentation that they were " aryan " and healthy .
in fact , the proof of racial suitability had to extend back to both parents ' grandparents . those with jewish kin , a disability or genetic disease , or a connection with any of the other " undesirable " groups would find the lebensborn doors slammed in their faces .
and although most babies who were born in the homes received high-quality care , those children born disabled were sometimes dispatched to euthanasia clinics where they were poisoned or starved to death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a walk with the children at a lebensborn home while many of the women in the homes were unwed mothers , who were granted anonymity and whose births were not recorded on official registered , wives of higher-ranking party members also often chose the lebensborn program to carry out their pregnancies . it 's not clear exactly how many children were born in the homes , since official records were kept only in special lebensborn registers , many of which of burned in the closing days of the war .
schmitz-köster estimates around 6,000 babies were delivered in the 10 homes in germany and the other scattered throughout occupied europe .
others put that number between 7,000 and 8,000 . continue reading to find out more about one european country occupied by the nazis where the program was pursued especially enthusiastically . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : accused nazi child killer goes free austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial .

by guto harri political correspondent posted : friday 6 may , 0440bst one campaign promise has already been kept .
as i reported here nearly a month ago , tory campaign worker tara hamilton-miller promised to wear a different pair of shoes for each day during the campaign .
she has achieved her goal , keeping her word tonight by sporting a pair of golden kitten heels and a fabulous grecian dress .
your comments top weblog entries now this is an entry from our campaign weblog yet another example of tory frivolous self-interest .
as a student , there 's no way i could afford thirty-odd pairs of shoes , nor could the majority of people i know .
if that 's what the tories spend their money on , perhaps they 're being paid too much .
christine , oxford / dublin congratulations to tara !
just highlights some of the brilliant creativity and originality that has gone into an excellent conservative campaign .
the tories emphasise that they stand for freedom of the individual over the state 's powers - i ca n't think of a better way to illustrate this in a lighthearted way !
it 's surely only a matter of time before blair 's over-zealous nanny state regulates what type of shoes we 're allowed to wear .
and how can anyone seriously take offence at a personal decision on what she wears to work each day ?
charles , london perhaps tara can give ruth kelly some hints .
if i see her wearing that baggy brown trouser suit just one more time !
helen , leeds maybe she had a message for tony blair , borrowed from nancy sinatra , if you remember the lyrics : " these boots were made for walkin ' by nancy sinatra album : boots -lrb- 1995 -rrb- , you go-go girl you keep saying you 've got something for me. something you call love , but confess .
you 've been a messin ' where you should n't have been a messin ' and now someone else is gettin ' all your best .
these boots are made for walking , and that 's just what they 'll do one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you . "
lloyd , manchester , england what a wonderful way to get the female vote , i dip my hat to her .

" were you up for portillo " became a much heard cry after the poll .
well it was a very different face mr twigg , now familiar as a schools minister , was wearing when the tories came to reposess their seat in enfield southgate on election night 2005 .
but another iconic moment - this time summing up what seemed to be happening to labour across the country .
that is , to coin michael howard 's phrase , the smiles were being wiped off their faces .
your comments twiggs 's defeat sums it up .
he was a great mp and i voted for him both times in 1997 and 2001 .
but if you vote for stephen , you 're automatically voting for blair , and i just could n't do it .
sorry stephen , but it 's blair 's fault you were n't re-elected .
john tracey , winchmore hill , enfield i think stephen twigg is one of the most committed and responsible mp 's in this country 's history and i am sad to see him being replaced , not least because he provided one of the funniest election night moments ever when he beat portillo in ' 97 .
i hope he comes back stronger and i wish him well. jo , ware i am truly sorry for stephen twigg who is a fantastic chap and has been hard working for the local community for which he represented .
unfortunately , it was not a personal thing that the voters did when they voted conservative , they were voting for the party and not the man .
it 's a real shame but this is what happens when you have a situation where local issues are overwhelmed with the nations issues eg a general election .
i wish him all the best and good fortunes to stephen twigg in the future , he has the potential to become a future prime minister !
ben soydan , southgate / enfield sad for steven perhaps , but hardly iconic .
this seems to show two things .
one , a lot of people regard iraq as important and are prepared to change their voting patterns because of it .
two , most people still do not want the conservatives in power .
i do n't think that very much more can actually be drawn from last night 's results .
after all , there is -lrb- practically speaking -rrb- very little " blue water " between either of the two main parties any more .
rob miles , barnet , herts i 'm glad mr twigg has finally been removed as mp for enfield southgate .
from my own personal experience of him -lrb- after speaking and writing to him -rrb- , i found him to be just another spineless career politician who touts the party line without standing up for his constituents ' grievances !
jn , southgate , london the smiles certainly wo n't be " wiped off their faces " .
the reduced majority of the labour victory should n't worry blair .
with the civil contingencies act now in place he can declare a totalitarian state any time he chooses .
it 's 1933 all over again ...
tyler , london i agree with matt .
i live in enfield southgate and this a truly terrible result .
stephen twigg was a fantastic mp who worked hard for local people .
voters became too side tracked with the blair credibility problem and fell for a set of false promises from a single issue party .
i wish mr twigg well in whatever he decides to do and hope he remains in public life .
pity he 'll probably never be my mp again though .
michelle , london this is a terrible result for enfield and a result of labour supporters protesting with a lib dem vote .
unfortunately it has resulted in the loss of one of the most hard-working and ambitious mps who has done a lot for enfield .
i am regretting my own vote as i know are others .
i hope mr twigg is around in four years when the iraq issue will not impair judgement .

unfortunately it has resulted in the loss of one of the most hard-working and ambitious mps who has done a lot for enfield .
i am regretting my own vote as i know are others .
i hope mr twigg is around in four years when the iraq issue will not impair judgement .

chancellor gordon brown -lrb- labour - kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath -rrb- " our purpose will be to maintain and entrench our economic stability and prosperity , to advance towards full employment in this country , and to build a stronger , fairer britain where every child has the best start in life and there is dignity , security and opportunity for every family in the country . "
scottish national party leader alex salmond " the snp has made real progress in this election .
we now have ' scotland 's super six ' representing scotland at westminster , a team which has taken seats from the labour party in scotland at a general election for the first time since 1974 .
we can now look forward with confidence to the prospect of an snp victory in 2007 when both labour and the liberal democrats will be saddled with all the misdeeds of their failed coalition . "
sir menzies campbell -lrb- liberal democrats -rrb- " it would be surprising if there had not been , in the country , a widespread determination to reflect back to labour the concern that people feel about iraq and the issues of trust and credibility which have been fundamental in assessing the performance of the government and of course important in assessing the performance of the prime minister himself . "
robin cook -lrb- labour - livingston -rrb- " many of those who voted for us today did so with anxieties about what happened over the war in iraq and their anxieties must be followed by questions in parliament when it returns . "
jo swinson -lrb- liberal democrats - east dunbartonshire -rrb- " there was clearly an anti-labour vote but i also think that the positive lib dem campaign went down well .
charles kennedy did extremely well and our message certainly resonated . "
defeated conservative candidate peter duncan " we are too significant a force to be at the margins of scottish politics .
we need to be in the centre ground and in the long-term running scotland 's government . "
defeated anti-war candidate rose gentle " this is not the end , this is just the beginning .
blair thinks the war is going to go away but the next step is we 're going to take him to court over iraq . "
scottish conservative deputy leader annabel goldie " it is very obvious to me that in all constituencies , people have been looking at how to give tony blair a bloody nose and they have made their judgement about which party is the best bet to achieve that . "
labour 's calum macdonald after losing the western isles seat to the snp " i feel it was a protest vote against the large-scale wind farm proposed by amec for north lewis .
i think that was a factor in my defeat . "
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy " the era of three-party politics right across the uk is now with us . "
scottish secretary alistair darling - labour mp for edinburgh south west " the election here in this constituency was a reflection of the election across the country where i believe the people share our view of a fair and just society , and they have totally rejected the conservative alternative . "
scottish socialist party convener colin fox " we expected a tough time , we got a tough time , we have thrown our hands up to it and said we knew it was coming . "
mohammed sarwar - labour mp for glasgow central " i think it would be wrong for us to share a platform with the bnp .
i am glad that people in glasgow central have rejected the bnp and their facist views . "
robin harper - scottish green party co-convener " i 'm terribly pleased with our performance - it 's better than we have ever done before .
if this election had been a representative one , we would probably be looking at two scottish green mps elected . "

mr kilroy-silk said he had never really expected to win the seat , but wanted to offer the public " some honesty " in politics .
" i 've been saying no - the signs say we ca n't win and we never really expected to , but what we wanted was to put down a mark and to actually give people the opportunity .
" i do n't think i could ever have actually felt comfortable with myself in the future had i not stood here today and known what the british people want . "
his party , which fielded 65 candidates countrywide , promised to introduce a flat tax rate of 22 % , to withdraw britain from the european union and to clamp down on the number of refugees entering the country .

the only sitting tory mp and commons counterpart mr brown were thrust together in this contest following boundary changes .
mr duncan polled 18,022 votes but mr brown was almost 3,000 votes ahead on 20,924 - a notional labour hold .
it was a major setback in the tories ' continued revival bid in scotland .
the tories were well aware that the new seat had a theoretical labour majority of 141 .
mr duncan took the seat of galloway and upper nithsdale from the scottish national party in 2001 , with the lowest conservative majority in the commons .
mr brown has been mp for dumfries since 1997 .
he stepped down as a parliamentary aide to the leader of the house of lords in 2003 in protest at the iraq war . "
clearly it 's a personal disappointment but i think we have shown that in the south of scotland we can still win constituencies " peter duncan scottish tories mr duncan , who was elected scottish tory chairman last year , had been at the forefront of their campaign and was a high-profile loss , compensated by party colleague david mundell 's success in dumfriesshire , clydesdale and tweeddale .
contemplating his defeat , mr duncan consoled himself with the thought that a colleague had kept the scottish tory flag flying at westminster .
he told bbc scotland : " clearly it 's a personal disappointment but i think we have shown that in the south of scotland we can still win constituencies .
" we have a longer term ambition to build on that and make the solution to scotland 's problems - building problems under labour - the scottish conservative solution . "
the tories ' big rivals in the old seat had been the snp but this time round candidate douglas henderson polled 6,182 , 12.1 % of the vote , with keith legg of the lib dems on 4,259 -lrb- 8.3 % -rrb- .
mr duncan said : " there were clearly some very big vote shifts going on tonight .
" i think when you get a new constituency boundary people are looking around for how the first vote comes out to establish where their voting priorities will lie but our task is to build upon the issues that matter and seek to build upon that for the future . "

the only sitting tory mp and commons counterpart mr brown were thrust together in this contest following boundary changes .
mr duncan polled 18,022 votes but mr brown was almost 3,000 votes ahead on 20,924 - a notional labour hold .
it was a major setback in the tories ' continued revival bid in scotland .
the tories were well aware that the new seat had a theoretical labour majority of 141 .
mr duncan took the seat of galloway and upper nithsdale from the scottish national party in 2001 , with the lowest conservative majority in the commons .
mr brown has been mp for dumfries since 1997 .
he stepped down as a parliamentary aide to the leader of the house of lords in 2003 in protest at the iraq war .
clearly it 's a personal disappointment but i think we have shown that in the south of scotland we can still win constituencies peter duncan scottish tories mr duncan , who was elected scottish tory chairman last year , had been at the forefront of their campaign and was a high-profile loss , compensated by party colleague david mundell 's success in dumfriesshire , clydesdale and tweeddale .
contemplating his defeat , mr duncan consoled himself with the thought that a colleague had kept the scottish tory flag flying at westminster .
he told bbc scotland : " clearly it 's a personal disappointment but i think we have shown that in the south of scotland we can still win constituencies .
" we have a longer term ambition to build on that and make the solution to scotland 's problems - building problems under labour - the scottish conservative solution . "
the tories ' big rivals in the old seat had been the snp but this time round candidate douglas henderson polled 6,182 , 12.1 % of the vote , with keith legg of the lib dems on 4,259 -lrb- 8.3 % -rrb- .
mr duncan said : " there were clearly some very big vote shifts going on tonight .
" i think when you get a new constituency boundary people are looking around for how the first vote comes out to establish where their voting priorities will lie but our task is to build upon the issues that matter and seek to build upon that for the future . "

welsh assembly member david davies won monmouth , former am david jones took clwyd west and stephen crabb triumphed in preseli pembrokeshire .
all three conservative gains were at the expense of labour and mr jones had a majority of just 133 .
there were disappointments for the tories elsewhere , as they failed to win vale of glamorgan and cardiff north .
mr davies said he was " absolutely delighted " at the result which gave him a 4,527 majority over huw edwards .
he will now stand down from his role as an am at the next election in cardiff bay in 2007 .
