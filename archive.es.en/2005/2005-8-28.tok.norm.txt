in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .
the new law came into effect on jan.1 , 2005 . " with the new immigration law , we ’ ve cleared the way for germany to welcome new migrants and to rise to the challenges of integration , " said beck . canada as a role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers in hamburg if beck and the governing coalition had their way , the new immigration law would have gone a step further still .
they had hoped , for the first time in german history , to build a legal framework that would allow qualified migrants easy access to immigration . " we wanted to adopt the points system , like they have in canada .
under this system , immigrants would receive a point score according to their personal credentials , which would permit them to enter germany , " beck said . but this section of the act floundered in the mediation committee and in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament .
regulations for self-employed people wanting to settle in germany were also severely tightened . self-employed migrants must invest at least one million euros in germany or commit to creating at least 12 further jobs .
beck ’ s particular bone of contention is that access to the german job market is still very difficult for foreign academics who have studied in germany . germany needs immigration meanwhile , most observers agree germany needs immigration .
but how can the country be sure to prevent an influx of poorly-qualified economic migrants ? " first we need to make it clear once and for all that the recruitment of unqualified labor was national policy in the 50s and 60s , " asserted beck .
" we have accepted this responsibility , and we must make allowances for this , for example with extensive education strategies directed at the children of first- and second-generation immigrants . " migration is the future advocates of liberal immigration policies emphasize that germany will need even more migrants in the future in order to stabilize its social security system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy needs qualified immigrants in order to thrive .
while that may be true in theory , the reality can be quite different , beck said .
many immigrant families come to germany and make claims on the welfare system , and economics experts warn of an unchecked flow of migrants seeking the fruits of the generous german welfare state . but beck argues that many immigrants only make welfare claims because they are excluded from the german job market . " yes , there is immigration into the welfare state , " beck conceded .
" but these migrants tend to be ethnic german immigrants who can ’ t get a foothold in the job market , or jewish immigrants -lrb- whose -rrb- ... very respectable professions are often not respected here .
or they are refugees , to whom we effectively deny access to employment . " beck insisted that more should be done to tackle this issue .

in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .
the new law came into effect on jan.1 , 2005 . " with the new immigration law , we ’ ve cleared the way for germany to welcome new migrants and to rise to the challenges of integration , " said beck . canada as a role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers in hamburg if beck and the governing coalition had their way , the new immigration law would have gone a step further still .
they had hoped , for the first time in german history , to build a legal framework that would allow qualified migrants easy access to immigration . " we wanted to adopt the points system , like they have in canada .
under this system , immigrants would receive a point score according to their personal credentials , which would permit them to enter germany , " beck said . but this section of the act floundered in the mediation committee and in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament .
regulations for self-employed people wanting to settle in germany were also severely tightened . self-employed migrants must invest at least one million euros in germany or commit to creating at least 12 further jobs .
beck ’ s particular bone of contention is that access to the german job market is still very difficult for foreign academics who have studied in germany . germany needs immigration meanwhile , most observers agree germany needs immigration .
but how can the country be sure to prevent an influx of poorly-qualified economic migrants ? " first we need to make it clear once and for all that the recruitment of unqualified labor was national policy in the 50s and 60s , " asserted beck .
" we have accepted this responsibility , and we must make allowances for this , for example with extensive education strategies directed at the children of first- and second-generation immigrants . " migration is the future advocates of liberal immigration policies emphasize that germany will need even more migrants in the future in order to stabilize its social security system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy needs qualified immigrants in order to thrive .
while that may be true in theory , the reality can be quite different , beck said .
many immigrant families come to germany and make claims on the welfare system , and economics experts warn of an unchecked flow of migrants seeking the fruits of the generous german welfare state . but beck argues that many immigrants only make welfare claims because they are excluded from the german job market . " yes , there is immigration into the welfare state , " beck conceded .
" but these migrants tend to be ethnic german immigrants who can ’ t get a foothold in the job market , or jewish immigrants -lrb- whose -rrb- ... very respectable professions are often not respected here .
or they are refugees , to whom we effectively deny access to employment . " beck insisted that more should be done to tackle this issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.08.2005 beck : ' germany is open to immigrants ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she sees germany as ' rising to the challenge ' of immigration marieluise beck has been germany 's commissioner for integration for nearly seven years .
in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .
the new law came into effect on jan.1 , 2005 . " with the new immigration law , we ’ ve cleared the way for germany to welcome new migrants and to rise to the challenges of integration , " said beck . canada as a role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers in hamburg if beck and the governing coalition had their way , the new immigration law would have gone a step further still .
they had hoped , for the first time in german history , to build a legal framework that would allow qualified migrants easy access to immigration . " we wanted to adopt the points system , like they have in canada .
under this system , immigrants would receive a point score according to their personal credentials , which would permit them to enter germany , " beck said . but this section of the act floundered in the mediation committee and in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament .
regulations for self-employed people wanting to settle in germany were also severely tightened . self-employed migrants must invest at least one million euros in germany or commit to creating at least 12 further jobs .
beck ’ s particular bone of contention is that access to the german job market is still very difficult for foreign academics who have studied in germany . germany needs immigration meanwhile , most observers agree germany needs immigration .
but how can the country be sure to prevent an influx of poorly-qualified economic migrants ? " first we need to make it clear once and for all that the recruitment of unqualified labor was national policy in the 50s and 60s , " asserted beck .
" we have accepted this responsibility , and we must make allowances for this , for example with extensive education strategies directed at the children of first- and second-generation immigrants . " migration is the future advocates of liberal immigration policies emphasize that germany will need even more migrants in the future in order to stabilize its social security system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy needs qualified immigrants in order to thrive .
while that may be true in theory , the reality can be quite different , beck said .
many immigrant families come to germany and make claims on the welfare system , and economics experts warn of an unchecked flow of migrants seeking the fruits of the generous german welfare state . but beck argues that many immigrants only make welfare claims because they are excluded from the german job market . " yes , there is immigration into the welfare state , " beck conceded .
" but these migrants tend to be ethnic german immigrants who can ’ t get a foothold in the job market , or jewish immigrants -lrb- whose -rrb- ... very respectable professions are often not respected here .
or they are refugees , to whom we effectively deny access to employment . " beck insisted that more should be done to tackle this issue .
the best way forward would be to implement those sections of the immigration act which failed to win a majority in 2004 , she said . thomas kohlmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .
the new law came into effect on jan.1 , 2005 .

under this system , immigrants would receive a point score according to their personal credentials , which would permit them to enter germany , " beck said . but this section of the act floundered in the mediation committee and in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament .
regulations for self-employed people wanting to settle in germany were also severely tightened . self-employed migrants must invest at least one million euros in germany or commit to creating at least 12 further jobs .
beck ’ s particular bone of contention is that access to the german job market is still very difficult for foreign academics who have studied in germany . germany needs immigration meanwhile , most observers agree germany needs immigration .
but how can the country be sure to prevent an influx of poorly-qualified economic migrants ? " first we need to make it clear once and for all that the recruitment of unqualified labor was national policy in the 50s and 60s , " asserted beck .
" we have accepted this responsibility , and we must make allowances for this , for example with extensive education strategies directed at the children of first- and second-generation immigrants . " migration is the future advocates of liberal immigration policies emphasize that germany will need even more migrants in the future in order to stabilize its social security system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy needs qualified immigrants in order to thrive .
while that may be true in theory , the reality can be quite different , beck said .
many immigrant families come to germany and make claims on the welfare system , and economics experts warn of an unchecked flow of migrants seeking the fruits of the generous german welfare state . but beck argues that many immigrants only make welfare claims because they are excluded from the german job market . " yes , there is immigration into the welfare state , " beck conceded .
" but these migrants tend to be ethnic german immigrants who can ’ t get a foothold in the job market , or jewish immigrants -lrb- whose -rrb- ... very respectable professions are often not respected here .

" we will continue negotiating with them , but on the other hand we will not restrict our negotiations to being with just these three countries , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said of the so-called eu-3 . britain , france and germany have been engaged in close to two years of tough talks with the islamic republic but asefi said that iran has now also been talking with countries such as japan , malaysia and south africa . " we want to have negotiations with other countries , it is up to the europeans not to remove themselves from the negotiations , " he said , accusing the eu-3 of refusing to recognize iran 's right to the nuclear fuel cycle . countries from the non-aligned movement - notably south africa and malaysia - have been more sympathetic to iran 's effort to possess nuclear fuel facilities . " the europeans did not live up to commitments .
if the european can not live up to their commitments , we will negotiate with other countries as is our right , " asefi added . according to asefi , iran 's " main negotiating partner is the international atomic energy agency " - the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog - and said iaea chief mohamed elbaradei had been informed of this . iran unhappy with eu demands iran is unhappy with the eu-3 after they demanded a total halt to fuel cycle work in exchange for a package of trade , security and technology incentives .
iran maintains such work for peaceful purposes is a right of any signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
iran has rejected the deal , and in protest resumed uranium conversion activities , the first step in making enriched uranium which is fuel for power reactors but can also be the raw material for atom bombs . the resumption of this work , which iran had suspended last november to start talks with the eu , has scuttled the negotiations and could lead to iran being brought before the united nations security council for possible sanctions .

the iaea is due to issue a new report on iran on september 3 , and iran has been emboldened by agency conclusions that highly enriched uranium -lrb- heu -rrb- particles found in iran were from imported equipment and not from iran 's own activities .
but the report will also however cover suspicious on iranian work with plutonium , another atom bomb material . " we expect the report on september 3 to clarify the remaining , minute issues because our cooperation has clarified a lot of ambiguities , " asefi insisted . " i do n't think iran 's case can be referred to the un security council .
if they want to make our case a security issue , it will cost the europeans more than it will cost iran , " he warned . more details to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
asefi also revealed further details on promised proposals from iran 's new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , which he suggested would be released within the next six weeks . " they will enshrine iran 's right to have the fuel cycle .
it will also have objective guarantees " that iran will not seek nuclear weapons , asefi said .
" it will say the main negotiating partner will be the iaea .
it will make sure the other parties will not resort to pretexts .
this proposal is a way out of the current situation .
i think around two years of negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- is enough . " the eu-3 have already reacted to iran 's challenge , with france insisting friday that the eu-3 have been working in conjunction with their 22 other eu partners as well as the iaea 's full 35-nation board of governors . the us state department on thursday said iran was trying to " change the subject from what the real issue is , and that is their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons .

bela anda said the two leaders , who are close friends , would discuss " economic ties , especially cooperation in the energy field , but will also talk about international issues . "
the financial times deutschland on friday reported that a contract for the construction of the so-called ost-see gas pipeline was expected to be signed during the visit . the pipeline is a joint project between germany 's eon ruhrgas and russia 's gasprom to feed russian gas directly to germany through the baltic sea from 2010 .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .
" the wolf is n't a mean animal like the one we are familiar with from fairy tales , " said bettina langer from nabu .

" we will continue negotiating with them , but on the other hand we will not restrict our negotiations to being with just these three countries , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said of the so-called eu-3 . britain , france and germany have been engaged in close to two years of tough talks with the islamic republic but asefi said that iran has now also been talking with countries such as japan , malaysia and south africa . " we want to have negotiations with other countries , it is up to the europeans not to remove themselves from the negotiations , " he said , accusing the eu-3 of refusing to recognize iran 's right to the nuclear fuel cycle . countries from the non-aligned movement - notably south africa and malaysia - have been more sympathetic to iran 's effort to possess nuclear fuel facilities . " the europeans did not live up to commitments .
if the european can not live up to their commitments , we will negotiate with other countries as is our right , " asefi added . according to asefi , iran 's " main negotiating partner is the international atomic energy agency " - the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog - and said iaea chief mohamed elbaradei had been informed of this . iran unhappy with eu demands iran is unhappy with the eu-3 after they demanded a total halt to fuel cycle work in exchange for a package of trade , security and technology incentives .

iran has rejected the deal , and in protest resumed uranium conversion activities , the first step in making enriched uranium which is fuel for power reactors but can also be the raw material for atom bombs . the resumption of this work , which iran had suspended last november to start talks with the eu , has scuttled the negotiations and could lead to iran being brought before the united nations security council for possible sanctions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.08.2005 beck : ' germany is open to immigrants ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she sees germany as ' rising to the challenge ' of immigration marieluise beck has been germany 's commissioner for integration for nearly seven years .
in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .
the new law came into effect on jan.1 , 2005 . " with the new immigration law , we ’ ve cleared the way for germany to welcome new migrants and to rise to the challenges of integration , " said beck . canada as a role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers in hamburg if beck and the governing coalition had their way , the new immigration law would have gone a step further still .
they had hoped , for the first time in german history , to build a legal framework that would allow qualified migrants easy access to immigration . " we wanted to adopt the points system , like they have in canada .
under this system , immigrants would receive a point score according to their personal credentials , which would permit them to enter germany , " beck said . but this section of the act floundered in the mediation committee and in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament .
regulations for self-employed people wanting to settle in germany were also severely tightened . self-employed migrants must invest at least one million euros in germany or commit to creating at least 12 further jobs .

" migration is the future advocates of liberal immigration policies emphasize that germany will need even more migrants in the future in order to stabilize its social security system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy needs qualified immigrants in order to thrive .
while that may be true in theory , the reality can be quite different , beck said .
many immigrant families come to germany and make claims on the welfare system , and economics experts warn of an unchecked flow of migrants seeking the fruits of the generous german welfare state . but beck argues that many immigrants only make welfare claims because they are excluded from the german job market . " yes , there is immigration into the welfare state , " beck conceded .
" but these migrants tend to be ethnic german immigrants who can ’ t get a foothold in the job market , or jewish immigrants -lrb- whose -rrb- ... very respectable professions are often not respected here .
or they are refugees , to whom we effectively deny access to employment . " beck insisted that more should be done to tackle this issue .

in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .

" we will continue negotiating with them , but on the other hand we will not restrict our negotiations to being with just these three countries , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said of the so-called eu-3 . britain , france and germany have been engaged in close to two years of tough talks with the islamic republic but asefi said that iran has now also been talking with countries such as japan , malaysia and south africa . " we want to have negotiations with other countries , it is up to the europeans not to remove themselves from the negotiations , " he said , accusing the eu-3 of refusing to recognize iran 's right to the nuclear fuel cycle . countries from the non-aligned movement - notably south africa and malaysia - have been more sympathetic to iran 's effort to possess nuclear fuel facilities . " the europeans did not live up to commitments .
if the european can not live up to their commitments , we will negotiate with other countries as is our right , " asefi added . according to asefi , iran 's " main negotiating partner is the international atomic energy agency " - the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog - and said iaea chief mohamed elbaradei had been informed of this . iran unhappy with eu demands iran is unhappy with the eu-3 after they demanded a total halt to fuel cycle work in exchange for a package of trade , security and technology incentives .
iran maintains such work for peaceful purposes is a right of any signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
iran has rejected the deal , and in protest resumed uranium conversion activities , the first step in making enriched uranium which is fuel for power reactors but can also be the raw material for atom bombs . the resumption of this work , which iran had suspended last november to start talks with the eu , has scuttled the negotiations and could lead to iran being brought before the united nations security council for possible sanctions .

9 , 2005 at vienna 's international center .
the meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors came a day after iran restarted some activities at its nuclear plant at the central iranian city of isfahan .
the iaea is due to issue a new report on iran on september 3 , and iran has been emboldened by agency conclusions that highly enriched uranium -lrb- heu -rrb- particles found in iran were from imported equipment and not from iran 's own activities .
but the report will also however cover suspicious on iranian work with plutonium , another atom bomb material . " we expect the report on september 3 to clarify the remaining , minute issues because our cooperation has clarified a lot of ambiguities , " asefi insisted . " i do n't think iran 's case can be referred to the un security council .
if they want to make our case a security issue , it will cost the europeans more than it will cost iran , " he warned . more details to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
asefi also revealed further details on promised proposals from iran 's new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , which he suggested would be released within the next six weeks . " they will enshrine iran 's right to have the fuel cycle .
it will also have objective guarantees " that iran will not seek nuclear weapons , asefi said .
" it will say the main negotiating partner will be the iaea .
it will make sure the other parties will not resort to pretexts .
this proposal is a way out of the current situation .
i think around two years of negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- is enough . " the eu-3 have already reacted to iran 's challenge , with france insisting friday that the eu-3 have been working in conjunction with their 22 other eu partners as well as the iaea 's full 35-nation board of governors . the us state department on thursday said iran was trying to " change the subject from what the real issue is , and that is their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons .

now , a new study from switzerland adds scientific proof of humor 's therapeutic effects . studies have shown the benefits of a prolonged guffaw to strengthen the immune system and help people suffering from depression overcome their condition .
these days , clowns are a standard fixture in children 's clinics for their well-known ability to spread laughter and joy .
now , a new study by scientists from the university of zurich has added to the empirical evidence supporting humor therapy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monty python comedian john cleese is seen in this 1987 picture .
willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .
ruch and his team wanted to know why . to explain the results of the " cold pressure test , " ruch said there were many possibilities . " the crazy thing about this research is that , in principal , there are many possible explanations , " he told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
" it could be the distraction , it could be the relaxation .
it could be the increased distribution of endorphins .
however , in separate studies , none of these single causes alone seems to work . " film a pai n- killer ? ruch went further into his experiment to find out whether the pain-lessening films shown to the participants had to be of a comedic nature in order for them to have an effect .
the results were , once again , surprising . when ruch had the test subjects view non-comedic films , either dramas or tragedies , a distinct pain-reducing effect could be observed .
this effect could only be observed , however , when the " cold pressure test " was administered immediately following the film viewing , at least for the non-comedic films . bildunterschrift : " if you waited half an hour , then there were no effects observable for the tragic films , " ruch said .
" as for the comedic films , these continued to have an effect .
this shows that whatever is triggered by viewing the comedic films sustains itself over time . " strangely , the subjects did not consciously admit to being in a humorous mood half an hour after viewing the funny films . " this is a really paradoxical result of our study , " ruch said .
" the comedic films do n't have a conscious effect after half an hour , but the physical endurance of pain after watching these films is equally strong as it was at the end of the film . " laughter is the best medici n e this result showed ruch that the films did not have to be laughter-inducing in order for there to be a pain-reducing effect ; however , for longer-term amelioration , it certainly helped .
perhaps this result alone is more important than a precise , scientific explanation of the phenomenon . ruch said he is hopeful that humor will be viewed by the medical community as a legitimate means for allowing patients to decrease their intake of pain killers .
he is optimistic that more cooperative studies with hospitals can lead to more empirical proof of the pain-reducing effects of laughter through comedy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chocolate every day keeps the doctor away it makes you fat , it 's loaded with caffeine , high in cholesterol , and bad for your skin .

" as for the comedic films , these continued to have an effect .
this shows that whatever is triggered by viewing the comedic films sustains itself over time . " strangely , the subjects did not consciously admit to being in a humorous mood half an hour after viewing the funny films . " this is a really paradoxical result of our study , " ruch said .
" the comedic films do n't have a conscious effect after half an hour , but the physical endurance of pain after watching these films is equally strong as it was at the end of the film . " laughter is the best medici n e this result showed ruch that the films did not have to be laughter-inducing in order for there to be a pain-reducing effect ; however , for longer-term amelioration , it certainly helped .
perhaps this result alone is more important than a precise , scientific explanation of the phenomenon . ruch said he is hopeful that humor will be viewed by the medical community as a legitimate means for allowing patients to decrease their intake of pain killers .
he is optimistic that more cooperative studies with hospitals can lead to more empirical proof of the pain-reducing effects of laughter through comedy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chocolate every day keeps the doctor away it makes you fat , it 's loaded with caffeine , high in cholesterol , and bad for your skin .

in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .
the new law came into effect on jan.1 , 2005 . " with the new immigration law , we ’ ve cleared the way for germany to welcome new migrants and to rise to the challenges of integration , " said beck . canada as a role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers in hamburg if beck and the governing coalition had their way , the new immigration law would have gone a step further still .

in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .
the new law came into effect on jan.1 , 2005 . " with the new immigration law , we ’ ve cleared the way for germany to welcome new migrants and to rise to the challenges of integration , " said beck . canada as a role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers in hamburg if beck and the governing coalition had their way , the new immigration law would have gone a step further still .

willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .
ruch and his team wanted to know why . to explain the results of the " cold pressure test , " ruch said there were many possibilities . " the crazy thing about this research is that , in principal , there are many possible explanations , " he told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .

the results were , once again , surprising . when ruch had the test subjects view non-comedic films , either dramas or tragedies , a distinct pain-reducing effect could be observed .
this effect could only be observed , however , when the " cold pressure test " was administered immediately following the film viewing , at least for the non-comedic films . bildunterschrift : " if you waited half an hour , then there were no effects observable for the tragic films , " ruch said .
" as for the comedic films , these continued to have an effect .
this shows that whatever is triggered by viewing the comedic films sustains itself over time . " strangely , the subjects did not consciously admit to being in a humorous mood half an hour after viewing the funny films . " this is a really paradoxical result of our study , " ruch said .
" the comedic films do n't have a conscious effect after half an hour , but the physical endurance of pain after watching these films is equally strong as it was at the end of the film . " laughter is the best medici n e this result showed ruch that the films did not have to be laughter-inducing in order for there to be a pain-reducing effect ; however , for longer-term amelioration , it certainly helped .
perhaps this result alone is more important than a precise , scientific explanation of the phenomenon . ruch said he is hopeful that humor will be viewed by the medical community as a legitimate means for allowing patients to decrease their intake of pain killers .

however , in separate studies , none of these single causes alone seems to work . " film a pai n- killer ? ruch went further into his experiment to find out whether the pain-lessening films shown to the participants had to be of a comedic nature in order for them to have an effect .
the results were , once again , surprising . when ruch had the test subjects view non-comedic films , either dramas or tragedies , a distinct pain-reducing effect could be observed .
this effect could only be observed , however , when the " cold pressure test " was administered immediately following the film viewing , at least for the non-comedic films . bildunterschrift : " if you waited half an hour , then there were no effects observable for the tragic films , " ruch said .
" as for the comedic films , these continued to have an effect .
this shows that whatever is triggered by viewing the comedic films sustains itself over time . " strangely , the subjects did not consciously admit to being in a humorous mood half an hour after viewing the funny films . " this is a really paradoxical result of our study , " ruch said .
" the comedic films do n't have a conscious effect after half an hour , but the physical endurance of pain after watching these films is equally strong as it was at the end of the film . " laughter is the best medici n e this result showed ruch that the films did not have to be laughter-inducing in order for there to be a pain-reducing effect ; however , for longer-term amelioration , it certainly helped .
perhaps this result alone is more important than a precise , scientific explanation of the phenomenon . ruch said he is hopeful that humor will be viewed by the medical community as a legitimate means for allowing patients to decrease their intake of pain killers .
he is optimistic that more cooperative studies with hospitals can lead to more empirical proof of the pain-reducing effects of laughter through comedy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chocolate every day keeps the doctor away it makes you fat , it 's loaded with caffeine , high in cholesterol , and bad for your skin .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .

now , a new study from switzerland adds scientific proof of humor 's therapeutic effects . studies have shown the benefits of a prolonged guffaw to strengthen the immune system and help people suffering from depression overcome their condition .
these days , clowns are a standard fixture in children 's clinics for their well-known ability to spread laughter and joy .

willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .
ruch and his team wanted to know why . to explain the results of the " cold pressure test , " ruch said there were many possibilities . " the crazy thing about this research is that , in principal , there are many possible explanations , " he told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .

the results were , once again , surprising . when ruch had the test subjects view non-comedic films , either dramas or tragedies , a distinct pain-reducing effect could be observed .
this effect could only be observed , however , when the " cold pressure test " was administered immediately following the film viewing , at least for the non-comedic films . bildunterschrift : " if you waited half an hour , then there were no effects observable for the tragic films , " ruch said .
" as for the comedic films , these continued to have an effect .
this shows that whatever is triggered by viewing the comedic films sustains itself over time . " strangely , the subjects did not consciously admit to being in a humorous mood half an hour after viewing the funny films . " this is a really paradoxical result of our study , " ruch said .
" the comedic films do n't have a conscious effect after half an hour , but the physical endurance of pain after watching these films is equally strong as it was at the end of the film . " laughter is the best medici n e this result showed ruch that the films did not have to be laughter-inducing in order for there to be a pain-reducing effect ; however , for longer-term amelioration , it certainly helped .
perhaps this result alone is more important than a precise , scientific explanation of the phenomenon . ruch said he is hopeful that humor will be viewed by the medical community as a legitimate means for allowing patients to decrease their intake of pain killers .

now , a new study from switzerland adds scientific proof of humor 's therapeutic effects . studies have shown the benefits of a prolonged guffaw to strengthen the immune system and help people suffering from depression overcome their condition .
these days , clowns are a standard fixture in children 's clinics for their well-known ability to spread laughter and joy .
now , a new study by scientists from the university of zurich has added to the empirical evidence supporting humor therapy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monty python comedian john cleese is seen in this 1987 picture .
willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .
ruch and his team wanted to know why . to explain the results of the " cold pressure test , " ruch said there were many possibilities . " the crazy thing about this research is that , in principal , there are many possible explanations , " he told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .

this effect could only be observed , however , when the " cold pressure test " was administered immediately following the film viewing , at least for the non-comedic films . bildunterschrift : " if you waited half an hour , then there were no effects observable for the tragic films , " ruch said .
" as for the comedic films , these continued to have an effect .
this shows that whatever is triggered by viewing the comedic films sustains itself over time . " strangely , the subjects did not consciously admit to being in a humorous mood half an hour after viewing the funny films . " this is a really paradoxical result of our study , " ruch said .
" the comedic films do n't have a conscious effect after half an hour , but the physical endurance of pain after watching these films is equally strong as it was at the end of the film . " laughter is the best medici n e this result showed ruch that the films did not have to be laughter-inducing in order for there to be a pain-reducing effect ; however , for longer-term amelioration , it certainly helped .
perhaps this result alone is more important than a precise , scientific explanation of the phenomenon . ruch said he is hopeful that humor will be viewed by the medical community as a legitimate means for allowing patients to decrease their intake of pain killers .

willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .

" the comedic films do n't have a conscious effect after half an hour , but the physical endurance of pain after watching these films is equally strong as it was at the end of the film . " laughter is the best medici n e this result showed ruch that the films did not have to be laughter-inducing in order for there to be a pain-reducing effect ; however , for longer-term amelioration , it certainly helped .
perhaps this result alone is more important than a precise , scientific explanation of the phenomenon . ruch said he is hopeful that humor will be viewed by the medical community as a legitimate means for allowing patients to decrease their intake of pain killers .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .

firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .

now , a new study from switzerland adds scientific proof of humor 's therapeutic effects . studies have shown the benefits of a prolonged guffaw to strengthen the immune system and help people suffering from depression overcome their condition .
these days , clowns are a standard fixture in children 's clinics for their well-known ability to spread laughter and joy .
now , a new study by scientists from the university of zurich has added to the empirical evidence supporting humor therapy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monty python comedian john cleese is seen in this 1987 picture .
willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .
ruch and his team wanted to know why . to explain the results of the " cold pressure test , " ruch said there were many possibilities . " the crazy thing about this research is that , in principal , there are many possible explanations , " he told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
" it could be the distraction , it could be the relaxation .
it could be the increased distribution of endorphins .
however , in separate studies , none of these single causes alone seems to work . " film a pai n- killer ? ruch went further into his experiment to find out whether the pain-lessening films shown to the participants had to be of a comedic nature in order for them to have an effect .
the results were , once again , surprising . when ruch had the test subjects view non-comedic films , either dramas or tragedies , a distinct pain-reducing effect could be observed .
this effect could only be observed , however , when the " cold pressure test " was administered immediately following the film viewing , at least for the non-comedic films . bildunterschrift : " if you waited half an hour , then there were no effects observable for the tragic films , " ruch said .
" as for the comedic films , these continued to have an effect .
this shows that whatever is triggered by viewing the comedic films sustains itself over time . " strangely , the subjects did not consciously admit to being in a humorous mood half an hour after viewing the funny films . " this is a really paradoxical result of our study , " ruch said .
" the comedic films do n't have a conscious effect after half an hour , but the physical endurance of pain after watching these films is equally strong as it was at the end of the film . " laughter is the best medici n e this result showed ruch that the films did not have to be laughter-inducing in order for there to be a pain-reducing effect ; however , for longer-term amelioration , it certainly helped .
perhaps this result alone is more important than a precise , scientific explanation of the phenomenon . ruch said he is hopeful that humor will be viewed by the medical community as a legitimate means for allowing patients to decrease their intake of pain killers .
he is optimistic that more cooperative studies with hospitals can lead to more empirical proof of the pain-reducing effects of laughter through comedy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chocolate every day keeps the doctor away it makes you fat , it 's loaded with caffeine , high in cholesterol , and bad for your skin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.08.2005 wolves , bears make comeback in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are wolves making a happy return or just plain trouble for germany ?
bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .
" the wolf is n't a mean animal like the one we are familiar with from fairy tales , " said bettina langer from nabu .
" they do n't eat grandmothers .

" the europeans did not live up to commitments .
if the european can not live up to their commitments , we will negotiate with other countries as is our right , " asefi added . according to asefi , iran 's " main negotiating partner is the international atomic energy agency " - the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog - and said iaea chief mohamed elbaradei had been informed of this . iran unhappy with eu demands iran is unhappy with the eu-3 after they demanded a total halt to fuel cycle work in exchange for a package of trade , security and technology incentives .
iran maintains such work for peaceful purposes is a right of any signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
iran has rejected the deal , and in protest resumed uranium conversion activities , the first step in making enriched uranium which is fuel for power reactors but can also be the raw material for atom bombs . the resumption of this work , which iran had suspended last november to start talks with the eu , has scuttled the negotiations and could lead to iran being brought before the united nations security council for possible sanctions .

in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .

under this system , immigrants would receive a point score according to their personal credentials , which would permit them to enter germany , " beck said . but this section of the act floundered in the mediation committee and in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament .
regulations for self-employed people wanting to settle in germany were also severely tightened . self-employed migrants must invest at least one million euros in germany or commit to creating at least 12 further jobs .
beck ’ s particular bone of contention is that access to the german job market is still very difficult for foreign academics who have studied in germany . germany needs immigration meanwhile , most observers agree germany needs immigration .
but how can the country be sure to prevent an influx of poorly-qualified economic migrants ? " first we need to make it clear once and for all that the recruitment of unqualified labor was national policy in the 50s and 60s , " asserted beck .
" we have accepted this responsibility , and we must make allowances for this , for example with extensive education strategies directed at the children of first- and second-generation immigrants .

many immigrant families come to germany and make claims on the welfare system , and economics experts warn of an unchecked flow of migrants seeking the fruits of the generous german welfare state . but beck argues that many immigrants only make welfare claims because they are excluded from the german job market . " yes , there is immigration into the welfare state , " beck conceded .
" but these migrants tend to be ethnic german immigrants who can ’ t get a foothold in the job market , or jewish immigrants -lrb- whose -rrb- ... very respectable professions are often not respected here .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .
" the wolf is n't a mean animal like the one we are familiar with from fairy tales , " said bettina langer from nabu .
" they do n't eat grandmothers .

in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .
the new law came into effect on jan.1 , 2005 . " with the new immigration law , we ’ ve cleared the way for germany to welcome new migrants and to rise to the challenges of integration , " said beck . canada as a role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers in hamburg if beck and the governing coalition had their way , the new immigration law would have gone a step further still .
they had hoped , for the first time in german history , to build a legal framework that would allow qualified migrants easy access to immigration . " we wanted to adopt the points system , like they have in canada .
under this system , immigrants would receive a point score according to their personal credentials , which would permit them to enter germany , " beck said . but this section of the act floundered in the mediation committee and in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament .
regulations for self-employed people wanting to settle in germany were also severely tightened . self-employed migrants must invest at least one million euros in germany or commit to creating at least 12 further jobs .
beck ’ s particular bone of contention is that access to the german job market is still very difficult for foreign academics who have studied in germany . germany needs immigration meanwhile , most observers agree germany needs immigration .
but how can the country be sure to prevent an influx of poorly-qualified economic migrants ? " first we need to make it clear once and for all that the recruitment of unqualified labor was national policy in the 50s and 60s , " asserted beck .
" we have accepted this responsibility , and we must make allowances for this , for example with extensive education strategies directed at the children of first- and second-generation immigrants . " migration is the future advocates of liberal immigration policies emphasize that germany will need even more migrants in the future in order to stabilize its social security system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy needs qualified immigrants in order to thrive .
while that may be true in theory , the reality can be quite different , beck said .
many immigrant families come to germany and make claims on the welfare system , and economics experts warn of an unchecked flow of migrants seeking the fruits of the generous german welfare state . but beck argues that many immigrants only make welfare claims because they are excluded from the german job market . " yes , there is immigration into the welfare state , " beck conceded .
" but these migrants tend to be ethnic german immigrants who can ’ t get a foothold in the job market , or jewish immigrants -lrb- whose -rrb- ... very respectable professions are often not respected here .
or they are refugees , to whom we effectively deny access to employment . " beck insisted that more should be done to tackle this issue .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .

now , a new study from switzerland adds scientific proof of humor 's therapeutic effects . studies have shown the benefits of a prolonged guffaw to strengthen the immune system and help people suffering from depression overcome their condition .
these days , clowns are a standard fixture in children 's clinics for their well-known ability to spread laughter and joy .
now , a new study by scientists from the university of zurich has added to the empirical evidence supporting humor therapy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monty python comedian john cleese is seen in this 1987 picture .
willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .
ruch and his team wanted to know why . to explain the results of the " cold pressure test , " ruch said there were many possibilities . " the crazy thing about this research is that , in principal , there are many possible explanations , " he told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
" it could be the distraction , it could be the relaxation .
it could be the increased distribution of endorphins .

" we will continue negotiating with them , but on the other hand we will not restrict our negotiations to being with just these three countries , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said of the so-called eu-3 . britain , france and germany have been engaged in close to two years of tough talks with the islamic republic but asefi said that iran has now also been talking with countries such as japan , malaysia and south africa . " we want to have negotiations with other countries , it is up to the europeans not to remove themselves from the negotiations , " he said , accusing the eu-3 of refusing to recognize iran 's right to the nuclear fuel cycle . countries from the non-aligned movement - notably south africa and malaysia - have been more sympathetic to iran 's effort to possess nuclear fuel facilities . " the europeans did not live up to commitments .
if the european can not live up to their commitments , we will negotiate with other countries as is our right , " asefi added . according to asefi , iran 's " main negotiating partner is the international atomic energy agency " - the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog - and said iaea chief mohamed elbaradei had been informed of this . iran unhappy with eu demands iran is unhappy with the eu-3 after they demanded a total halt to fuel cycle work in exchange for a package of trade , security and technology incentives .
iran maintains such work for peaceful purposes is a right of any signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
iran has rejected the deal , and in protest resumed uranium conversion activities , the first step in making enriched uranium which is fuel for power reactors but can also be the raw material for atom bombs . the resumption of this work , which iran had suspended last november to start talks with the eu , has scuttled the negotiations and could lead to iran being brought before the united nations security council for possible sanctions .

9 , 2005 at vienna 's international center .
the meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors came a day after iran restarted some activities at its nuclear plant at the central iranian city of isfahan .
the iaea is due to issue a new report on iran on september 3 , and iran has been emboldened by agency conclusions that highly enriched uranium -lrb- heu -rrb- particles found in iran were from imported equipment and not from iran 's own activities .
but the report will also however cover suspicious on iranian work with plutonium , another atom bomb material . " we expect the report on september 3 to clarify the remaining , minute issues because our cooperation has clarified a lot of ambiguities , " asefi insisted . " i do n't think iran 's case can be referred to the un security council .
if they want to make our case a security issue , it will cost the europeans more than it will cost iran , " he warned . more details to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
asefi also revealed further details on promised proposals from iran 's new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , which he suggested would be released within the next six weeks . " they will enshrine iran 's right to have the fuel cycle .
it will also have objective guarantees " that iran will not seek nuclear weapons , asefi said .
" it will say the main negotiating partner will be the iaea .
it will make sure the other parties will not resort to pretexts .
this proposal is a way out of the current situation .
i think around two years of negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- is enough . " the eu-3 have already reacted to iran 's challenge , with france insisting friday that the eu-3 have been working in conjunction with their 22 other eu partners as well as the iaea 's full 35-nation board of governors . the us state department on thursday said iran was trying to " change the subject from what the real issue is , and that is their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons .

9 , 2005 at vienna 's international center .
the meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors came a day after iran restarted some activities at its nuclear plant at the central iranian city of isfahan .
the iaea is due to issue a new report on iran on september 3 , and iran has been emboldened by agency conclusions that highly enriched uranium -lrb- heu -rrb- particles found in iran were from imported equipment and not from iran 's own activities .
but the report will also however cover suspicious on iranian work with plutonium , another atom bomb material . " we expect the report on september 3 to clarify the remaining , minute issues because our cooperation has clarified a lot of ambiguities , " asefi insisted . " i do n't think iran 's case can be referred to the un security council .
if they want to make our case a security issue , it will cost the europeans more than it will cost iran , " he warned . more details to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
asefi also revealed further details on promised proposals from iran 's new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , which he suggested would be released within the next six weeks . " they will enshrine iran 's right to have the fuel cycle .
it will also have objective guarantees " that iran will not seek nuclear weapons , asefi said .
" it will say the main negotiating partner will be the iaea .
it will make sure the other parties will not resort to pretexts .
this proposal is a way out of the current situation .
i think around two years of negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- is enough . " the eu-3 have already reacted to iran 's challenge , with france insisting friday that the eu-3 have been working in conjunction with their 22 other eu partners as well as the iaea 's full 35-nation board of governors . the us state department on thursday said iran was trying to " change the subject from what the real issue is , and that is their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .
" the wolf is n't a mean animal like the one we are familiar with from fairy tales , " said bettina langer from nabu .
" they do n't eat grandmothers .

" we will continue negotiating with them , but on the other hand we will not restrict our negotiations to being with just these three countries , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said of the so-called eu-3 . britain , france and germany have been engaged in close to two years of tough talks with the islamic republic but asefi said that iran has now also been talking with countries such as japan , malaysia and south africa . " we want to have negotiations with other countries , it is up to the europeans not to remove themselves from the negotiations , " he said , accusing the eu-3 of refusing to recognize iran 's right to the nuclear fuel cycle . countries from the non-aligned movement - notably south africa and malaysia - have been more sympathetic to iran 's effort to possess nuclear fuel facilities . " the europeans did not live up to commitments .
if the european can not live up to their commitments , we will negotiate with other countries as is our right , " asefi added . according to asefi , iran 's " main negotiating partner is the international atomic energy agency " - the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog - and said iaea chief mohamed elbaradei had been informed of this . iran unhappy with eu demands iran is unhappy with the eu-3 after they demanded a total halt to fuel cycle work in exchange for a package of trade , security and technology incentives .
iran maintains such work for peaceful purposes is a right of any signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
iran has rejected the deal , and in protest resumed uranium conversion activities , the first step in making enriched uranium which is fuel for power reactors but can also be the raw material for atom bombs . the resumption of this work , which iran had suspended last november to start talks with the eu , has scuttled the negotiations and could lead to iran being brought before the united nations security council for possible sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohammed elbaradei , left , prior the start of the iaea 's emergency meeting on iran 's latest nuclear activities on tuesday , aug .
9 , 2005 at vienna 's international center .
the meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors came a day after iran restarted some activities at its nuclear plant at the central iranian city of isfahan .
the iaea is due to issue a new report on iran on september 3 , and iran has been emboldened by agency conclusions that highly enriched uranium -lrb- heu -rrb- particles found in iran were from imported equipment and not from iran 's own activities .
but the report will also however cover suspicious on iranian work with plutonium , another atom bomb material . " we expect the report on september 3 to clarify the remaining , minute issues because our cooperation has clarified a lot of ambiguities , " asefi insisted . " i do n't think iran 's case can be referred to the un security council .
if they want to make our case a security issue , it will cost the europeans more than it will cost iran , " he warned . more details to come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
asefi also revealed further details on promised proposals from iran 's new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , which he suggested would be released within the next six weeks . " they will enshrine iran 's right to have the fuel cycle .
it will also have objective guarantees " that iran will not seek nuclear weapons , asefi said .
" it will say the main negotiating partner will be the iaea .
it will make sure the other parties will not resort to pretexts .
this proposal is a way out of the current situation .
i think around two years of negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- is enough . " the eu-3 have already reacted to iran 's challenge , with france insisting friday that the eu-3 have been working in conjunction with their 22 other eu partners as well as the iaea 's full 35-nation board of governors . the us state department on thursday said iran was trying to " change the subject from what the real issue is , and that is their continued pursuit of nuclear weapons .

but how can the country be sure to prevent an influx of poorly-qualified economic migrants ? " first we need to make it clear once and for all that the recruitment of unqualified labor was national policy in the 50s and 60s , " asserted beck .

in an interview with dw-world , she cited the 2004 immigration act as her greatest achievement . at 25 percent , the rate of unemployment among foreigners is double that of native germans .
despite this , the federal minister for migration , marieluise beck , is convinced that she has made significant progress during her almost seven years in office . for beck , the keystone of the current government 's immigration policy is the immigration act , which was passed in august 2004 following hard wrangling with the opposition .
the new law came into effect on jan.1 , 2005 . " with the new immigration law , we ’ ve cleared the way for germany to welcome new migrants and to rise to the challenges of integration , " said beck . canada as a role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers in hamburg if beck and the governing coalition had their way , the new immigration law would have gone a step further still .
they had hoped , for the first time in german history , to build a legal framework that would allow qualified migrants easy access to immigration . " we wanted to adopt the points system , like they have in canada .
under this system , immigrants would receive a point score according to their personal credentials , which would permit them to enter germany , " beck said . but this section of the act floundered in the mediation committee and in the bundesrat , the german upper house of parliament .
regulations for self-employed people wanting to settle in germany were also severely tightened . self-employed migrants must invest at least one million euros in germany or commit to creating at least 12 further jobs .
beck ’ s particular bone of contention is that access to the german job market is still very difficult for foreign academics who have studied in germany . germany needs immigration meanwhile , most observers agree germany needs immigration .
but how can the country be sure to prevent an influx of poorly-qualified economic migrants ? " first we need to make it clear once and for all that the recruitment of unqualified labor was national policy in the 50s and 60s , " asserted beck .
" we have accepted this responsibility , and we must make allowances for this , for example with extensive education strategies directed at the children of first- and second-generation immigrants . " migration is the future advocates of liberal immigration policies emphasize that germany will need even more migrants in the future in order to stabilize its social security system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy needs qualified immigrants in order to thrive .
while that may be true in theory , the reality can be quite different , beck said .
many immigrant families come to germany and make claims on the welfare system , and economics experts warn of an unchecked flow of migrants seeking the fruits of the generous german welfare state . but beck argues that many immigrants only make welfare claims because they are excluded from the german job market . " yes , there is immigration into the welfare state , " beck conceded .
" but these migrants tend to be ethnic german immigrants who can ’ t get a foothold in the job market , or jewish immigrants -lrb- whose -rrb- ... very respectable professions are often not respected here .
or they are refugees , to whom we effectively deny access to employment . " beck insisted that more should be done to tackle this issue .
the best way forward would be to implement those sections of the immigration act which failed to win a majority in 2004 , she said . thomas kohlmann -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

" the europeans did not live up to commitments .
if the european can not live up to their commitments , we will negotiate with other countries as is our right , " asefi added . according to asefi , iran 's " main negotiating partner is the international atomic energy agency " - the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog - and said iaea chief mohamed elbaradei had been informed of this . iran unhappy with eu demands iran is unhappy with the eu-3 after they demanded a total halt to fuel cycle work in exchange for a package of trade , security and technology incentives .
iran maintains such work for peaceful purposes is a right of any signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
iran has rejected the deal , and in protest resumed uranium conversion activities , the first step in making enriched uranium which is fuel for power reactors but can also be the raw material for atom bombs . the resumption of this work , which iran had suspended last november to start talks with the eu , has scuttled the negotiations and could lead to iran being brought before the united nations security council for possible sanctions .

the iaea is due to issue a new report on iran on september 3 , and iran has been emboldened by agency conclusions that highly enriched uranium -lrb- heu -rrb- particles found in iran were from imported equipment and not from iran 's own activities .
but the report will also however cover suspicious on iranian work with plutonium , another atom bomb material . " we expect the report on september 3 to clarify the remaining , minute issues because our cooperation has clarified a lot of ambiguities , " asefi insisted .

it will also have objective guarantees " that iran will not seek nuclear weapons , asefi said .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.08.2005 a really laughable diagnosis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laughter even seems to let people endure the worst kind of outfits laughter and joy have long been known to be effective agents in fighting human pain and suffering .
now , a new study from switzerland adds scientific proof of humor 's therapeutic effects . studies have shown the benefits of a prolonged guffaw to strengthen the immune system and help people suffering from depression overcome their condition .
these days , clowns are a standard fixture in children 's clinics for their well-known ability to spread laughter and joy .
now , a new study by scientists from the university of zurich has added to the empirical evidence supporting humor therapy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monty python comedian john cleese is seen in this 1987 picture .
willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .
ruch and his team wanted to know why . to explain the results of the " cold pressure test , " ruch said there were many possibilities . " the crazy thing about this research is that , in principal , there are many possible explanations , " he told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
" it could be the distraction , it could be the relaxation .
it could be the increased distribution of endorphins .
however , in separate studies , none of these single causes alone seems to work . " film a pai n- killer ? ruch went further into his experiment to find out whether the pain-lessening films shown to the participants had to be of a comedic nature in order for them to have an effect .
the results were , once again , surprising . when ruch had the test subjects view non-comedic films , either dramas or tragedies , a distinct pain-reducing effect could be observed .
this effect could only be observed , however , when the " cold pressure test " was administered immediately following the film viewing , at least for the non-comedic films . bildunterschrift : " if you waited half an hour , then there were no effects observable for the tragic films , " ruch said .

willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .
" the wolf is n't a mean animal like the one we are familiar with from fairy tales , " said bettina langer from nabu .
" they do n't eat grandmothers .

at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .
a wolf expert from germany 's natural preservation society nabu , gesa kluth , has supplied farmers in the lausitz region with tall electrical fences to protect their flocks .
even farm-owner associations now have a more inclusive attitude towards wolves .
dieter tanneberger , president of the association for private farmers , views them as a cultural treasure .
and unlike a century ago , should a sheep be killed by a wolf , a farmer is insured .
but the lausitz-based association has yet to receive a wolf complaint .
fairy tales gave bad name the thought of encountering a wolf or bear in the forest may send chills down hikers ' spines but the chances are rather thin .
in romania , brown bears have recently attacked and killed three humans in a few days ' time .
nevertheless , over half of all germans feel that both humans and wildlife that originally lived in germany can cohabitate peacefully according to a recent opinion poll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolves ' reputations have been smeared in fairy tales , like " little red riding hood " experts say the word must be spread that wild animals only rarely kill humans , usually if a person strays too close to a wolf 's or bear 's cubs , and that they for the most part avoid contact with human civilization .
" the wolf is n't a mean animal like the one we are familiar with from fairy tales , " said bettina langer from nabu .

now , a new study from switzerland adds scientific proof of humor 's therapeutic effects . studies have shown the benefits of a prolonged guffaw to strengthen the immune system and help people suffering from depression overcome their condition .
these days , clowns are a standard fixture in children 's clinics for their well-known ability to spread laughter and joy .
now , a new study by scientists from the university of zurich has added to the empirical evidence supporting humor therapy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monty python comedian john cleese is seen in this 1987 picture .
willibald ruch , the chair of the department of personality psychology and diagnosis , has been leading a study on the effects of comedy on pain .
the participants in the study were all healthy at the outset , but subjected themselves to uncomfortable conditions for the sake of the study .
they first watched funny films , such as monty python , to induce hearty laughter . they were then asked to initiate a painful activity such as the " cold pressure test , " in which subjects immersed a hand in icy water for as long as they could .
after having laughed for a sustained interval prior to the cold immersion , the participants were more able to endure the pain .
ruch and his team wanted to know why . to explain the results of the " cold pressure test , " ruch said there were many possibilities . " the crazy thing about this research is that , in principal , there are many possible explanations , " he told german public radio , deutschlandfunk .
" it could be the distraction , it could be the relaxation .
it could be the increased distribution of endorphins .
however , in separate studies , none of these single causes alone seems to work . " film a pai n- killer ? ruch went further into his experiment to find out whether the pain-lessening films shown to the participants had to be of a comedic nature in order for them to have an effect .
the results were , once again , surprising . when ruch had the test subjects view non-comedic films , either dramas or tragedies , a distinct pain-reducing effect could be observed .
this effect could only be observed , however , when the " cold pressure test " was administered immediately following the film viewing , at least for the non-comedic films . bildunterschrift : " if you waited half an hour , then there were no effects observable for the tragic films , " ruch said .
" as for the comedic films , these continued to have an effect .
this shows that whatever is triggered by viewing the comedic films sustains itself over time . " strangely , the subjects did not consciously admit to being in a humorous mood half an hour after viewing the funny films . " this is a really paradoxical result of our study , " ruch said .
" the comedic films do n't have a conscious effect after half an hour , but the physical endurance of pain after watching these films is equally strong as it was at the end of the film . " laughter is the best medici n e this result showed ruch that the films did not have to be laughter-inducing in order for there to be a pain-reducing effect ; however , for longer-term amelioration , it certainly helped .
perhaps this result alone is more important than a precise , scientific explanation of the phenomenon . ruch said he is hopeful that humor will be viewed by the medical community as a legitimate means for allowing patients to decrease their intake of pain killers .
he is optimistic that more cooperative studies with hospitals can lead to more empirical proof of the pain-reducing effects of laughter through comedy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chocolate every day keeps the doctor away it makes you fat , it 's loaded with caffeine , high in cholesterol , and bad for your skin .

bears in switzerland , wolves in germany .
wildlife that humans had once driven to extinction in central europe is making a return in the 21st century .
the conditions for their survival in modern times look good . the three hikers were absolutely certain .
in the swiss alps , along the border with italy , they sighted a brown bear through their binoculars - the first one in the mountainous country since the last one had been killed in 1904 .
as a result , of the sighting , hotel reservations in the mustair valley region where the bear sighting took place have shot up : european tourists , many who would have to travel a long way to see the ursine creature outside a zoo , found another good reason to visit switzerland .
wildlife such as bears , wolves and lynxes that had been unwelcome , mostly by farmers in agriculturally heavier times , is welcome by environmentalists and even government officials .
the swiss government , anxious to attract the animal that gave the name to its capital , bern , set aside land in the southeast of the country so that bears from a sleuth of some 20 in italy would feel secure enough to wander across the border .
conditions must be right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lynx has also been killed to extinction in some european countries in preparation for a potential return of the bear to switzerland , the wildlife group wwf , based in gland , switzerland , published a report that explained which two factors would make territory attractive for bears .
firstly , there must be enough distance from the bears habitat to human communities and roads .
secondly , the forest must offer enough food .
for wolves it is n't much different .
they have returned to eastern regions in germany because there they have sufficient space to raise their whelps and can find adequate amounts of food .
european farmers worry , though , that if numbers expand too quickly , the reintroduction of predatory animals such as bears , wolves and lynxes to central europe provides a large threat .
for if there is n't enough natural prey , such as rodents or deer , then the supposed traditional food of choice - sheep - frequently are found on farms .
hunters , on the other hand , are concerned about the increased competition for deer .
at the moment , according to the wild biological society of munich , there is enough room in the southeast of germany for 100 to 200 wolves .
improved means of protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown bears this size can only be found in eastern europe and north america the shepherd and cowboy were not always able to protect their sheep from wolves in the past .

" it did not fall outside direction and control as there is no evidence to suggest that it was based on malice .
" as such it is then totally a matter of the professional judgement of the chief constable who , in making these decisions , has to consider his unique relationship with the elected and appointed members of a police authority whose report had been leaked . "
mr davies added that it would have been " disproportionate to ask an outside police force to look into this specific matter . "

the sale of bournemouth 's yellow buses to french company transdev was stopped after it was shown that a local coach firm was blocked from bidding .
four previous bidders will now have until early september to declare their interest in yellow buses .
bournemouth borough council have changed the rules after the criticism .
during the first deal , local coach firm excelsior were effectively blocked as the council insisted private firms trying to buy yellow buses must have assets of £ 5m , while public companies were allowed to bid with assets of only £ 500,000 .
because of this , the department of transport said there was a " significant risk " the sale to transdev could be unlawful .
now the council has changed the rules , and require both private and public bidders to have assets of £ 500,000 .
