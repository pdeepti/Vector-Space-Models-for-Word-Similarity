one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .

but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .

7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .
human rights organizations , on the other hand , have called for more obvious advocacy of civil rights . end of euphoria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human rights protester in beijing , asking for " return of my innocence " instead , berlin concentrates on economic topics .
they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain . " a highly specialized company which brings an internationally leading technology on the chinese market can not be certain that this technology will not be stolen and used in a competing product , not only in china , but eventually also on our own markets , " said professor sandschneider . matthias von hein -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

gmt blast-off on the first expedition to earth 's closest neighbour in over 10 years . " a perfect mission , " said jean-yves le gall , head of starsem , which was in charge of the launch , after the take-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to venus the probe soon emitted its first signal . " the baby cried , " said jean-pierre cau of eads astrium , which built the spacecraft 's propulsion system .
" venus express has begun its operational mission . " venus express will explore the unusual stormy atmosphere and runaway global warming on venus in the hope of better understanding earth 's greenhouse-gas problem . similar , yet differe n t venus , the second planet from the sun , is similar in size , mass and age to earth but has a vastly different and ferociously hot weather system . also known as the evening star , thanks to the bright light it reflects from the sun , the planet is blanketed by thick clouds of suffocating gas driven by often hurricane-force winds and a surface pressure and temperature high enough to crush and melt lead . the planet 's clouds reflect back 80 percent of the sun 's radiation and absorb another 10 percent , leaving just 10 percent to filter down to the surface . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would it look differently on venus ?
but the clouds provide such effective insulation the surface zone becomes a pressure cooker capable of melting metal . " venus has no surface water , a toxic , heavy atmosphere made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- with clouds of sulphuric acid , and at the surface the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times that of earth at sea-level , " the esa notes . the planet 's searing surface temperature of 477 celsius -lrb- 890 fahrenheit -rrb- - the hottest in the solar system - and immense atmospheric pressure have caused many previous missions to fail or send data streams lasting only minutes before their instruments were crushed . ra n ge of tests pla n n ed it is hoped , however , that the 1.27-ton unmanned venus express orbiter will be able to use seven powerful instruments on board to map the planet 's surface and weather system , looking at temperature variation , cloud formations , wind speeds and gas composition . the craft is scheduled to arrive off venus in april , when it will be placed in an elliptical orbit , swooping to as low as 250 kilometers -lrb- 156 miles -rrb- above the surface to a height of 66,000 kilometers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express is already on duty the orbiter , whose total mission costs are 220 million euros -lrb- $ 264 million -rrb- , has enough fuel to operate for 1,000 earth days , according to esa officials . the craft 's sister orbiter mars express is currently on a mission circling mars . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .
that kind of attitude is what we need to change . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

why would you need an army in these times ? - jfellmeth in my opinion , today especially , germany needs its bundeswehr .
it is a factor very important for good german relations with other countries . - ozael absolutely !

when you really find out that you need armed forces is when you do not have them .
then in an unprepared national emergency you really need them - an outside military threat or internal insurrection .
you realize that you need a military in force , in position , already trained .
not having one is an open invitation for someone to attempt to subvert the state by armed means .
germany can stand on its own .
you can not depend on others to defend you .
that is a path to disaster .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .

gmt blast-off on the first expedition to earth 's closest neighbour in over 10 years . " a perfect mission , " said jean-yves le gall , head of starsem , which was in charge of the launch , after the take-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to venus the probe soon emitted its first signal . " the baby cried , " said jean-pierre cau of eads astrium , which built the spacecraft 's propulsion system .
" venus express has begun its operational mission . " venus express will explore the unusual stormy atmosphere and runaway global warming on venus in the hope of better understanding earth 's greenhouse-gas problem . similar , yet differe n t venus , the second planet from the sun , is similar in size , mass and age to earth but has a vastly different and ferociously hot weather system . also known as the evening star , thanks to the bright light it reflects from the sun , the planet is blanketed by thick clouds of suffocating gas driven by often hurricane-force winds and a surface pressure and temperature high enough to crush and melt lead . the planet 's clouds reflect back 80 percent of the sun 's radiation and absorb another 10 percent , leaving just 10 percent to filter down to the surface . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would it look differently on venus ?
but the clouds provide such effective insulation the surface zone becomes a pressure cooker capable of melting metal . " venus has no surface water , a toxic , heavy atmosphere made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- with clouds of sulphuric acid , and at the surface the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times that of earth at sea-level , " the esa notes . the planet 's searing surface temperature of 477 celsius -lrb- 890 fahrenheit -rrb- - the hottest in the solar system - and immense atmospheric pressure have caused many previous missions to fail or send data streams lasting only minutes before their instruments were crushed . ra n ge of tests pla n n ed it is hoped , however , that the 1.27-ton unmanned venus express orbiter will be able to use seven powerful instruments on board to map the planet 's surface and weather system , looking at temperature variation , cloud formations , wind speeds and gas composition . the craft is scheduled to arrive off venus in april , when it will be placed in an elliptical orbit , swooping to as low as 250 kilometers -lrb- 156 miles -rrb- above the surface to a height of 66,000 kilometers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express is already on duty the orbiter , whose total mission costs are 220 million euros -lrb- $ 264 million -rrb- , has enough fuel to operate for 1,000 earth days , according to esa officials . the craft 's sister orbiter mars express is currently on a mission circling mars . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

the court similarly rejected an appeal from privately owned radio hamburg who was challenging the german soccer league 's -lrb- dfl -rrb- right to levee fee 's for the right to broadcast live match reports . the ruling stipulated that clubs were justified in charging broadcast fees for league matches when these were played in stadiums belonging to the clubs . the german soccer league controls 36 first and second-division bundesliga teams . broadcast rights vs. freedom of the press the court battle followed a demand for payment for coverage of games at stadiums belonging to the bundesliga club hamburg sv and st. pauli , a regional division team with a large cult following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no joy for radio hamburg the demand had already been rejected by two lower courts in hamburg .
furthermore , the union of private radio broadcasters -lrb- vprt -rrb- , which had backed the challenge by radio hamburg , said the new ruling would threaten free reporting and said they did not rule out an appeal to germany 's top court , the federal constitutional court . " we consider the decision by the federal court is a threat to free reporting on sport , " said union representatives in a statement . " broadcasting freedom has been subordinated to the interests of the clubs , " said the vprt , and warned that similar issues may arise for text reporters and photographers . the dfl is currently auctioning broadcast rights to matches in the first and second divisions of the bundesliga for the next three seasons . hamburg to appeal yet again # b # radio hamburg said it plans to appeal to the country 's highest court . the union of private radio broadcasters called the ruling a blow to the freedom of the press . the federal court compared radio broadcasters to television rights holders , who pay for live games . no consequences for ard listeners the german public broadcaster ard reacted to the courts decision with acceptance .
" when the federal court upholds the teams right to ownership of broadcast rights , and their right to receive payment for such rights , then one has to accept this fact " , says ard representative rudi kuffner in munich . nothing will change however for ard listeners after the courts ruling . the public broadcaster has secured stadium broadcast rights through legally binding long-term contracts and agreements . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .

all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .

" future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .

figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .

all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .

his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .

but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .
7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .
human rights organizations , on the other hand , have called for more obvious advocacy of civil rights . end of euphoria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human rights protester in beijing , asking for " return of my innocence " instead , berlin concentrates on economic topics .
they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain . " a highly specialized company which brings an internationally leading technology on the chinese market can not be certain that this technology will not be stolen and used in a competing product , not only in china , but eventually also on our own markets , " said professor sandschneider . matthias von hein -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

gmt blast-off on the first expedition to earth 's closest neighbour in over 10 years . " a perfect mission , " said jean-yves le gall , head of starsem , which was in charge of the launch , after the take-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to venus the probe soon emitted its first signal . " the baby cried , " said jean-pierre cau of eads astrium , which built the spacecraft 's propulsion system .
" venus express has begun its operational mission . " venus express will explore the unusual stormy atmosphere and runaway global warming on venus in the hope of better understanding earth 's greenhouse-gas problem . similar , yet differe n t venus , the second planet from the sun , is similar in size , mass and age to earth but has a vastly different and ferociously hot weather system . also known as the evening star , thanks to the bright light it reflects from the sun , the planet is blanketed by thick clouds of suffocating gas driven by often hurricane-force winds and a surface pressure and temperature high enough to crush and melt lead . the planet 's clouds reflect back 80 percent of the sun 's radiation and absorb another 10 percent , leaving just 10 percent to filter down to the surface . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would it look differently on venus ?
but the clouds provide such effective insulation the surface zone becomes a pressure cooker capable of melting metal . " venus has no surface water , a toxic , heavy atmosphere made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- with clouds of sulphuric acid , and at the surface the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times that of earth at sea-level , " the esa notes . the planet 's searing surface temperature of 477 celsius -lrb- 890 fahrenheit -rrb- - the hottest in the solar system - and immense atmospheric pressure have caused many previous missions to fail or send data streams lasting only minutes before their instruments were crushed . ra n ge of tests pla n n ed it is hoped , however , that the 1.27-ton unmanned venus express orbiter will be able to use seven powerful instruments on board to map the planet 's surface and weather system , looking at temperature variation , cloud formations , wind speeds and gas composition . the craft is scheduled to arrive off venus in april , when it will be placed in an elliptical orbit , swooping to as low as 250 kilometers -lrb- 156 miles -rrb- above the surface to a height of 66,000 kilometers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express is already on duty the orbiter , whose total mission costs are 220 million euros -lrb- $ 264 million -rrb- , has enough fuel to operate for 1,000 earth days , according to esa officials . the craft 's sister orbiter mars express is currently on a mission circling mars . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

germany is set to breach the eu 's budget rules for the fifth year in a row in 2006 as growth remains sluggish , the government 's so-called " five wise men " said in their latest forecast published on wednesday . the german economy is set to expand by 0.8 percent this year and then only slightly faster by 1.0 percent next year , the economic advisors to the government forecast in their latest annual report . the panel , which actually comprises four men and one woman , is therefore slightly more cautious on growth than berlin itself , which is officially penciling in growth of 1.2 percent next year . and the slow rate of growth would mean that the state of the country 's public finances would remain very tight , the experts said . " in the current year , german growth remained subdued , " the five wise men found . domestic dema n d still the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding products at a discount has become a german pastime while the external trade environment was favorable , the positive impulses from exports did not spring over to domestic demand . " the registered number of unemployed rose once again and the budget situation remained precarious , " the panel said .
and next year , the economy " is not expected to develop very dynamically either .
at 1.0 percent , growth will again be too weak to bring about any lasting improvement on the labor market . " the persistent weakness of growth was attributable partly to high energy prices , which will further undermine private households ' purchasing power next year , they said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still lacks millions of jobs " the lack of dynamism , in particular on the labor market , shows that germany continues to suffer from deep-seated economic problems , " the report continued .
" even if progress has been made in recent years ... the process of economic reform must continue . " war n i n g agai n st raisi n g sales tax as the incoming government under chancellor-to-be angela merkel tries to put together a program of reforms to get the german economy back on its feet , the wise men warned berlin not to seek to plug the gaping holes in germany 's public purse by raising the sales tax , as is highly likely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany manage to comply with euro zone rules in 2006 ?

all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .

" future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .

the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .

since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .

hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain .

but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .
7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .
human rights organizations , on the other hand , have called for more obvious advocacy of civil rights . end of euphoria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human rights protester in beijing , asking for " return of my innocence " instead , berlin concentrates on economic topics .
they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .
that kind of attitude is what we need to change . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

the court similarly rejected an appeal from privately owned radio hamburg who was challenging the german soccer league 's -lrb- dfl -rrb- right to levee fee 's for the right to broadcast live match reports . the ruling stipulated that clubs were justified in charging broadcast fees for league matches when these were played in stadiums belonging to the clubs . the german soccer league controls 36 first and second-division bundesliga teams . broadcast rights vs. freedom of the press the court battle followed a demand for payment for coverage of games at stadiums belonging to the bundesliga club hamburg sv and st. pauli , a regional division team with a large cult following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no joy for radio hamburg the demand had already been rejected by two lower courts in hamburg .
furthermore , the union of private radio broadcasters -lrb- vprt -rrb- , which had backed the challenge by radio hamburg , said the new ruling would threaten free reporting and said they did not rule out an appeal to germany 's top court , the federal constitutional court . " we consider the decision by the federal court is a threat to free reporting on sport , " said union representatives in a statement . " broadcasting freedom has been subordinated to the interests of the clubs , " said the vprt , and warned that similar issues may arise for text reporters and photographers . the dfl is currently auctioning broadcast rights to matches in the first and second divisions of the bundesliga for the next three seasons . hamburg to appeal yet again # b # radio hamburg said it plans to appeal to the country 's highest court . the union of private radio broadcasters called the ruling a blow to the freedom of the press . the federal court compared radio broadcasters to television rights holders , who pay for live games . no consequences for ard listeners the german public broadcaster ard reacted to the courts decision with acceptance .
" when the federal court upholds the teams right to ownership of broadcast rights , and their right to receive payment for such rights , then one has to accept this fact " , says ard representative rudi kuffner in munich . nothing will change however for ard listeners after the courts ruling . the public broadcaster has secured stadium broadcast rights through legally binding long-term contracts and agreements . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .
7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .
human rights organizations , on the other hand , have called for more obvious advocacy of civil rights . end of euphoria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human rights protester in beijing , asking for " return of my innocence " instead , berlin concentrates on economic topics .
they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain . " a highly specialized company which brings an internationally leading technology on the chinese market can not be certain that this technology will not be stolen and used in a competing product , not only in china , but eventually also on our own markets , " said professor sandschneider . matthias von hein -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .
that kind of attitude is what we need to change . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .

the court similarly rejected an appeal from privately owned radio hamburg who was challenging the german soccer league 's -lrb- dfl -rrb- right to levee fee 's for the right to broadcast live match reports . the ruling stipulated that clubs were justified in charging broadcast fees for league matches when these were played in stadiums belonging to the clubs . the german soccer league controls 36 first and second-division bundesliga teams . broadcast rights vs. freedom of the press the court battle followed a demand for payment for coverage of games at stadiums belonging to the bundesliga club hamburg sv and st. pauli , a regional division team with a large cult following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no joy for radio hamburg the demand had already been rejected by two lower courts in hamburg .

why would you need an army in these times ? - jfellmeth in my opinion , today especially , germany needs its bundeswehr .

when you really find out that you need armed forces is when you do not have them .
then in an unprepared national emergency you really need them - an outside military threat or internal insurrection .
you realize that you need a military in force , in position , already trained .
not having one is an open invitation for someone to attempt to subvert the state by armed means .
germany can stand on its own .
you can not depend on others to defend you .
that is a path to disaster .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .
that kind of attitude is what we need to change . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .

but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .
7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .
human rights organizations , on the other hand , have called for more obvious advocacy of civil rights . end of euphoria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human rights protester in beijing , asking for " return of my innocence " instead , berlin concentrates on economic topics .
they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain . " a highly specialized company which brings an internationally leading technology on the chinese market can not be certain that this technology will not be stolen and used in a competing product , not only in china , but eventually also on our own markets , " said professor sandschneider . matthias von hein -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .

the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .

the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .

thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .

when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .
human rights organizations , on the other hand , have called for more obvious advocacy of civil rights . end of euphoria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human rights protester in beijing , asking for " return of my innocence " instead , berlin concentrates on economic topics .
they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain . " a highly specialized company which brings an internationally leading technology on the chinese market can not be certain that this technology will not be stolen and used in a competing product , not only in china , but eventually also on our own markets , " said professor sandschneider . matthias von hein -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .
that kind of attitude is what we need to change . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

i think the bundeswehr is no longer needed .
europe seems like such a peaceful place , with quiet rides on london 's subways and romantic walks along paris 's fire-lit skies .
why would you need an army in these times ? - jfellmeth in my opinion , today especially , germany needs its bundeswehr .
it is a factor very important for good german relations with other countries . - ozael absolutely !
jawohl !
when you really find out that you need armed forces is when you do not have them .
then in an unprepared national emergency you really need them - an outside military threat or internal insurrection .
you realize that you need a military in force , in position , already trained .
not having one is an open invitation for someone to attempt to subvert the state by armed means .
germany can stand on its own .
you can not depend on others to defend you .
that is a path to disaster .
the reality is germany can only depend on itself ! - robertjewett maybe you should have a look west of the rhine for the answer as to whether germany should have a military .
one may come in handy in the coming years as the population of unassimilated young islamic militants make their bad intentions felt .
it is ironic that after all the pandering to arab opinion by european leaders - by such sordid means as defending saddam , lionizing arafat , attacking the us over it 's arab policies - arabs riot in europe while at the same time find adjusting to life in the " great satan " just fine . - petraronish one only need look at france today to understand clearly that germany still needs the military . - wbjenkins as an " auslander " i do n't think my opinions have any strength -lrb- and that is as it should be -rrb- , but i wonder .
without an army , who or what will defend germany 's interest -lrb- or way of life -rrb- ?
of course , you could go back to depending on outside help -lrb- i.e. the usa -rrb- , but i do n't think you would want that -lrb- nor would we -rrb- .
i think that germany and the rest of europe can afford to defend their interests now , but of course that would cost a lot of money and that would mean less cash for all the welfare " progress " you have made in the past 60 years . - jdmck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : debate needed on army 's future at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future .

" in the current year , german growth remained subdued , " the five wise men found . domestic dema n d still the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding products at a discount has become a german pastime while the external trade environment was favorable , the positive impulses from exports did not spring over to domestic demand . " the registered number of unemployed rose once again and the budget situation remained precarious , " the panel said .
and next year , the economy " is not expected to develop very dynamically either .
at 1.0 percent , growth will again be too weak to bring about any lasting improvement on the labor market . " the persistent weakness of growth was attributable partly to high energy prices , which will further undermine private households ' purchasing power next year , they said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still lacks millions of jobs " the lack of dynamism , in particular on the labor market , shows that germany continues to suffer from deep-seated economic problems , " the report continued .
" even if progress has been made in recent years ... the process of economic reform must continue . " war n i n g agai n st raisi n g sales tax as the incoming government under chancellor-to-be angela merkel tries to put together a program of reforms to get the german economy back on its feet , the wise men warned berlin not to seek to plug the gaping holes in germany 's public purse by raising the sales tax , as is highly likely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany manage to comply with euro zone rules in 2006 ?
the experts also said that germany could still comply with the euro zone 's growth and stability pact in 2006 .
the pact requires members to keep the deficit below 3 percent of gdp .
germany breached this rule in 2002 , 2003 and 2004 and is expected to do so again this year . " savings of around six billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- would suffice , " they wrote .
" the goal is still achievable . " the savings could be achieved by abolishing or lowering tax breaks and subsidies , such as those for own-home purchase , commuting , and sunday , holiday and night shifts , the experts suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on business click here for recent dw-world business stories .

a second decree said that certain powers under the law of april 3 , 1955 governing the state of emergency would come into effect in all or part of 25 regions , which it listed . the 1955 law , enacted at the start of troubles that triggered the war of independence in french-controlled algeria , permits the declaration of curfews , house searches and bans on public meetings . seventy-three percent of french people support the government 's curfew decision , according to a poll to appear in le parisien / aujourd 'hui .
but some have charged that the measure recalls one of the worst moments in the country 's modern history and has painful associations for algerians , the original law 's main targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy , who some have accused of stoking the fires of violence with inflammatory comments .
interior minister nicolas sarkozy vowed on tuesday that the curfews would be implemented " in a manner proportional to the threat " , insisting the french people wanted the government to show " firmness . " towns enforce curfews after midnight decree the first to act under the new powers , the town of amiens north of paris , declared an overnight curfew for unaccompanied under 16-year-olds and a ban on petrol sales to minors , even before the decree comes into force .
mayors have already declared separate , local curfews , in orleans and savigny-sur-orge , both south of paris and in raincy northeast of the capital . across the country , 558 vehicles had been torched at 04:00 utc , compared with 814 at the same time on tuesday , and 204 people arrested , against 143 the previous night , according to national police figures . police claim a calmer night but unrest continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the result of riots in a paris suburb despite the car-burnings , police said the overall situation was calmer than on recent nights , when dozens of police officers were injured , two by gunshot .
" there has been a marked decrease -lrb- in violence -rrb- , particularly in the provinces , and the downward trend is continuing in ile-de-france -lrb- the greater paris region -rrb- , " a national police official said . sarkozy , who was visiting police in southwestern toulouse , a flashpoint of unrest in recent days , said there had been a " fairly significant fall " in the violence . paris riot fever burns unabated in other areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violnece still erupted across france despite the curfew .
earlier , on the outskirts of toulouse , police charged a gang of youths who had attacked them with stones and firebombs .
a gas-powered bus exploded after it came under attack with a molotov cocktail in the bordeaux suburbs , also in the southwest . in southeastern france , lyon 's entire public transport network was shut down after a molotov cocktail was thrown at a train station .
and around 50 youths tried , unsuccessfully , to ram their way into a supermarket in the mediterranean city of marseille . in arras , in northern france , a fire ripped through a shopping centre , spreading from a furniture store to a carpet retailer next door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the riots started in clichy-sous-bois the situation was relatively calm in the northeast paris suburbs where the violence began , police said , with isolated cases of arson and a dozen arrests . meanwhile , ten cars and a motor scooter were set ablaze overnight on wednesday in the german cities of berlin and cologne but police said it was unclear whether there was a connection with the riots sweeping france . in the capital , unidentified vandals ignited six cars and a scooter in the working-class , multi-ethnic districts of wedding and pankow , after five vehicles were set alight the night before .
police said they had no suspects and could not comment on a possible link to the violence in france . in cologne , western germany , four cars were torched .
the authorities said they did not see a connection with the violence in france that has been raging for two weeks .
" we do not have a situation like in paris , " a police spokesman said , adding that night patrols would now be stepped up . earlier in the week , there were similar incidents two nights in a row in the northern port city of bremen . in neighboring belgium , a dozen cars were set alight , although police downplayed concerns about serious violence spreading over the border . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : europe 's lost future the riots in france show that the integration model has failed .

" we consider the decision by the federal court is a threat to free reporting on sport , " said union representatives in a statement . " broadcasting freedom has been subordinated to the interests of the clubs , " said the vprt , and warned that similar issues may arise for text reporters and photographers . the dfl is currently auctioning broadcast rights to matches in the first and second divisions of the bundesliga for the next three seasons . hamburg to appeal yet again # b # radio hamburg said it plans to appeal to the country 's highest court . the union of private radio broadcasters called the ruling a blow to the freedom of the press . the federal court compared radio broadcasters to television rights holders , who pay for live games . no consequences for ard listeners the german public broadcaster ard reacted to the courts decision with acceptance .
" when the federal court upholds the teams right to ownership of broadcast rights , and their right to receive payment for such rights , then one has to accept this fact " , says ard representative rudi kuffner in munich . nothing will change however for ard listeners after the courts ruling . the public broadcaster has secured stadium broadcast rights through legally binding long-term contracts and agreements . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .

some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .

they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain . " a highly specialized company which brings an internationally leading technology on the chinese market can not be certain that this technology will not be stolen and used in a competing product , not only in china , but eventually also on our own markets , " said professor sandschneider . matthias von hein -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

the court similarly rejected an appeal from privately owned radio hamburg who was challenging the german soccer league 's -lrb- dfl -rrb- right to levee fee 's for the right to broadcast live match reports . the ruling stipulated that clubs were justified in charging broadcast fees for league matches when these were played in stadiums belonging to the clubs . the german soccer league controls 36 first and second-division bundesliga teams . broadcast rights vs. freedom of the press the court battle followed a demand for payment for coverage of games at stadiums belonging to the bundesliga club hamburg sv and st. pauli , a regional division team with a large cult following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no joy for radio hamburg the demand had already been rejected by two lower courts in hamburg .
furthermore , the union of private radio broadcasters -lrb- vprt -rrb- , which had backed the challenge by radio hamburg , said the new ruling would threaten free reporting and said they did not rule out an appeal to germany 's top court , the federal constitutional court . " we consider the decision by the federal court is a threat to free reporting on sport , " said union representatives in a statement . " broadcasting freedom has been subordinated to the interests of the clubs , " said the vprt , and warned that similar issues may arise for text reporters and photographers . the dfl is currently auctioning broadcast rights to matches in the first and second divisions of the bundesliga for the next three seasons . hamburg to appeal yet again # b # radio hamburg said it plans to appeal to the country 's highest court . the union of private radio broadcasters called the ruling a blow to the freedom of the press . the federal court compared radio broadcasters to television rights holders , who pay for live games . no consequences for ard listeners the german public broadcaster ard reacted to the courts decision with acceptance .
" when the federal court upholds the teams right to ownership of broadcast rights , and their right to receive payment for such rights , then one has to accept this fact " , says ard representative rudi kuffner in munich . nothing will change however for ard listeners after the courts ruling . the public broadcaster has secured stadium broadcast rights through legally binding long-term contracts and agreements . dw staff -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.11.2005 german-chinese relations at a crossroads ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and hu jintao will meet for the last time in berlin a sharp rise in bilateral trade and direct german investments in china turned the german-chinese relations under chancellor schröder into a success story .
but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .
7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?

when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .

but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .
7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .

a second decree said that certain powers under the law of april 3 , 1955 governing the state of emergency would come into effect in all or part of 25 regions , which it listed . the 1955 law , enacted at the start of troubles that triggered the war of independence in french-controlled algeria , permits the declaration of curfews , house searches and bans on public meetings . seventy-three percent of french people support the government 's curfew decision , according to a poll to appear in le parisien / aujourd 'hui .

germany is set to breach the eu 's budget rules for the fifth year in a row in 2006 as growth remains sluggish , the government 's so-called " five wise men " said in their latest forecast published on wednesday . the german economy is set to expand by 0.8 percent this year and then only slightly faster by 1.0 percent next year , the economic advisors to the government forecast in their latest annual report . the panel , which actually comprises four men and one woman , is therefore slightly more cautious on growth than berlin itself , which is officially penciling in growth of 1.2 percent next year . and the slow rate of growth would mean that the state of the country 's public finances would remain very tight , the experts said . " in the current year , german growth remained subdued , " the five wise men found . domestic dema n d still the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding products at a discount has become a german pastime while the external trade environment was favorable , the positive impulses from exports did not spring over to domestic demand . " the registered number of unemployed rose once again and the budget situation remained precarious , " the panel said .
and next year , the economy " is not expected to develop very dynamically either .
at 1.0 percent , growth will again be too weak to bring about any lasting improvement on the labor market . " the persistent weakness of growth was attributable partly to high energy prices , which will further undermine private households ' purchasing power next year , they said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany still lacks millions of jobs " the lack of dynamism , in particular on the labor market , shows that germany continues to suffer from deep-seated economic problems , " the report continued .
" even if progress has been made in recent years ... the process of economic reform must continue . " war n i n g agai n st raisi n g sales tax as the incoming government under chancellor-to-be angela merkel tries to put together a program of reforms to get the german economy back on its feet , the wise men warned berlin not to seek to plug the gaping holes in germany 's public purse by raising the sales tax , as is highly likely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germany manage to comply with euro zone rules in 2006 ?
the experts also said that germany could still comply with the euro zone 's growth and stability pact in 2006 .
the pact requires members to keep the deficit below 3 percent of gdp .
germany breached this rule in 2002 , 2003 and 2004 and is expected to do so again this year . " savings of around six billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- would suffice , " they wrote .
" the goal is still achievable . " the savings could be achieved by abolishing or lowering tax breaks and subsidies , such as those for own-home purchase , commuting , and sunday , holiday and night shifts , the experts suggested . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on business click here for recent dw-world business stories .

why would you need an army in these times ? - jfellmeth in my opinion , today especially , germany needs its bundeswehr .

when you really find out that you need armed forces is when you do not have them .
then in an unprepared national emergency you really need them - an outside military threat or internal insurrection .
you realize that you need a military in force , in position , already trained .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .
that kind of attitude is what we need to change . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

the experts also said that germany could still comply with the euro zone 's growth and stability pact in 2006 .

germany breached this rule in 2002 , 2003 and 2004 and is expected to do so again this year . " savings of around six billion euros -lrb- $ 7 billion -rrb- would suffice , " they wrote .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .

the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .

figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.11.2005 german-chinese relations at a crossroads ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and hu jintao will meet for the last time in berlin a sharp rise in bilateral trade and direct german investments in china turned the german-chinese relations under chancellor schröder into a success story .
but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .
7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .
human rights organizations , on the other hand , have called for more obvious advocacy of civil rights . end of euphoria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human rights protester in beijing , asking for " return of my innocence " instead , berlin concentrates on economic topics .
they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain . " a highly specialized company which brings an internationally leading technology on the chinese market can not be certain that this technology will not be stolen and used in a competing product , not only in china , but eventually also on our own markets , " said professor sandschneider . matthias von hein -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

germany is set to breach the eu 's budget rules for the fifth year in a row in 2006 as growth remains sluggish , the government 's so-called " five wise men " said in their latest forecast published on wednesday . the german economy is set to expand by 0.8 percent this year and then only slightly faster by 1.0 percent next year , the economic advisors to the government forecast in their latest annual report . the panel , which actually comprises four men and one woman , is therefore slightly more cautious on growth than berlin itself , which is officially penciling in growth of 1.2 percent next year . and the slow rate of growth would mean that the state of the country 's public finances would remain very tight , the experts said . " in the current year , german growth remained subdued , " the five wise men found . domestic dema n d still the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding products at a discount has become a german pastime while the external trade environment was favorable , the positive impulses from exports did not spring over to domestic demand . " the registered number of unemployed rose once again and the budget situation remained precarious , " the panel said .
and next year , the economy " is not expected to develop very dynamically either .
at 1.0 percent , growth will again be too weak to bring about any lasting improvement on the labor market .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .

it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change .

but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .
7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .
human rights organizations , on the other hand , have called for more obvious advocacy of civil rights . end of euphoria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human rights protester in beijing , asking for " return of my innocence " instead , berlin concentrates on economic topics .
they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain . " a highly specialized company which brings an internationally leading technology on the chinese market can not be certain that this technology will not be stolen and used in a competing product , not only in china , but eventually also on our own markets , " said professor sandschneider . matthias von hein -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country . there are days when franka michalski simply wakes up on the wrong side of the bed .
it could be she tossed and turned all night , or it might be raining cats and dogs outside .
but when she goes to her job as a customer support technician at the it firm nutzwerk , she better put on a happy face , or at least keep her dark thoughts to herself .
at her job , moaning and groaning can put you in the unemployment line . the contract she signed when she took the job stipulates that griping on the job is strictly verboten . " after about two months , i learned how to work in this company , " she said .
" now , maybe sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , but then i come to work and my colleague is smiling at me and it makes me happy . " although it might sound like a german remake of " the stepford wives , " the policy put into place at nutzwerk is the company ceo 's attempt to stanch in at least one place what many say is an almost unending flow of verbal woe emanating from german mouths . " in germany , it 's typical to be angry about everything - politicians , the weather , prices , whatever , " said ramona wonneberger , the head of nutzwerk , which provides computer security for clients around the globe and employs 16 people .
" but you can not get to the top if you have employees who are complaining all the time . " no party poopers four years ago , the company put the new sentence into the contract , requiring its employees to have a positive attitude .
it happened after managers noticed that one employee had a continual black cloud over his head , which often got his co-workers all wet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kind of attitude is not what nutzwerk wants no matter how many new clients the company had gotten on board or which new milestone was crossed , the gloomy gus brought the rest of the team down , according to vice president thomas kuwatsch . " so we realized , by not having complaining at the office , people would work better and more effectively , and maybe even have more fun there , " he said .
" if they want to complain , they need to also bring forward a solution to the problem . " most of the firm seems to have signed on to the new philosophy , although there has been at least one person who has been let go because of breach of contract , that is , a bad attitude . happy can help while nutzwerk 's solution to all the public lamenting might seem to lean toward the extreme , general opinion does seem to be that a little more positive thinking could do the county some good . germany 's reputation among some as a land of gray clouds and matching demeanors is unfair , but as with most stereotypes , there is a kernel of truth to it .
while southern europeans are largely seen as life-loving carousers and americans as grinning optimists , germans can come across as dour killjoys , griping non-stop as they zip down their sleek autobahns in their late-model bmws on their way to six weeks of annual vacation in italy or spain . " i think it 's a matter of communication and style that sets germans apart quite strongly from other nations or groups , " said norbert kathmann , a clinical psychologist at berlin 's humboldt university .
" germans tend to put anything negative right up front , and then complain about it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grumpiness has reached the highest levels , some charge he does n't think that germans are more clinically depressed than others , but if they feel unsure about something , or unwell in any way , he says , they tend to let people know about it .
the exact reasons for that are unknown .
while theories as to its origins abound - from the remnants of prussian militarism to the destruction of world war ii and guilt about the nazi period - there is as yet no consensus among experts . but the germans might not be blamed for some of the bellyaching right now .
the country is going through some difficult times .
there is high unemployment , stagnant economic growth and political reforms that have made many germans very unsure of their future financial security .
morale has been low , anger has been bubbling to the surface .
in a poll , conducted by an arm of insurer r + v versicherung , 52 percent of germans said they were " very afraid " of the future - up from 25 percent in 1991 .
many people think that this fearful , negative attitude is not going to get germany out of its current morass . cheer up , germany ! now a sort of national pep talk is underway , put on by publishing giant bertelsmann and 23 other companies - including publisher axel springer , newsmagazine der spiegel and broadcaster rtl germany - to lift those brooding german spirits , and hopefully the economy . " we think that about 50 percent of economic sector is psychological , so the way men and women think and behave is really important for the macroeconomic sector , " said lars cords , head of the feel-good campaign called " du bist deutschland " -lrb- " you are germany " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the " you are germany " campaign .
the four-month , 35-million-euro -lrb- $ 41 million -rrb- media campaign features billboards , magazine ads and a fairly schmaltzy two-minute tv ad featuring german celebrities and everyday folk telling people to buck up .
figure-skating champion katarina witt is there , as is national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn .
the message is : yeah , times are tough , but germany has what it takes to get back on track .
it 's the largest social campaign the country has ever seen . " the aim is a kind of jumpstart to a new spirit of optimism in germany , more confidence and motivation , " said cords .
" too many germans see the glass as half empty , and that is behavior we would like to change . " he admits that a tv campaign is not going to change ingrown habits in a few months , and nutzwerk 's ceo wonneberger says good moods can not be decreed from on high . " you ca n't really say , ' you have fun now ! '
it 's not going to work , " she admits , although some recessive prussian gene might like it to .
but others are already starting to pick up on her idea .
she 's been asked to come hold a training session on mandated good moods for a local insurance firm . she 's started her own web site for her sideline as an anti-anger trainer .
the name , translated into english , would be www.gethappy.de. wonneberger said one employee they had to let go said she could n't abide the happy atmosphere at work : " ' it 's so strange here , ' the employee always said .
that kind of attitude is what we need to change . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.11.2005 german-chinese relations at a crossroads ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and hu jintao will meet for the last time in berlin a sharp rise in bilateral trade and direct german investments in china turned the german-chinese relations under chancellor schröder into a success story .
but that could change under angela merkel . when planning his european tour , chinese president hu jintao must have expected to be introduced to the new german government in berlin .
the beginning of hu 's state visit on thursday , however , falls in the midst of drawn-out coalition negotiations , which the chinese government has been following calmly and pragmatically . " i do not believe that -lrb- germany -rrb- is in particular or unbelievable difficulties .
it is an internal question for germany .
as far as i can understand it , it does n't matter who is in power .
they -lrb- german politicians -rrb- all want to have friendly relations with us .
all of them consider a strategic relationship with china as very important , " said chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing at a recent press conference in beijing . after becoming chancellor in 1998 , gerhard schröder adopted the attitude of his predecessor , helmut kohl , who saw his country 's china policy as , above all , an economic issue .
under angela merkel , no major changes in the german-chinese relations are expected in this respect . so far , so good bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are around 20,000 chinese students at german universities both sides have reasons to be satisfied .
the international conference on renewable energies , which opened in beijing on nov .
7 , has been largely financed and co-organized by germany .
some 20,000 chinese students are studying at german universities .
bilateral trade has quadrupled since the social democrats and the green party came into power seven years ago . but professor eberhard sandschneider , a china expert from berlin , points out that a new orientation of german foreign policy under merkel may indirectly influence the relations with china . " future-chancellor angela merkel made it clear that she would make a considerable effort to improve transatlantic relations .
china has , in the meantime , become an essential point of discussion in transatlantic relations - something along the lines of : how should one deal with the rise of china in economic , but also , potentially , military matters .
it turns out that there are clear differences of opinion between washington and europe or berlin in this respect , " sandschneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angela merkel turn over a new leaf when it comes to china policy ?
the differences are particularly clear in regard to the question of lifting the eu arms embargo , which was imposed on china in 1989 after the chinese government brutally suppressed the country 's democratic movement .
when the eu started discussing lifting the embargo , washington and tokyo raised serious concerns .
and while in april 2005 gerhard schröder - resolutely , though , in the end , not successfully - pushed for the end of the embargo in a german parliamentary debate , angela merkel argued that the embargo should stay in place . a hot topic during his visit to berlin , the chinese president will most likely insist on getting rid of the arms ban .
his foreign minister li made the chinese position very clear : " the eu arms embargo is a case of political discrimination .
all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that it is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful .
this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese military potential is seen as a threat in the usa and japan it 's an unpleasant topic for the germans .
thus , presumably , government spokesman thomas steg said on monday in berlin that lifting the embargo would not figure as a prominent topic during hu jintao 's visit .
since it is a european embargo , only a unanimous decision from eu state governments can revoke the ban . human rights will hardly play a role either .
the german government refers often to the fact that the two countries have institutionalized a dialogue on constitutional state issues since 2000 .
human rights organizations , on the other hand , have called for more obvious advocacy of civil rights . end of euphoria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a human rights protester in beijing , asking for " return of my innocence " instead , berlin concentrates on economic topics .
they will be tightly interlocked with the political talks during hu jintao 's visit . and even though deals worth around 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.65 billion -rrb- are expected to be signed over the three days , there are indications that the euphoria for china that german businesspeople have expressed in the past may be running out of steam . the difficulties that german companies encounter on the chinese market - unsatisfactory protection of property , for example - are increasingly becoming a topic of discussion .
hu will be asked to address these questions not only in berlin , but also in the uk and spain . " a highly specialized company which brings an internationally leading technology on the chinese market can not be certain that this technology will not be stolen and used in a competing product , not only in china , but eventually also on our own markets , " said professor sandschneider . matthias von hein -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china and eu to tackle trade issues china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i think the bundeswehr is no longer needed .
europe seems like such a peaceful place , with quiet rides on london 's subways and romantic walks along paris 's fire-lit skies .
why would you need an army in these times ? - jfellmeth in my opinion , today especially , germany needs its bundeswehr .
it is a factor very important for good german relations with other countries . - ozael absolutely !
jawohl !
when you really find out that you need armed forces is when you do not have them .
then in an unprepared national emergency you really need them - an outside military threat or internal insurrection .
you realize that you need a military in force , in position , already trained .
not having one is an open invitation for someone to attempt to subvert the state by armed means .
germany can stand on its own .
you can not depend on others to defend you .
that is a path to disaster .
the reality is germany can only depend on itself ! - robertjewett maybe you should have a look west of the rhine for the answer as to whether germany should have a military .
one may come in handy in the coming years as the population of unassimilated young islamic militants make their bad intentions felt .
it is ironic that after all the pandering to arab opinion by european leaders - by such sordid means as defending saddam , lionizing arafat , attacking the us over it 's arab policies - arabs riot in europe while at the same time find adjusting to life in the " great satan " just fine . - petraronish one only need look at france today to understand clearly that germany still needs the military . - wbjenkins as an " auslander " i do n't think my opinions have any strength -lrb- and that is as it should be -rrb- , but i wonder .
without an army , who or what will defend germany 's interest -lrb- or way of life -rrb- ?
of course , you could go back to depending on outside help -lrb- i.e. the usa -rrb- , but i do n't think you would want that -lrb- nor would we -rrb- .
i think that germany and the rest of europe can afford to defend their interests now , but of course that would cost a lot of money and that would mean less cash for all the welfare " progress " you have made in the past 60 years . - jdmck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : debate needed on army 's future at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future .
-lrb- oct .
11 , 2005 -rrb- how two armies became one the reunification of germany in 1990 not only meant the unity of political entities .
the two german armies , once prepared to shoot at each other , had to put mistrust aside and be combined smoothly into one unit .

gmt blast-off on the first expedition to earth 's closest neighbour in over 10 years . " a perfect mission , " said jean-yves le gall , head of starsem , which was in charge of the launch , after the take-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off to venus the probe soon emitted its first signal . " the baby cried , " said jean-pierre cau of eads astrium , which built the spacecraft 's propulsion system .
" venus express has begun its operational mission . " venus express will explore the unusual stormy atmosphere and runaway global warming on venus in the hope of better understanding earth 's greenhouse-gas problem . similar , yet differe n t venus , the second planet from the sun , is similar in size , mass and age to earth but has a vastly different and ferociously hot weather system . also known as the evening star , thanks to the bright light it reflects from the sun , the planet is blanketed by thick clouds of suffocating gas driven by often hurricane-force winds and a surface pressure and temperature high enough to crush and melt lead . the planet 's clouds reflect back 80 percent of the sun 's radiation and absorb another 10 percent , leaving just 10 percent to filter down to the surface . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would it look differently on venus ?
but the clouds provide such effective insulation the surface zone becomes a pressure cooker capable of melting metal . " venus has no surface water , a toxic , heavy atmosphere made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- with clouds of sulphuric acid , and at the surface the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times that of earth at sea-level , " the esa notes . the planet 's searing surface temperature of 477 celsius -lrb- 890 fahrenheit -rrb- - the hottest in the solar system - and immense atmospheric pressure have caused many previous missions to fail or send data streams lasting only minutes before their instruments were crushed . ra n ge of tests pla n n ed it is hoped , however , that the 1.27-ton unmanned venus express orbiter will be able to use seven powerful instruments on board to map the planet 's surface and weather system , looking at temperature variation , cloud formations , wind speeds and gas composition . the craft is scheduled to arrive off venus in april , when it will be placed in an elliptical orbit , swooping to as low as 250 kilometers -lrb- 156 miles -rrb- above the surface to a height of 66,000 kilometers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars express is already on duty the orbiter , whose total mission costs are 220 million euros -lrb- $ 264 million -rrb- , has enough fuel to operate for 1,000 earth days , according to esa officials . the craft 's sister orbiter mars express is currently on a mission circling mars . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

i think the bundeswehr is no longer needed .

why would you need an army in these times ? - jfellmeth in my opinion , today especially , germany needs its bundeswehr .
it is a factor very important for good german relations with other countries . - ozael absolutely !
jawohl !
when you really find out that you need armed forces is when you do not have them .
then in an unprepared national emergency you really need them - an outside military threat or internal insurrection .
you realize that you need a military in force , in position , already trained .
not having one is an open invitation for someone to attempt to subvert the state by armed means .
germany can stand on its own .
you can not depend on others to defend you .
that is a path to disaster .
the reality is germany can only depend on itself ! - robertjewett maybe you should have a look west of the rhine for the answer as to whether germany should have a military .
one may come in handy in the coming years as the population of unassimilated young islamic militants make their bad intentions felt .
it is ironic that after all the pandering to arab opinion by european leaders - by such sordid means as defending saddam , lionizing arafat , attacking the us over it 's arab policies - arabs riot in europe while at the same time find adjusting to life in the " great satan " just fine . - petraronish one only need look at france today to understand clearly that germany still needs the military . - wbjenkins as an " auslander " i do n't think my opinions have any strength -lrb- and that is as it should be -rrb- , but i wonder .
without an army , who or what will defend germany 's interest -lrb- or way of life -rrb- ?
of course , you could go back to depending on outside help -lrb- i.e. the usa -rrb- , but i do n't think you would want that -lrb- nor would we -rrb- .
i think that germany and the rest of europe can afford to defend their interests now , but of course that would cost a lot of money and that would mean less cash for all the welfare " progress " you have made in the past 60 years . - jdmck send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : debate needed on army 's future at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future .

officials say they have found many of the city 's 122 blue badge parking spaces occupied by unauthorised vehicles during routine checks .
so now parking attendants across the city have been told to target vehicles not showing the correct permit .
in the last year 600 tickets have been issued for incorrect use of the bays .
council officials have focused on the problem after pressure from the city 's disabled advisory group .
huge impact julian horsler , the council 's equality officer , said : " abuse of blue badge disabled parking bays is a continuing issue in york .
" by parking in a designated bay without a blue badge , motorists are preventing people with severe walking difficulties being able to park close to shops , restaurants and leisure facilities .
" it can have a huge impact on their lives and there are many cases of blue badge holders being forced to turn round and go home simply because they ca n't find any where to park close enough to their destination . "
the city 's transport chiefs are urging anyone who sees someone using a blue badge bay incorrectly to call the council 's parking helpline on 0800 1381119 .

more than 500 cars had been torched by 0400 -lrb- 0300gmt -rrb- , police said .
around 200 people were arrested .
but police said the levels of violence across the country were lower than the previous night .
the northern city of amiens was the first to impose an overnight curfew under the new emergency plan .
the special decree giving local authorities and police emergency powers to deal with rioters came into force at midnight .
two paris suburbs , savigny-sur-orge and le raincy , as well as the historic city of orleans , have already declared separate curfews not covered by the law .
despite this , incidents were reported in several areas : the entire public transport network was shut down in the central-eastern city of lyon after a molotov cocktail was thrown at a train station a gas-powered bus exploded in the suburbs of the south-western city of bordeaux after it was hit by a molotov cocktail youths in the city of toulouse threw firebombs at police and set fire to cars paris , where the rioting began nearly two weeks ago , was relatively calm with some isolated cases of arson and a dozen arrests , the police said .
shortly before the decree came into effect , interior minister nicolas sarkozy , on a visit to toulouse , said police were reporting a " fairly significant fall " in violence .
state of emergency the emergency powers were approved in a special cabinet meeting earlier on tuesday .
curfew law cabinet can declare state of emergency in all or part of the country regional leaders given exceptional powers to apply curfew breach of curfew could mean two-month jail sentence police can carry out raids on suspected weapons stockpiles interior minister can issue house-arrest warrants for those deemed dangerous to public safety public meeting places can be closed down house searches possible day or night authorities can control media , film and theatre performances emergency can only be extended beyond 12 days if approved by parliament send us your views riots in pictures they allow a state of emergency to be declared in defined areas , restricting the movement of people and vehicles .
police are entitled to carry out house searches and ban public meetings .
mr sarkozy , who announced the measures , said : " the violent events that happened in our territory , and the people responsible -lsb- for the violence -rsb- will be arrested and punished " .
but some opposition parties , and the french magistrates association , have described the measures as a danger to civil liberties .
minors are subject to the law between 2200 and 0600 -lrb- 2100 and 0500 gmt -rrb- unless accompanied by an adult , and are also banned from buying petrol .
social improvements the nightly protests have gripped deprived areas where unemployment is rife and residents complain of racism and discrimination .
key flashpoints maps of the riots prime minister dominique de villepin said on tuesday the restoration of law and order in those suburbs would take time and hard work .
and he also outlined plans to improve opportunities for young people through jobs and education programmes and create an agency to combat racial discrimination .
" the republic is at a moment of truth , " he said .
" what is being questioned is the effectiveness of our integration model . "
the unrest was first sparked by the deaths in the run-down paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois of two youths , who were accidentally electrocuted at an electricity sub-station .

under the childcare bill , childminders would teach the curriculum to children " from birth " - with some worrying that it might be too prescriptive .
the national confederation of parent teacher associations called the proposals " bizarre " .
but the children 's charity i can said there was clear evidence youngsters ' communication needs were not being met .
parents ' associations spokeswoman margaret morrissey said : " we are now in danger of taking away children 's childhood when they leave the maternity ward .
" from the minute you are born and your parents go back to work , as the government has encouraged them to do , you are going to be ruled by the department for education .
" it is absolute madness . "
the proposals for the first three years of children 's development give statutory force to existing guidelines , birth to three matters , published two years ago .
those would in future cover all providers of early years care , including childminders .
they highlight four " aspects " of early learning : that children should be strong , in the sense of self-assured ; healthy ; skilful communicators who listen and respond ; and " competent learners " - imaginative and creative .
' different abilities ' tricia pritchard , from the professional association of nursery nurses -lrb- pann -rrb- , said : " we hope that this will be age-appropriate and flexible as young children develop at different rates .
" children of the same age have different abilities . "
have your say " we are not talking about sitting very young children in chairs and making them learn numbers and letters " beverley hughes children 's minister send us your comments children 's minister beverley hughes said the curriculum would indeed be flexible and " age specific " .
the bill tells childcare providers to give a mixture of " integrated care and education from birth " .

the rising jazz star held a seminar for sixth-form music students at sullivan upper school in holywood , county down on tuesday .
walking in to cheers from the students , it was clear from the start that cullum was not a typical music teacher .
" i have no plan or anything , but we 'll play some songs and try to get some of you maybe singing or playing with us , " he told them .
" if you have any questions about what it 's like to be a musician for a living , whether it 's cool or not cool , ask what you want to know . "
the 26-year-old performed a number of songs for the class and even got them to harmonise with him .
" i 'm not trying to preach to anyone , i 'm just giving them my enthusiasm for what i do and hopefully communicate it a little so they feel inspired to do it for themselves , " he said .
cullum later played a sold-out show at the waterfront in belfast music teacher gary myles said it was great to have someone like cullum in to motivate his students .
" because of who he is , they 're more likely to listen to someone like that who has made it , if you like , rather than someone coming in trying to push students in the right direction , " he said .
the marketing campaign for his latest album has targeted head girls at every all-girl school in britain , with them being sent jamie cullum promotion packs , including posters , stickers and copies of his new cd .
his record company believes the girls ' influence on friends and fellow pupils will help spread the word about cullum to a younger audience .
one of the sullivan upper students , susie elks , said she had learned a bit from the unorthodox lesson .
he became a star despite never having formal music lessons " i sing harmonies at my local church and i guess i will be bringing a little bit of what he taught to that , " she said .
cullum admitted he did not learn much about music when he was at school .
" most of the music i did was outside school , joining bands and jamming with my brother and trying to copy what i heard on the radio , " he said .
cullum had some advice for any aspiring musicians .
" i would say the most important thing is to get hold of an instrument , either at school or if you 're lucky enough to have one at home , and just muck about on it and make noise , " he said .
" do learn from people and if you can have lessons , do so , but the important thing is to just have enthusiasm and go for it - that 's what i did . "

a working party weighing the proposed change to coordinated universal time -lrb- utc -rrb- has decided more time is needed to build a consensus on the issue .
leap seconds synchronise clock time with solar time used by astronomers .
the us delegation to the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- wants to abolish these adjustments to utc .
tidal friction is causing the earth 's rotation to slow down .
this means that everyday timekeeping , based on the rotation of the earth -lrb- solar time -rrb- , tends to drift out of sync with respect to the time kept by atomic clocks .
more time for this reason , the standard for everyday timekeeping , known as coordinated universal time , or utc , must be adjusted every so often .
this takes the form of individual seconds being added or subtracted from the length of a day , either a 30 june or a 31 december .
the first leap second in seven years will be added at the end of 2005 .
in this way , clock time is kept in step with solar time , which is used to precisely point telescopes and to find satellites .
the new proposal , originally tabled for discussion at the itu meeting in geneva last wednesday , proposes that the maximum difference between utc and solar time be increased to an hour .
in a statement , the itu working party said : " the working party has discussed the proposed change and options , and decided that more time is required to build consensus .
" in addition , the forthcoming leap second just prior to 1 january 2006 provides an opportunity to further document current problems . "
welcome postponement dr mike hapgood , secretary of the royal astronomical society -lrb- ras -rrb- in the uk , welcomed the decision to defer the discussions until a later date .
" it 's what we were seeking , so that 's good from our point of view , " he told the bbc news website .
it is understood that software issues with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- sat-nav network are partly driving the proposal .
as well as satellite positioning , gps provides a time signal , and some software systems used in the sat-nav system find it hard to cope with leap seconds .
leap seconds also create difficulties for computer programmers making calculations using time .
however , without the leap second , astronomers would lose track of distant stars and spacecraft .
and the idea of clock time following solar time is also deeply embedded in contemporary culture .
researchers estimate that the difference between utc and earth time could increase to about an hour within several hundred years .
daniel gambis , of the earth rotation service in paris , which decides when to add or subtract leap seconds , told the bbc : " for me , it would be a problem if the sun were to rise at 4pm or at a different time like noon or midnight .
" i do n't support the idea of the american delegation because i think all our human activities are linked to the rotation of the earth first . "
the uk 's department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- is co-ordinating its own response to the american proposal .

a working party weighing the proposed change to coordinated universal time -lrb- utc -rrb- has decided more time is needed to build a consensus on the issue .
leap seconds synchronise clock time with solar time used by astronomers .
the us delegation to the international telecommunications union -lrb- itu -rrb- wants to abolish these adjustments to utc .
tidal friction is causing the earth 's rotation to slow down .
this means that everyday timekeeping , based on the rotation of the earth -lrb- solar time -rrb- , tends to drift out of sync with respect to the time kept by atomic clocks .
more time for this reason , the standard for everyday timekeeping , known as coordinated universal time , or utc , must be adjusted every so often .
this takes the form of individual seconds being added or subtracted from the length of a day , either a 30 june or a 31 december .
the first leap second in seven years will be added at the end of 2005 .
in this way , clock time is kept in step with solar time , which is used to precisely point telescopes and to find satellites .
the new proposal , originally tabled for discussion at the itu meeting in geneva last wednesday , proposes that the maximum difference between utc and solar time be increased to an hour .
in a statement , the itu working party said : " the working party has discussed the proposed change and options , and decided that more time is required to build consensus .
" in addition , the forthcoming leap second just prior to 1 january 2006 provides an opportunity to further document current problems . "
welcome postponement dr mike hapgood , secretary of the royal astronomical society -lrb- ras -rrb- in the uk , welcomed the decision to defer the discussions until a later date .
" it 's what we were seeking , so that 's good from our point of view , " he told the bbc news website .
it is understood that software issues with the us global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- sat-nav network are partly driving the proposal .
as well as satellite positioning , gps provides a time signal , and some software systems used in the sat-nav system find it hard to cope with leap seconds .
leap seconds also create difficulties for computer programmers making calculations using time .
however , without the leap second , astronomers would lose track of distant stars and spacecraft .
and the idea of clock time following solar time is also deeply embedded in contemporary culture .
researchers estimate that the difference between utc and earth time could increase to about an hour within several hundred years .

pre-tax profits for the six months to 30 september fell to £ 55.3m from £ 64.3m at the same time last year .
despite putting in what the firm said was a " solid performance " , the high cost of fuel added £ 13m to its bills .
firstgroup also said its rail division had fared well , despite the london bomb attacks which had had a " significant adverse impact on our rail franchises " .
passenger numbers at its first great western services - between south wales , the south west and london - were starting to recover since the attacks in july , it added .
bids in meanwhile , operating profits at its rail arm - which , with four franchises operates almost a sixth of the uk rail network - rose to £ 34.3m during the six months from £ 32.7m last year .
" this is a particularly strong performance , given the effect of the terrorist attacks on london which had a significant adverse impact on our rail franchises during the second quarter , " said the chief executive , moir lockhead .
looking ahead , the firm said it had submitted bids for the enlarged integrated kent , thameslink / great northern and greater western rail franchises .
on the bus front , firstgroup said the congestion charge had given its london bus business a fillip .
overall revenues at the division rose to £ 493.6m from £ 473m last time , however rising costs - in particular petrol prices - meant profits slipped £ 8.7m to £ 40.7m.
the company is the uk 's largest bus operator , running more than one in five local services and carrying 2.8 million passengers a day .
its us division - the second largest provider of us student transport - had delivered its " highest level of first-half revenue and earnings " with revenue rising 26 % to £ 353.3m while operating profits rose £ 3.7m to £ 19m .
