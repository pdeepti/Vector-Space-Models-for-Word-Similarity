read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .
either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concentration camp at auschwitz historians and memorial employees have already recorded exhaustive interviews with witnesses documenting daily life in the camps , the witnesses ' most important contribution to the wealth of holocaust knowledge .
sophisticated , and interactive two years ago , the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after their imprisonment .
after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .
souvenirs as a new medium memorials are also accommodating school groups by offering them the chance to stay overnight near the former camps , and spend more time studying the history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenir ideas , inspired by the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site buchenwald , near the city of weimar , embarked on a unique and controversial project last year aimed at changing the mediums through which young people are taught about the holocaust .
the memorial cooperated with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
" like any good educational process , we need to experiment , " said volkhard knigge , the buchenwald memorial director , in an interview at the time .
" otherwise we 'd freeze in this moralization " of the holocaust . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .

according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .

it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .
they also believe that fees will encourage students to study more efficiently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in front of heidelberg university " fees will help to preserve the quality of universities , " bavarian science minister thomas goppel told ap news service , adding that the money should be exclusively used to fill university coffers . he added that he supported fees of € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester .
should the court lift the ban on wednesday bavaria would try to introduce fees by the fall . no way to speed things up ? but the student fees would not come close to cover the actual university costs per student - € 8,500 annually on average .
opponents also argue that fees would make it even harder for people to study while not causing students to finish their studies faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a popular way for students to make money " studying must not become even more expensive , " said eva-maria stange , the head of germany 's academic personnel union , gew .
she added that students already had to pay € 40,000 on average for their studies .
the additional fees would force them to take on even more jobs on the side . " anyone who needs to work to cover the fees will study longer as a result , " she said . fees elsewhere while us universities have long charged tuition fees , which can climb to $ 25,000 and more at top institutions per year , other european countries have also begun charging students to help cover costs . in britain , students pay up to € 4,300 , but get discounts if they are from poor families .
the netherlands introduced fees in 1986 , austria did so in 2001 and currently charges students about € 720 per year .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .
they also believe that fees will encourage students to study more efficiently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in front of heidelberg university " fees will help to preserve the quality of universities , " bavarian science minister thomas goppel told ap news service , adding that the money should be exclusively used to fill university coffers . he added that he supported fees of € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester .
should the court lift the ban on wednesday bavaria would try to introduce fees by the fall . no way to speed things up ? but the student fees would not come close to cover the actual university costs per student - € 8,500 annually on average .
opponents also argue that fees would make it even harder for people to study while not causing students to finish their studies faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a popular way for students to make money " studying must not become even more expensive , " said eva-maria stange , the head of germany 's academic personnel union , gew .
she added that students already had to pay € 40,000 on average for their studies .
the additional fees would force them to take on even more jobs on the side . " anyone who needs to work to cover the fees will study longer as a result , " she said . fees elsewhere while us universities have long charged tuition fees , which can climb to $ 25,000 and more at top institutions per year , other european countries have also begun charging students to help cover costs . in britain , students pay up to € 4,300 , but get discounts if they are from poor families .
the netherlands introduced fees in 1986 , austria did so in 2001 and currently charges students about € 720 per year .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concentration camp at auschwitz historians and memorial employees have already recorded exhaustive interviews with witnesses documenting daily life in the camps , the witnesses ' most important contribution to the wealth of holocaust knowledge .
sophisticated , and interactive two years ago , the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after their imprisonment .
after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .
souvenirs as a new medium memorials are also accommodating school groups by offering them the chance to stay overnight near the former camps , and spend more time studying the history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenir ideas , inspired by the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site buchenwald , near the city of weimar , embarked on a unique and controversial project last year aimed at changing the mediums through which young people are taught about the holocaust .
the memorial cooperated with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
" like any good educational process , we need to experiment , " said volkhard knigge , the buchenwald memorial director , in an interview at the time .

read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .
either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu .

read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .
the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .
they also believe that fees will encourage students to study more efficiently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in front of heidelberg university " fees will help to preserve the quality of universities , " bavarian science minister thomas goppel told ap news service , adding that the money should be exclusively used to fill university coffers . he added that he supported fees of € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester .
should the court lift the ban on wednesday bavaria would try to introduce fees by the fall . no way to speed things up ? but the student fees would not come close to cover the actual university costs per student - € 8,500 annually on average .
opponents also argue that fees would make it even harder for people to study while not causing students to finish their studies faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a popular way for students to make money " studying must not become even more expensive , " said eva-maria stange , the head of germany 's academic personnel union , gew .
she added that students already had to pay € 40,000 on average for their studies .
the additional fees would force them to take on even more jobs on the side . " anyone who needs to work to cover the fees will study longer as a result , " she said . fees elsewhere while us universities have long charged tuition fees , which can climb to $ 25,000 and more at top institutions per year , other european countries have also begun charging students to help cover costs . in britain , students pay up to € 4,300 , but get discounts if they are from poor families .
the netherlands introduced fees in 1986 , austria did so in 2001 and currently charges students about € 720 per year .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .

according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .

their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .

their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 26.01.2005 why the npd should n't be silenced großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the npd have the right to freedom of speech ?
the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .

the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2005 keeping the holocaust relevant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relationship will future generations have to the holocaust ?
as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concentration camp at auschwitz historians and memorial employees have already recorded exhaustive interviews with witnesses documenting daily life in the camps , the witnesses ' most important contribution to the wealth of holocaust knowledge .
sophisticated , and interactive two years ago , the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after their imprisonment .
after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .
souvenirs as a new medium memorials are also accommodating school groups by offering them the chance to stay overnight near the former camps , and spend more time studying the history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenir ideas , inspired by the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site buchenwald , near the city of weimar , embarked on a unique and controversial project last year aimed at changing the mediums through which young people are taught about the holocaust .
the memorial cooperated with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
" like any good educational process , we need to experiment , " said volkhard knigge , the buchenwald memorial director , in an interview at the time .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "

to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .

" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .
the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .
vielen dank ! - luis iñarra dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : banning the far-right npd politicians in saxony 's state parliament made no bones about their extreme right-wing views by walking out on a commemoration of holocaust victims .
dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior .

it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .

according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2005 keeping the holocaust relevant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relationship will future generations have to the holocaust ?
as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concentration camp at auschwitz historians and memorial employees have already recorded exhaustive interviews with witnesses documenting daily life in the camps , the witnesses ' most important contribution to the wealth of holocaust knowledge .
sophisticated , and interactive two years ago , the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after their imprisonment .
after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .
souvenirs as a new medium memorials are also accommodating school groups by offering them the chance to stay overnight near the former camps , and spend more time studying the history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenir ideas , inspired by the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site buchenwald , near the city of weimar , embarked on a unique and controversial project last year aimed at changing the mediums through which young people are taught about the holocaust .
the memorial cooperated with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
" like any good educational process , we need to experiment , " said volkhard knigge , the buchenwald memorial director , in an interview at the time .
" otherwise we 'd freeze in this moralization " of the holocaust . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .

the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .

it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2005 keeping the holocaust relevant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relationship will future generations have to the holocaust ?
as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "

to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concentration camp at auschwitz historians and memorial employees have already recorded exhaustive interviews with witnesses documenting daily life in the camps , the witnesses ' most important contribution to the wealth of holocaust knowledge .
sophisticated , and interactive two years ago , the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after their imprisonment .
after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .
souvenirs as a new medium memorials are also accommodating school groups by offering them the chance to stay overnight near the former camps , and spend more time studying the history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenir ideas , inspired by the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site buchenwald , near the city of weimar , embarked on a unique and controversial project last year aimed at changing the mediums through which young people are taught about the holocaust .
the memorial cooperated with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
" like any good educational process , we need to experiment , " said volkhard knigge , the buchenwald memorial director , in an interview at the time .
" otherwise we 'd freeze in this moralization " of the holocaust . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .
either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.01.2005 sizing up us-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this way , please : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and rice during a 2004 meeting in berlin german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election . although rice has a european visit planned for early february , fischer was keen to meet with his future counterpart before she officially takes her post . it was not only be the first meeting between the two since president bush 's re-election but also the first german-us get-together since then ; a chance for both sides to test diplomatic waters which have been choppy and difficult to navigate for some time . bush has been making almost conciliatory noises in regards to europe in the months since his november success and fischer 's arrival in the us capital will be used by the germans to gauge how far they can expect the transatlantic healing to go at the start of the bush administration 's second term . " i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .
either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 26.01.2005 why the npd should n't be silenced großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the npd have the right to freedom of speech ?
the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .

in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .
the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .
vielen dank ! - luis iñarra dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : banning the far-right npd politicians in saxony 's state parliament made no bones about their extreme right-wing views by walking out on a commemoration of holocaust victims .
dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior .

it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .
they also believe that fees will encourage students to study more efficiently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in front of heidelberg university " fees will help to preserve the quality of universities , " bavarian science minister thomas goppel told ap news service , adding that the money should be exclusively used to fill university coffers . he added that he supported fees of € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester .
should the court lift the ban on wednesday bavaria would try to introduce fees by the fall . no way to speed things up ? but the student fees would not come close to cover the actual university costs per student - € 8,500 annually on average .
opponents also argue that fees would make it even harder for people to study while not causing students to finish their studies faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a popular way for students to make money " studying must not become even more expensive , " said eva-maria stange , the head of germany 's academic personnel union , gew .
she added that students already had to pay € 40,000 on average for their studies .
the additional fees would force them to take on even more jobs on the side . " anyone who needs to work to cover the fees will study longer as a result , " she said . fees elsewhere while us universities have long charged tuition fees , which can climb to $ 25,000 and more at top institutions per year , other european countries have also begun charging students to help cover costs . in britain , students pay up to € 4,300 , but get discounts if they are from poor families .
the netherlands introduced fees in 1986 , austria did so in 2001 and currently charges students about € 720 per year .
nordic countries meanwhile still pay their students several hundred euros per month . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's school of hard knocks germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2005 eu banana skin awaits fruit growers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2006 , europeans will have to pay more to enjoy the banana germany 's fruit traders are finding it tough to swallow a new eu directive which could see duties on the popular banana rise threefold by next year . germany is a banana republic .
within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concentration camp at auschwitz historians and memorial employees have already recorded exhaustive interviews with witnesses documenting daily life in the camps , the witnesses ' most important contribution to the wealth of holocaust knowledge .
sophisticated , and interactive two years ago , the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after their imprisonment .
after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .
souvenirs as a new medium memorials are also accommodating school groups by offering them the chance to stay overnight near the former camps , and spend more time studying the history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenir ideas , inspired by the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site buchenwald , near the city of weimar , embarked on a unique and controversial project last year aimed at changing the mediums through which young people are taught about the holocaust .

only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .

after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .
they also believe that fees will encourage students to study more efficiently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in front of heidelberg university " fees will help to preserve the quality of universities , " bavarian science minister thomas goppel told ap news service , adding that the money should be exclusively used to fill university coffers . he added that he supported fees of € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester .
should the court lift the ban on wednesday bavaria would try to introduce fees by the fall . no way to speed things up ? but the student fees would not come close to cover the actual university costs per student - € 8,500 annually on average .
opponents also argue that fees would make it even harder for people to study while not causing students to finish their studies faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a popular way for students to make money " studying must not become even more expensive , " said eva-maria stange , the head of germany 's academic personnel union , gew .
she added that students already had to pay € 40,000 on average for their studies .
the additional fees would force them to take on even more jobs on the side . " anyone who needs to work to cover the fees will study longer as a result , " she said . fees elsewhere while us universities have long charged tuition fees , which can climb to $ 25,000 and more at top institutions per year , other european countries have also begun charging students to help cover costs . in britain , students pay up to € 4,300 , but get discounts if they are from poor families .
the netherlands introduced fees in 1986 , austria did so in 2001 and currently charges students about € 720 per year .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concentration camp at auschwitz historians and memorial employees have already recorded exhaustive interviews with witnesses documenting daily life in the camps , the witnesses ' most important contribution to the wealth of holocaust knowledge .
sophisticated , and interactive two years ago , the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after their imprisonment .
after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .
souvenirs as a new medium memorials are also accommodating school groups by offering them the chance to stay overnight near the former camps , and spend more time studying the history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenir ideas , inspired by the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site buchenwald , near the city of weimar , embarked on a unique and controversial project last year aimed at changing the mediums through which young people are taught about the holocaust .
the memorial cooperated with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
" like any good educational process , we need to experiment , " said volkhard knigge , the buchenwald memorial director , in an interview at the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2005 eu banana skin awaits fruit growers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2006 , europeans will have to pay more to enjoy the banana germany 's fruit traders are finding it tough to swallow a new eu directive which could see duties on the popular banana rise threefold by next year . germany is a banana republic .
within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2005 eu banana skin awaits fruit growers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2006 , europeans will have to pay more to enjoy the banana germany 's fruit traders are finding it tough to swallow a new eu directive which could see duties on the popular banana rise threefold by next year . germany is a banana republic .
within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

but trade with the eu is lagging .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .

their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 26.01.2005 why the npd should n't be silenced großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the npd have the right to freedom of speech ?
the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .
the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .

read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .
either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .
they also believe that fees will encourage students to study more efficiently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in front of heidelberg university " fees will help to preserve the quality of universities , " bavarian science minister thomas goppel told ap news service , adding that the money should be exclusively used to fill university coffers . he added that he supported fees of € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester .
should the court lift the ban on wednesday bavaria would try to introduce fees by the fall . no way to speed things up ? but the student fees would not come close to cover the actual university costs per student - € 8,500 annually on average .
opponents also argue that fees would make it even harder for people to study while not causing students to finish their studies faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a popular way for students to make money " studying must not become even more expensive , " said eva-maria stange , the head of germany 's academic personnel union , gew .
she added that students already had to pay € 40,000 on average for their studies .
the additional fees would force them to take on even more jobs on the side . " anyone who needs to work to cover the fees will study longer as a result , " she said . fees elsewhere while us universities have long charged tuition fees , which can climb to $ 25,000 and more at top institutions per year , other european countries have also begun charging students to help cover costs . in britain , students pay up to € 4,300 , but get discounts if they are from poor families .
the netherlands introduced fees in 1986 , austria did so in 2001 and currently charges students about € 720 per year .
nordic countries meanwhile still pay their students several hundred euros per month . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's school of hard knocks germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .
either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .
they also believe that fees will encourage students to study more efficiently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in front of heidelberg university " fees will help to preserve the quality of universities , " bavarian science minister thomas goppel told ap news service , adding that the money should be exclusively used to fill university coffers . he added that he supported fees of € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester .
should the court lift the ban on wednesday bavaria would try to introduce fees by the fall . no way to speed things up ? but the student fees would not come close to cover the actual university costs per student - € 8,500 annually on average .
opponents also argue that fees would make it even harder for people to study while not causing students to finish their studies faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a popular way for students to make money " studying must not become even more expensive , " said eva-maria stange , the head of germany 's academic personnel union , gew .
she added that students already had to pay € 40,000 on average for their studies .
the additional fees would force them to take on even more jobs on the side . " anyone who needs to work to cover the fees will study longer as a result , " she said . fees elsewhere while us universities have long charged tuition fees , which can climb to $ 25,000 and more at top institutions per year , other european countries have also begun charging students to help cover costs . in britain , students pay up to € 4,300 , but get discounts if they are from poor families .
the netherlands introduced fees in 1986 , austria did so in 2001 and currently charges students about € 720 per year .
nordic countries meanwhile still pay their students several hundred euros per month . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's school of hard knocks germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .

to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .

" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.01.2005 making civil servants more ... civil großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration offices : not the most welcoming side of germany in 2002 , germany 's venerable humboldt foundation introduced an award for the country 's " friendliest immigration office . "
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .

read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .
either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .
they also believe that fees will encourage students to study more efficiently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in front of heidelberg university " fees will help to preserve the quality of universities , " bavarian science minister thomas goppel told ap news service , adding that the money should be exclusively used to fill university coffers . he added that he supported fees of € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester .
should the court lift the ban on wednesday bavaria would try to introduce fees by the fall . no way to speed things up ? but the student fees would not come close to cover the actual university costs per student - € 8,500 annually on average .
opponents also argue that fees would make it even harder for people to study while not causing students to finish their studies faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a popular way for students to make money " studying must not become even more expensive , " said eva-maria stange , the head of germany 's academic personnel union , gew .
she added that students already had to pay € 40,000 on average for their studies .
the additional fees would force them to take on even more jobs on the side . " anyone who needs to work to cover the fees will study longer as a result , " she said . fees elsewhere while us universities have long charged tuition fees , which can climb to $ 25,000 and more at top institutions per year , other european countries have also begun charging students to help cover costs . in britain , students pay up to € 4,300 , but get discounts if they are from poor families .
the netherlands introduced fees in 1986 , austria did so in 2001 and currently charges students about € 720 per year .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.01.2005 sizing up us-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this way , please : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and rice during a 2004 meeting in berlin german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election . although rice has a european visit planned for early february , fischer was keen to meet with his future counterpart before she officially takes her post . it was not only be the first meeting between the two since president bush 's re-election but also the first german-us get-together since then ; a chance for both sides to test diplomatic waters which have been choppy and difficult to navigate for some time . bush has been making almost conciliatory noises in regards to europe in the months since his november success and fischer 's arrival in the us capital will be used by the germans to gauge how far they can expect the transatlantic healing to go at the start of the bush administration 's second term . " i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 26.01.2005 no more junk food on tv großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are especially vulnerable to junk food advertising an initiative put forth by the european commission to ban junk food ads on television has meet with approval from several dw-world readers .
read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .
either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .

the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.01.2005 making civil servants more ... civil großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration offices : not the most welcoming side of germany in 2002 , germany 's venerable humboldt foundation introduced an award for the country 's " friendliest immigration office . "
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .

but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 26.01.2005 why the npd should n't be silenced großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the npd have the right to freedom of speech ?
the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .

according to reports in the süddeutsche zeitung , schily plans to forbid neo-nazi demonstrations at places that " remember the victims of organized , inhumane treatment , and which are seen as national symbols for such treatment . "
the greens ' expert for interior affairs said her party rejected any changes to the existing laws on the right of assembly , and added that the far right npd party should not be given the power to restrict this freedom for any other group .
the head of the parliamentary internal affairs committee , cornelie sonntag-wolgast -lrb- spd -rrb- , reacted similarly , saying that the right to demonstrate was added to the german constitution because of the restrictions that were in place under the nazi regime .
she added that the current debate about how to deal with the provocation posed by the npd should not be compressed into a debate on altering laws . dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .

their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .

but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .

their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

according to reports in the süddeutsche zeitung , schily plans to forbid neo-nazi demonstrations at places that " remember the victims of organized , inhumane treatment , and which are seen as national symbols for such treatment . "
the greens ' expert for interior affairs said her party rejected any changes to the existing laws on the right of assembly , and added that the far right npd party should not be given the power to restrict this freedom for any other group .
the head of the parliamentary internal affairs committee , cornelie sonntag-wolgast -lrb- spd -rrb- , reacted similarly , saying that the right to demonstrate was added to the german constitution because of the restrictions that were in place under the nazi regime .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "

to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .

after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .

currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .

the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .

within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .

their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.01.2005 sizing up us-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this way , please : fischer -lrb- left -rrb- and rice during a 2004 meeting in berlin german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election . although rice has a european visit planned for early february , fischer was keen to meet with his future counterpart before she officially takes her post . it was not only be the first meeting between the two since president bush 's re-election but also the first german-us get-together since then ; a chance for both sides to test diplomatic waters which have been choppy and difficult to navigate for some time . bush has been making almost conciliatory noises in regards to europe in the months since his november success and fischer 's arrival in the us capital will be used by the germans to gauge how far they can expect the transatlantic healing to go at the start of the bush administration 's second term . " i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
how the two foreign ministers get on personally and professionally in those months could be very important to those and future outcomes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany upbeat , france cautious on rice german foreign minister joschka fischer tuesday had praise for us national security advisor condoleezza rice , who has been nominated to be the next secretary of state .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .
the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .
the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .
the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .

read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .
either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2005 eu banana skin awaits fruit growers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of 2006 , europeans will have to pay more to enjoy the banana germany 's fruit traders are finding it tough to swallow a new eu directive which could see duties on the popular banana rise threefold by next year . germany is a banana republic .
within the eu , which is the largest importer of bananas worldwide , over 1.1 million tons end up in germany .
the country leads in consumption of the tropical yellow fruits .
in 2003 , germans ate 17.7 kilograms of bananas per household .
only the teacher 's favorite , the apple , is more popular .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : companies like chiquita depend on cheap bananas - new duties may increase price significantly the popularity of bananas is n't hard to explain . they are healthy .
their color and taste remind us in freezing winter that there are places out there that are sunny all year round .
bananas are endowed with a naturally practical packaging , ensuring you do n't make a mess . plus , they have an ample supply of serotonin , a hormone which puts us in a good mood .
but german fruit companies are afraid the euphoria surrounding the banana could soon evaporate .
with the european commission recommending raising duties on bananas from countries outside the eu to € 230 -lrb- $ 298 -rrb- per ton by 2006 , there is fear that prices could spiral .
calculations not correct representatives from the german fruit retail association -lrb- dfhv -rrb- had a bitter taste in their mouths when they heard the announcement .
according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .

the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .

according to the dfhv , the european commission made their duty recommendation of € 230 per ton on bananas as of 2006 based on wrong price statistics .
" the calculation of the duty is based on wrong numbers , " said ulrich boysen , head of the dfhv .
he said that the numbers the commission used were simply a false sample of data .
the european commission had come up with a price of € 890 per ton . the dfhv 's calculations lie at under € 700 per ton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bananas from latin america , here colombia , are immensely popular in germany - mainly due to the low price the result will be a higher customs duty on the banana .
but to understand how the commission reached its decision one has to understand the complicated duties system of the eu .
it starts with the fact that european banana producers are subject to competition from so-called cheap " dollar " bananas outside the eu .
in order to protect the eu farmers , a complex set of quotas was implemented .
currently , eu fruit retailers import over 3 million tons of bananas annually .
the duty stands at 75 euros / ton .
beginning in 2006 however , the eu wants to simplify the importation .
the quota system will be dropped in favor of a straight-forward customs duty .
this was the result of an agreement ecuador , one of the world 's biggest banana exporters , made with the us and the eu .
this new duty will be markedly higher and german retailers are worried that the bendy tropical wonder will lose its appeal .
the future of the banana bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the canary islands are one of the main regions to grow the tropical fruit in europe european banana producers do not have it easy against their cheaper competitors from latin america .
their wares are currently protected but the banana is still a good bargain .
if the customs duties are tripled like the european commission suggests they should be , it will be the consumer who will have to dig deeper into his pocket - and possibly decide to buy fewer bananas .
the fruit retailers may just be suffering from a case of sour grapes .
on the other hand , consumers may just decide to purchase more grapes - or oranges , or pineapples in the future .
this should equally satisfy the fruit retailers . marco stoffel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin america aims for more eu trade gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "

to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .

after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "

to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .

" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .
they also believe that fees will encourage students to study more efficiently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in front of heidelberg university " fees will help to preserve the quality of universities , " bavarian science minister thomas goppel told ap news service , adding that the money should be exclusively used to fill university coffers . he added that he supported fees of € 500 -lrb- $ 650 -rrb- per semester .
should the court lift the ban on wednesday bavaria would try to introduce fees by the fall . no way to speed things up ? but the student fees would not come close to cover the actual university costs per student - € 8,500 annually on average .
opponents also argue that fees would make it even harder for people to study while not causing students to finish their studies faster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a popular way for students to make money " studying must not become even more expensive , " said eva-maria stange , the head of germany 's academic personnel union , gew .
she added that students already had to pay € 40,000 on average for their studies .
the additional fees would force them to take on even more jobs on the side . " anyone who needs to work to cover the fees will study longer as a result , " she said . fees elsewhere while us universities have long charged tuition fees , which can climb to $ 25,000 and more at top institutions per year , other european countries have also begun charging students to help cover costs . in britain , students pay up to € 4,300 , but get discounts if they are from poor families .
the netherlands introduced fees in 1986 , austria did so in 2001 and currently charges students about € 720 per year .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .

with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .

" i think if we can take a step nearer in the diplomacy between europe and the united states , then that is an important step , " fischer said before leaving for the meeting with rice . iraq and iran still need negotiating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the old stumbling blocks are still there .
as foreign ministers , fischer and rice will have the iraq debate to chew over .
on tuesday , fischer made it clear that he did not believe europe and germany had to offer more financial help for iraq , pointing out the " significant material support " germany was already offering to stabilize the country . another issue in coming months will be the increasingly important iran factor .
with europe continuing to promote diplomacy with tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions and with rice an advocate of a harder line than the one taken by her predecessor , colin powell , over iran , the pitfalls that so nearly damaged german-us relations beyond repair in the recent past will be there to navigate all over again . fischer has a strong hand when it comes to iran .
he was part of the three-way diplomatic team of german , british and french foreign ministers that managed to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment and to continue diplomatic relations . " europe and the us have to work hard to find a successful diplomatic solution , " fischer told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with rice . bush loyalist rice walks the hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is concerned over us policy towards iran and has maiantained diplomatic ties .
however , rice likely made it very clear that such assurances from iran mean little to the bush administration without hard facts to back them up .
with rumors of a military option being considered by the us , fischer will need more than a promise to convince the americans that the europeans can handle iran . the meeting also gave the two ministers the chance to assess each other personally .
fischer enjoyed a relaxed and respectful relationship with powell , the highest ranking moderate in the administration at the time of holding office . rice , as a staunch supporter and confidante of the president , shared the distrust of the germans during the build-up to the iraq war and will carry a harder line into any future negotiations than powell .
while nothing can be predicted , less cordial meetings than before are a possibility . much to lose , much to gain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice will test the european waters before president bush arrives a few weeks later .
rice will return the transatlantic favor by dipping her toe into the european arena in february , just a few weeks before her boss does the same .
it is expected that she will smooth the way for the president by meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder ahead of bush 's own summit with the german leader at the end of next month . both have much to lose and gain in the next tentative months .
rice will hope to ease tensions between the two nations in a bid to bring germany back into the fold of useful allies , while fischer will be looking to gain support for germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council .

"
it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .
" in wismar , say , you can create a more personal environment than in frankfurt , where hundreds of people are standing in line . " one condition of the award is that the authorities submit a detailed plan outlining how the funds would be spent .
according to frühwald , municipalities often pledge to provide further financial aid if the immigration office manages to win the prize , which suggests the humboldt foundation 's scheme has served as a successful leg-up to better treatment from the local authorities - helping to tackle both the problem 's symptoms and causes . " in three years , the award has made people aware that dedicated immigration offices contribute to a positive image of germany which helps attract the best international researchers and students to germany , " frühwald said . now that the foreign students have been taken care of , the next step will be improving the treatment of all the other applicants . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german greencarders live life in limbo the german government 's green card program brought thousands of foreign it experts to work in the country for five-year stints , but for many their status remains dubious and life in limbo is not getting easier . -lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . -lrb- january 18 , 2005 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .

it 's about to be issued for the third and last time .
the burning question is : did it help ? berlin is hosting a somewhat double-edged award ceremony on wednesday .
in an ideal world , this prize should n't really have to exist .
but unfortunately for germany 's thousands of would-be immigrants , long-term visitors and even guest academics , the nation 's civil servants appear to need a little more motivation than a mere " employee of the month " contest . hence the " germany 's friendliest immigration office " award - a prize that has , apparently , ushered in a new climate of healthy competition among paper shufflers . not surprisingly , it was a project dreamt up by a collection of the country 's finest minds , the humboldt foundation , a non-profit scheme for the promotion of international research cooperation .
it enables highly qualified scholars not resident in germany to spend extended periods of research in the country . being nice pays three years ago , the foundation realized that sometimes money talks - and if it ca n't actually buy you a residence permit , it can at least buy a gentle rejection rather than a barked refusal and a door slammed in the face . " five years ago , one in six of the reports we were getting from our scholars referred to the problem of xenophobia in germany , " wolfgang frühwald , the president of the humboldt foundation , told dw-radio .
" we were extremely alarmed to hear that so many of our young colleagues had encountered this sort of problem . " the annual three prizes for " germany 's friendliest immigration office " are worth a hefty € 25,000 each .
if that is n't enough to put a twinkle in the eye of the notoriously sour-faced staff manning the dingy desks at the country 's most dreaded bureaucratic institutes , then the humboldt foundation 's project has all been in vain . but according to frühwald , the financial incentive has proved highly effective , even though he 's quick to point out that the award was only offered to departments responsible for student registration .
and compared to the routine hostility dispensed to applicants from developing countries , academics seeking restricted residence permits in germany are given red-carpet treatment . and the winner is ... the latest recipients of the award are offices in leipzig , aalen and düren .
improvements include children 's corners , readily-available information leaflets and a more efficient , digitalized system that reduces waiting time .
friendly , flexible and cooperative staff are further plus points , with positive personal interaction cited as a major advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's hardest for the largest registration offices , for example in berlin , frankfurt and munich , which have huge turnovers " frühwald said .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .
the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .

read what they say . junk food is one of the most insidious evils that face the planet today .
how many dreams are lost ?
how many lives left unfulfilled because people do not have the health and vitality to pursue what means most to them ?
please be an example to america and establish that a healthy people are a happy people and a strong country . - jonathan burgess go ahead and ban junk food ads that target children , but there have to be other reasons for obesity .
it appears that the investigations into obesity are focussed entirely upon the intake of fat , sugar , salt and exercise level .
maybe there are other reasons .
is there something in today 's foods that slows down metabolism ?
why not make comparison studies of individuals on the same diet that have large differences in weight .
i know a number of fat people who deserve to be skinny .
let 's think outside the fat , sugar , salt , exercise box . – steve roberts , canada in the us , we have sacrificed the current and future health of our children on the alter of free enterprise and free speech .
we allowed companies like mcdonalds to use images of clowns and cartoon characters to lure our children to consume fat and sugar laden foods designed to minimize cost and maximize sales .
this food is no different than alcohol or tobacco and should not be marketed to children .
the long term health effects in terms of obesity and the effect of eating habits on nutrition are matters that must be taken very seriously .
the european countries i have had the pleasure of visiting still seem to have a culture of family meal time accompanied by carefully prepared meals . proliferation of fast food and the accompanying temptation to take the easy way out will destroy this culture .
it may already be too late for the us . europe may still have a chance to stop this scourge . - tim morris , us i think banning junk food ads to children during prime viewing / listening hours is a very good thing . i hope that the eu will manage to do this .
perhaps your example will then help us to at least diminish this type of advertising in the us . – anne lewis , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no doubt about it : children love sweets i am 100 percent for banning junk food ads .
children are the no. 1 place to stop obesity , but we as adults need to improve also what we take in .
someone told me that the kids won ’ t eat if i don ’ t buy this and that . well that sounds like the kids are in control of the food intake and that the children are controlled from advertisement .
what the house supplies and the way adults eat will in turn teach and help our children to eat better and make wiser choices of the food they eat .
someone told me if we stick to the outside isle of a store the major healthy choices are there and the inner isles are the chips and pop .
vending machines are another bad invention because all you must do is drop a coin in and the junk food is given to you .
they should also be banned from schools and work places and put a kitchen in work places and each week it would be one worker ’ s responsibility to prepare a healthy lunch for the crew instead of tv dinners and all the quick meals available to through in the microwave . - patrick emrich , canada i am happy that the eu is considering the banishment of fast food advertising targeted at children .
i hope that countries in europe do not allow lobbyists and industry money to cause legislators to " look the other way " while the population becomes subjected to a barrage of advertising for junk foods , junk drugs and an overall " junk life , " like we have been subjected to in the usa .
unfortunately , our us government officials have become addicted to the large sums of money they receive from various industry " trade groups " and are no longer able to legislate " for the good of the people " .
europe : please do not become another america .
instead , learn from our mistakes . - nick mancini , born in italy , now living in california , usa it is a good step but the experts should work on ways to introduce a policy that eliminates diabetes and other complications related to sugar in food that ultimately leads to obesity and related complications .
a ban on ads is a good first step .
schools would do well to introduce physical education and its importance . - rzwan ghani initially i thought the idea of banning junk food ads targeting children would be a good idea .
but who feeds them ?
who buys it and provides it , and is ultimately responsible for allowing them to eat the junk food - parents , schools , relatives , friends , etc . ?
it has permeated every age group - not only children .
banning ads is a cheap band-aid fix .
more drastic measures are needed .
go directly to the source : demand , educate , regulate and produce better food instead .
require food producers to meet these new standards . - pm puljic send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers banning junk food ads in a bid to tackle europe ’ s growing obesity problem , brussels has warned food companies to stop advertising junk food to children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2005 keeping the holocaust relevant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relationship will future generations have to the holocaust ?
as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concentration camp at auschwitz historians and memorial employees have already recorded exhaustive interviews with witnesses documenting daily life in the camps , the witnesses ' most important contribution to the wealth of holocaust knowledge .
sophisticated , and interactive two years ago , the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after their imprisonment .
after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .
souvenirs as a new medium memorials are also accommodating school groups by offering them the chance to stay overnight near the former camps , and spend more time studying the history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenir ideas , inspired by the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site buchenwald , near the city of weimar , embarked on a unique and controversial project last year aimed at changing the mediums through which young people are taught about the holocaust .
the memorial cooperated with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
" like any good educational process , we need to experiment , " said volkhard knigge , the buchenwald memorial director , in an interview at the time .
" otherwise we 'd freeze in this moralization " of the holocaust . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

the far-right national democratic party 's behavior at a recent memorial ceremony for holocaust victims prompted many to ask why the party is n't banned .
but most of dw 's readers felt the npd has a right to a voice . i think that the npd should not be banned .
their party has just as much right to voice their beliefs as the greens , cdu and the spd .
how long are people going to label the germans nazis ?
that was 60 years ago .
this is a different age now .
these people just want jobs for germans , their social money to go to germans and not " ausländer " .
some might view their comments differently , but behind closed doors i 'll bet it is a different story . - michael fuller / usa the npd should not be banned as a party unless they are a viable threat to overthrow the german government by violent means rather than through the election process .
they have the right to freedom of speech .
in a constitutional democracy , who would be entitled to decide to ban the party short of an amendment to the consitution through the means set up for that process ? - john thomas trends in many eu countries illustrate that far-right parties are here to stay and npd / cvu could gather enough votes in 2006 to enter the bundestag .
the german unemployment rate is increasing and government reforms are highly unpopular .
i think the increasing pessimism in the public about the state of the economy will give the npd / dvu more votes .
however , the most effective way to oppose these far-right groups is not through left-wing violence .
the federal and state governments should work actively to improve the economical condition of germany and initiate more actions for multicultural harmony .
the npd / dvu hate of non-germans is a tragic result of an ignorant ideology . - atilla a. iftikhar it may come as a shock but in a true democracy even unpopular speech is protected . if only " correct " speech is free then you do not have freedom of speech .
one would think this principle would by now be fundamental in a free society . - jl ronish npd should not be banned yet , however if their policy and rhetoric worsen then the party should be banned from all states .
it is possible they will encourage more hate and even violence against people they consider " un-patriotic " .
such intimidations could lead to physical assaults by npd supporters which can not be tolerated by the government .
the neo-nazis and other extremists propagating hate and violence should not be tolerated by the society .
unfortunately , it seems considerable supporters in the former east enjoy such political parties . - atilla a iftikhar i 've just returned from iraq .
the us , my country , claims it is building democracy there . is this conceivable ? people point to germany and japan as successes . does germany have a democracy ? a year or two ago your parliament expelled a syrian member for comparing israelis to nazis in treatment of subject peoples . now this npd speaker in the saxony parliament has his microphone turned off for calling the bombing of dresden mass-murder by anglo-american gangsters . and his party is under banning threat .
is that democracy ? my theory of democracy is that it grows from inside a community , indeed is the growth of community as people learn to trust each other .
did the " allied " foster-fathers of the german nation only delay germany 's development of democracy by imposing a democratic constitution ? what do germans think ? - chris rushlau after reading the article , the only thing i can say is that silvana koch-merin , markus soeder , michael muller and christina weiss will be out of work .
at least a new generation of politicians will take care of the german interests , instead of somebody else 's .
the construction of so many foreign memorials , with any excuse , is appalling and a way to try to form the wrong idea in the german people before the general elections .

the constitutional court became involved in the matter after six states led by conservative governments appealed to judges to review a ban on fees imposed by the federal government in 2002 . those in support of student fees have said the extra money is needed to cover the rising cost of universities while state governments lack funds .

as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations . in an interview with the german magazine der spiegel this week , accomplished cellist and auschwitz survivor anita lasker-wallfisch expressed concern about the holocaust education of today 's youth .
" i am a bit nervous about overfeeding the youth , " said lasker-wallfisch , who moved to london after the war .
" in germany , there are almost always television programs on about the holcaust .
that can sometimes be too much for the young people . "
for decades , holocaust survivors like lasker-wallfisch were considered the most effective way to pass on the somber lessons of the time to coming generations .
more than documentaries , history lessons , or tours of concentration camp memorials , survivors , and the painfully personal stories they told connected with schoolchildren without " overfeeding " them , holocaust educators said .
what happens when they 're gone ?
sixty years after the liberation of the death camps , the generation of survivors is passing away , presenting holocaust scholars and educators with a unique challenge .
" that the witnesses are irreplaceable is clear to everyone , " said horst seferens , spokesman for the concentration camp memorials in sachsenhausen and ravensbrück .
" the absence of those witnesses also cuts deeply into our own work .
they are the most authentic source of information for students . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer in front of a violated memorial for killed inmates of the nazi concentration camps sachsenhausen and ravensbrück at a time in europe when english princes are wearing nazi uniforms at costume parties and jewish groups are sounding alarm at an increase in anti-semitism , the need to sensitize current and coming generations is obvious .
to do that in way that does n't alienate young germans , or blame them in any way , has been one of the country 's most difficult challenges .
stepping on toes politicians " tend to see this part of history as very important , out of consideration for political correctness , " said thomas lutz , head of the memorial museums department at the topography of terror foundation in berlin .
" we see that as more of a hindrance as a help because we notice that the youth are worried about asking the wrong questions .
they have to first overcome this fear . "
in recent years , the network of more than 30 holocaust memorials in northern and central europe has been working on ways to connect with future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the concentration camp at auschwitz historians and memorial employees have already recorded exhaustive interviews with witnesses documenting daily life in the camps , the witnesses ' most important contribution to the wealth of holocaust knowledge .
sophisticated , and interactive two years ago , the sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial in the eastern german state of brandenburg put together a cd-rom featuring profiles of 20 prisoners at the camp and their lives before , during and after their imprisonment .
after the state school system began using it , the federal ministry in charge of education adopted the disc .
" the cd does a good job of bringing -lrb- the experience -rrb- closer , " seferens said .
across germany , visitor centers at memorials have gotten more sophisticated and interactive while the people who work there have become more qualified for the job .
" the memorials are making more of an effort to address the individual needs of the visitors , " lutz said .
souvenirs as a new medium memorials are also accommodating school groups by offering them the chance to stay overnight near the former camps , and spend more time studying the history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the souvenir ideas , inspired by the thousands of buttons unearthed on the site buchenwald , near the city of weimar , embarked on a unique and controversial project last year aimed at changing the mediums through which young people are taught about the holocaust .
the memorial cooperated with design students at the local bauhaus university to come up with souvenirs that visitors could take with them .
" like any good educational process , we need to experiment , " said volkhard knigge , the buchenwald memorial director , in an interview at the time .

cumbria tourist board officials claim building 27 turbines at whinash , stretching 7km to the yorkshire dales , would create a " dangerous precedent . "
its 2,000 members have formally agreed to object to the plans when the controversial move is debated at a public inquiry in april this year .
members believe the area 's landscape would be spoilt by huge turbine blades .
renewable development company and west coast energy want to build the turbines , each almost 400ft high , to generate enough power for 46,000 homes .
' harm tourism ' eric robson , chairman of cumbria tourist board , said : " the application would see turbines - each higher than st paul 's cathedral - go up on a narrow strip of land between two national parks .
" we are not opposed to renewable energy in principle , but we feel the farm would be visible from the m6 motorway which is the gateway to the lake district and could harm tourism - the county 's biggest industry .
" tourism is worth a billion pounds to cumbria every year , yet the view would be dominated by the constant movement of turbine blades . "
the £ 55m plan would involve turbines being spread between tebay and shap overlooking the m6 , and would generate 57 megawatts of electricity .
renewable development company and west coast energy have said they have consulted a number of environmental groups in the run-up to submitting plans .

up to 177,000 women set up businesses in the uk in 2004 according to a report published by the mayor of london , on average women in the city earn 25 % less than men , compared with 18 % less across the uk .
the women in london 's economy report also revealed that women are less likely to be in employment than men in london and even women elsewhere in britain .
another report published last week by the london business school revealed that 177,000 more women set up businesses in uk in the past year - closing the gap between the number of male and female entrepreneurs .
dianah worman , diversity advisor from the chartered institute of personnel and development , said : " whilst work practices have drastically changed over the years , some board members appear to be stuck in the 19th century .
glenda stone says not enough women are in high-paying jobs " they must change their image , of an old boys ' club , and start representing the present workforce . "
glenda stone , chief executive of london-based aurora , a network of 20,000 entrepreneurial women in britain , suggests it is largely as a result of this gender pay gap that many women decide to start their own businesses .
" there is a huge gender segregation in the labour force , " she said .
" the reason for this is mainly because women are still in lower paid jobs such as child care , cleaning and secretarial work .
website research " there are not enough women in the higher paying sectors such as finance , law and it . "
in order to ensure that women achieve both equal pay and rights at work , aurora launched the wherewomenwanttowork.com website .
this allows them to research companies which provide evidence women are paid equally and are offered the same opportunities as men .
but for some women this is not enough and more and more are looking to be their own bosses .
women use networks for development rather than survival but as well as setting up businesses , women are also challenging the old boys ' clubs and coming together to form their own women-only support networks .
sister snog , a members-only , events-based networking club exclusively for london businesswomen , was launched in may last year by annie brooks and hela wozniak-kay .
ms wozniak-kay said : " when annie and i decided to formally establish sister snog , we did n't want to be just another networking club .
" we wanted to have our own individuality .
we wanted to be the only sister snog , hence the originality in our name . "
network change the group holds business breakfasts , lunches and dinners at exclusive venues in central london .
there are now more than 100 women 's networking groups in london .
some corporate networks exist for women within one company or workplace , such as women working in certain city banks , whilst others operate as industry or cross-industry groups , such as women in engineering or journalism .
but the purpose of the women 's network appears to have changed .
in this modern fast-paced world that we live in it is ridiculous that the gap between how much men and women earn is huge aurora 's glenda stone whereas 20 years ago it was more about survival , most women 's networks now appear to be mainly for professional development .
but the gender pay gap is still evident .
in order to address this , the government 's women and equality unit has introduced a number of measures including making it easier for women and men to take up equal pay claims by simplifying and speeding up existing tribunal procedures .
later this year a women and work commission , created last july to examine the problems of the gender pay gap and other issues affecting women 's employment , will report to the prime minister .
' future is bleak ' according to the women in london 's economy report london 's output would be raised by almost £ 1.5bn-a-year if the proportion of women with dependent children in the city in part-time employment was raised to the average national level .

up to 177,000 women set up businesses in the uk in 2004 according to a report published by the mayor of london , on average women in the city earn 25 % less than men , compared with 18 % less across the uk .
the women in london 's economy report also revealed that women are less likely to be in employment than men in london and even women elsewhere in britain .
another report published last week by the london business school revealed that 177,000 more women set up businesses in uk in the past year - closing the gap between the number of male and female entrepreneurs .

tashi phuntsog , who was released earlier this month , worked with a prominent lama , tenzin deleg rinpoche , whom china has branded a " terrorist " .
human rights watch said tashi phuntsog needed immediate medical attention after being " physically broken " .
the group called on china to explain the monk 's deterioration in custody .
" tashi phuntsog entered prison as a healthy man in his early 40s , and he was cast out literally as a broken man , " it said .
tashi phuntsog was detained in 2002 , 10 days after tenzin deleg rinpoche .
we welcome tashi phuntsog 's early release , but chinese officials have to explain how they allowed this to happen to someone in their custody human rights watch tenzin deleg rinpoche was later tried and sentenced to death for carrying out bomb attacks in ganzi and chengdu , in south-west china , although human rights groups dismissed the charges as groundless .
china subsequently suspended the death penalty , and on wednesday state media reported that his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment .
the chinese authorities have never said what tashi phuntsog was sentenced for , or why he was released early .
before his release , he served nearly three years of a seven-year sentence , and was held in kangding prison , near chengdu .
human rights watch said that as well as working with tenzin deleg rinpoche , he had also been instrumental in stopping a government deforestation programme .
the area where the bomb attacks allegedly took place has a large ethnic tibetan population and a history of independence activity .
china , which invaded and occupied tibet in 1950 , has been regularly criticised for its treatment of tibetans and any separatist ambitions .
