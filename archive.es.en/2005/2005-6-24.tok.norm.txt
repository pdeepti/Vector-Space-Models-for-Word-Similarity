germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system . months of disputes between state and federal governments have long hindered educational reform in germany . but after fifteen months of negotiations , the extra funding finally received the backing of the country 's powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education . a breakthrough the government hailed the agreement reached thursday as a major triumph and a step toward fostering top students and researchers . " with this , we 've achieved a real breakthrough , " said chancellor gerhard schröder .
" we 've paved the way for leading lights in science to rise in germany and to shine internationally . " " the initiative supporting research excellence that we passed today is a milestone , " agreed education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" it will serve as a springboard for our universities to get to the top international level . " backing winners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds - just under 2 billion euros in the next 6 years - are earmarked for supporting the most promising projects by young researchers at ten of germany 's leading universities .
in addition , the money will be used to establish new research centers and groups . according to the plan , germany will spend 1.9 billion euros over the next six years to improve the country 's academic institutions . the federal government will foot three-quarters of the bill and the states will fund the rest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , ten " elite " universities will be singled out with each receiving an extra 13.5 million euros a year in a bid to create world-class institutions that will attract the best and the brightest and rival universities such as harvard and oxford . a parallel program will reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research teams . the deal also commits federal and state governments to boost the budgets of the big research associations by at least three percent annually until 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is expected to face a tough battle for re-election in september , spoke of " a good day for german science . " stemming the brain drain bildunterschrift : with several studies in recent years stating that the german educational system is trailing behind internationally , the opposition conservatives said the extra funding was needed to stop an ongoing brain drain from german universities . " i 'd just like to remind people that around 100 thousand top students are leaving the country , " said the christian social union leader edmund stoiber , " and two-thirds of them will never return .
we can not afford to allow this mass exodus to continue .

once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .
unlimited " limited offers " make flying as cheap as bus travel .
but a new report suggests the heyday is almost over . say what you will about michael o 'leary and his irish discount airline , ryanair , there is no getting away from the fact that he will go down in history as an aviation trend-setter . in dispensing with the luxury and frills of flying , he was scorned by the likes of major-league elitist players such as british airways and lufthansa , but that did n't stop him from opening the skies to millions of mortal europeans and spawning a whole fleet of airlines eager to follow his lead .
now the taunting has stopped . there are some 65 discount airlines , 15 of them in germany , whose paths now cross mid-air as they make their daily runs to destinations all over the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have revolutionized holiday-making last year some 20 million passengers took advantage of the cheap seat offers , and the number this year is expected to rise to some 30 million .
the statistics all point in a positive direction for this booming industry , but mckinsey management consultants , who presented a study on the discount airlines boom in frankfurt on thursday , say the upward trend is made of fragile stuff . creating demand " their big plus has been that they are operating in newly created markets .
they went to markets when there was no demand and they created a demand .
only about a third of customers have come from more established airlines , all the rest come have been pulled off the street , so to speak .
they are people who would n't otherwise have flown , " lucio pompeo of mckinsey said . but nonetheless , that era of more than 50 percent growth is likely to come to an end . mckinsey says the coming years will see an annual growth rate of 13 percent , which is not bad , but not enough to keep all the airlines soaring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an easyjet.com airliner takes off in ciampino airport in rome , italy , in this aug .
30 , 2004 file photo .
an easyjet pilot scehduled to fly from berlin , germany , to basel switzerland , was suspended while the airline investigates whether she showed up for a flight drunk , the company said wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
the pilot was "prevented from flying duty on suspicion of being over the alcohol limit , " spokesman steve eisenberg said .
-lrb- ap photo / corrado giambalvo -rrb- " there is of course , still growth potential , especially in the markets which have n't been saturated .
and we see a clear fall in prices which is related to the competition battle between the discount airlines and the more established ones , " pompeo said . gradual decline slow growth leads to over capacity , and mckinsey says it 's only a matter of time before that takes its toll on the industry and wipes out all but two or three of the low cost airlines currently circling the continental skies . the management consultancy study predicts that the market will be occupied by the two current dominant forces , ryanair and the british company easyjet , which only entered the german market last year .
it was a profitable departure for the company , which does n't think the situation is yet as drastic as mckinsey suggests . " the market wo n't get any easier for the airlines .
it will be up to each low-cost airline itself to establish its own place on the market .
they 're already beginning to offer different products and pricing systems in a bid to attract a particular customer segment , " pompeo said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary low-budget airlines no longer only offer flights , but increasingly try to lure money out of travellers ' pockets with special hotel , car rental or insurance deals .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .

croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .

but the town has the first rights to the property which it wants to turn into a museum .
joseph ratzinger , son of joseph and maria ratzinger , was born on april 16 , 1927 in the large house , built in typical southern bavarian style , with a wide wooden roof , geraniums on the window sills and white and yellow painted facade . since cardinal ratzinger 's election as pope on april 19 , faithful from around the world have descended on the village of 2,700 inhabitants , close to the austrian border . tourists who insist on visiting the house have made life miserable for dandl , who bought the house six years ago and lovingly restored it .
the two-storey house , which was built in 1745 and on a list of protected buildings , would normally fetch about 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 180,000 -rrb- but the papal connection looks set to inflate the price . last month , ratzinger 's old volkswagen went for nearly a quarter of a million dollars on the online auction site ebay germany .
and a month ago , the pope 's former apartment in bonn went on sale on the internet . meanwhile , marktl mayor hubert gschwendtner said the town would like to acquire the property and convert it into a museum .
" we would like to open the pope 's home to the faithful , " he said .
gschwendtner 's dream is that the pope would return to marktl for the official opening . dw-world.de pope 's birthplace ecstatic as visitors flock residents of joseph ratzinger 's tiny birthplace of marktl in bavaria who have greeted his election as pope with unrestrained joy and partying now find themselves at the center of world attention .

the eu commission in brussels authorized the transaction on friday on the grounds that it would not greatly hinder competition as both companies have a limited market share in germany and growth rates on the austrian market are slow .

salvador carmona and aaron galindo were kicked out of the competition by mexico coach ricardo lavolpe on tuesday , with rumors abounding that the duo had tested positive for nandrolone .
but beckenbauer , head of germany 's 2006 world cup committee , said he had been told by fifa president sepp blatter that drug taking had nothing to do with the scandal .
" he -lrb- blatter -rrb- assured me that this was purely a disciplinary matter and nothing to do with doping .

germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system . months of disputes between state and federal governments have long hindered educational reform in germany . but after fifteen months of negotiations , the extra funding finally received the backing of the country 's powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education . a breakthrough the government hailed the agreement reached thursday as a major triumph and a step toward fostering top students and researchers . " with this , we 've achieved a real breakthrough , " said chancellor gerhard schröder .
" we 've paved the way for leading lights in science to rise in germany and to shine internationally . " " the initiative supporting research excellence that we passed today is a milestone , " agreed education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" it will serve as a springboard for our universities to get to the top international level . " backing winners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds - just under 2 billion euros in the next 6 years - are earmarked for supporting the most promising projects by young researchers at ten of germany 's leading universities .
in addition , the money will be used to establish new research centers and groups . according to the plan , germany will spend 1.9 billion euros over the next six years to improve the country 's academic institutions . the federal government will foot three-quarters of the bill and the states will fund the rest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , ten " elite " universities will be singled out with each receiving an extra 13.5 million euros a year in a bid to create world-class institutions that will attract the best and the brightest and rival universities such as harvard and oxford . a parallel program will reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research teams . the deal also commits federal and state governments to boost the budgets of the big research associations by at least three percent annually until 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is expected to face a tough battle for re-election in september , spoke of " a good day for german science . " stemming the brain drain bildunterschrift : with several studies in recent years stating that the german educational system is trailing behind internationally , the opposition conservatives said the extra funding was needed to stop an ongoing brain drain from german universities . " i 'd just like to remind people that around 100 thousand top students are leaving the country , " said the christian social union leader edmund stoiber , " and two-thirds of them will never return .
we can not afford to allow this mass exodus to continue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.06.2005 germany home to fewer foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't assume they 're foreigners with federal polls looming , immigration has become a hot topic on the political agenda even as a new report says the number of foreigners has dropped in recent years as increasing numbers take on german citizenship . the commissioner for integration , marieluise beck published a report on thursday which clearly shows the fall in the overall number of migrants knocking at germany 's door . the report says that the number of foreigners has fallen from 7.3 million in 2003 to 6.7 million in 2004 , meaning they now make up just eight percent of the total population of the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they all have german citizenship but one of the major reasons for the decline is an increase in the number of people born to foreign parents taking on german citizenship . one quarter of all children born in germany have at least one non-german parent , and a million of them have assumed german citizenship over the past five years . integration is key marieluise beck said a big challenge facing germany is integration , particularly in the case of children whose lack of german language skills often put them at a social disadvantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marieluise beck " if the children of immigrants are to be able to make full use of their potential , we shall need enormous effort by educators .
at the moment , we 're failing them , " she said . on thursday , german interior minister otto schily also spoke out in favor of young foreigners living in germany .
at the conference of interior ministers , he proposed granting children and youths who had been living in germany for more than six years , the chance to stay even if their parents were sent home under repatriation programs . he said children who had grown up here and perceive it as their home should not have to be uprooted just because their parents have to leave . regulating immigration of jews but , it 's not only the overall immigrant statistics that are relevant to the political agenda of the day .
this week , the tricky issue of the integration of jews from the former soviet union seemed on its way to a resolution .
the central council for jews in germany has agreed to implement tighter immigration controls on east european jews wishing to enter the country .

in fact , it has one of the best images in the world . the latest pew global attitudes survey of some 17,000 people in the united states and 15 other countries from april 20 to may 31 found that germany , france , japan and china are far more popular than the us . while 43 percent of germans are laboring under the impression that their country is despised by all and sundry , the report shows that most of those questioned actually had an extremely favorable opinion of germany - especially the french -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- , the dutch -lrb- 88 percent -rrb- , the lebanese -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- and the russians -lrb- 79 percent -rrb- . even in britain , where europe 's largest economy is broadly portrayed by the press as a nation of beer-swilling former nazis , 75 percent of respondents said they were well-disposed to germany . a global pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems that the country everyone really loves to hate is the us .

" the united states has a huge challenge at this point , " said former us secretary of state madeleine albright , co-chair of the pew global attitudes project . steady decline this year 's results confirm the decline in the us image worldwide revealed in previous polls taken annually since 2002 , most notably in western european and muslim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states received a 50-percent or better favorable rating from respondents in only six of the 16 countries surveyed .

three months before a likely german election , the opposition conservatives are far ahead of the ruling social democrats in polls .
if the election were a popularity contest , challenger angela merkel would have to worry . if the general election were to be held this coming sunday , 44 percent of voters in germany would throw their weight behind the opposition christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union . only 27 percent would vote for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats and 9 percent for their junior coalition partner , the greens , a survey by the electoral research group found . however , the survey 's other results should serve as a warning to the conservatives not to take victory for granted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are ready to fight if germans were simply to cast their ballots according to which candidate for chancellor they liked better , merkel and schröder would find themselves tied at 44 percent . the bad news for merkel is that her personal popularity rating have dropped four points since early june , while schröder gained three points . spd tax policy a hit the survey also found that 70 percent of germans are responding positively to proposals by the spd to hit the rich with new taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several spd leaders have said they want to increase income taxes on those earning above 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 305,000 -rrb- a year - a policy the cdu rejects .

in fact , it has one of the best images in the world . the latest pew global attitudes survey of some 17,000 people in the united states and 15 other countries from april 20 to may 31 found that germany , france , japan and china are far more popular than the us . while 43 percent of germans are laboring under the impression that their country is despised by all and sundry , the report shows that most of those questioned actually had an extremely favorable opinion of germany - especially the french -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- , the dutch -lrb- 88 percent -rrb- , the lebanese -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- and the russians -lrb- 79 percent -rrb- . even in britain , where europe 's largest economy is broadly portrayed by the press as a nation of beer-swilling former nazis , 75 percent of respondents said they were well-disposed to germany . a global pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems that the country everyone really loves to hate is the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.06.2005 cheap airlines reach the sky 's limits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair makes dreams come true ...
once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .
unlimited " limited offers " make flying as cheap as bus travel .
but a new report suggests the heyday is almost over . say what you will about michael o 'leary and his irish discount airline , ryanair , there is no getting away from the fact that he will go down in history as an aviation trend-setter . in dispensing with the luxury and frills of flying , he was scorned by the likes of major-league elitist players such as british airways and lufthansa , but that did n't stop him from opening the skies to millions of mortal europeans and spawning a whole fleet of airlines eager to follow his lead .
now the taunting has stopped . there are some 65 discount airlines , 15 of them in germany , whose paths now cross mid-air as they make their daily runs to destinations all over the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have revolutionized holiday-making last year some 20 million passengers took advantage of the cheap seat offers , and the number this year is expected to rise to some 30 million .
the statistics all point in a positive direction for this booming industry , but mckinsey management consultants , who presented a study on the discount airlines boom in frankfurt on thursday , say the upward trend is made of fragile stuff . creating demand " their big plus has been that they are operating in newly created markets .
they went to markets when there was no demand and they created a demand .
only about a third of customers have come from more established airlines , all the rest come have been pulled off the street , so to speak .
they are people who would n't otherwise have flown , " lucio pompeo of mckinsey said . but nonetheless , that era of more than 50 percent growth is likely to come to an end . mckinsey says the coming years will see an annual growth rate of 13 percent , which is not bad , but not enough to keep all the airlines soaring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an easyjet.com airliner takes off in ciampino airport in rome , italy , in this aug .
30 , 2004 file photo .
an easyjet pilot scehduled to fly from berlin , germany , to basel switzerland , was suspended while the airline investigates whether she showed up for a flight drunk , the company said wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
the pilot was "prevented from flying duty on suspicion of being over the alcohol limit , " spokesman steve eisenberg said .
-lrb- ap photo / corrado giambalvo -rrb- " there is of course , still growth potential , especially in the markets which have n't been saturated .
and we see a clear fall in prices which is related to the competition battle between the discount airlines and the more established ones , " pompeo said . gradual decline slow growth leads to over capacity , and mckinsey says it 's only a matter of time before that takes its toll on the industry and wipes out all but two or three of the low cost airlines currently circling the continental skies . the management consultancy study predicts that the market will be occupied by the two current dominant forces , ryanair and the british company easyjet , which only entered the german market last year .
it was a profitable departure for the company , which does n't think the situation is yet as drastic as mckinsey suggests . " the market wo n't get any easier for the airlines .
it will be up to each low-cost airline itself to establish its own place on the market .
they 're already beginning to offer different products and pricing systems in a bid to attract a particular customer segment , " pompeo said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary low-budget airlines no longer only offer flights , but increasingly try to lure money out of travellers ' pockets with special hotel , car rental or insurance deals .
and one airline has already pledged to give away seats for a couple of years on the basis that it can remain profitable with such sideline businesses .
no prizes for guessing which irish airline that might be . monika lohmüller -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ryanair plans new german base ryanair , the irish no-frills airline , announced it had reached an agreement over plans for a new european hub at lübeck airport near hamburg in northern germany that would cater for two million passengers annually .

germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system . months of disputes between state and federal governments have long hindered educational reform in germany . but after fifteen months of negotiations , the extra funding finally received the backing of the country 's powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education . a breakthrough the government hailed the agreement reached thursday as a major triumph and a step toward fostering top students and researchers . " with this , we 've achieved a real breakthrough , " said chancellor gerhard schröder .
" we 've paved the way for leading lights in science to rise in germany and to shine internationally . " " the initiative supporting research excellence that we passed today is a milestone , " agreed education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" it will serve as a springboard for our universities to get to the top international level . " backing winners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds - just under 2 billion euros in the next 6 years - are earmarked for supporting the most promising projects by young researchers at ten of germany 's leading universities .
in addition , the money will be used to establish new research centers and groups . according to the plan , germany will spend 1.9 billion euros over the next six years to improve the country 's academic institutions . the federal government will foot three-quarters of the bill and the states will fund the rest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , ten " elite " universities will be singled out with each receiving an extra 13.5 million euros a year in a bid to create world-class institutions that will attract the best and the brightest and rival universities such as harvard and oxford . a parallel program will reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research teams . the deal also commits federal and state governments to boost the budgets of the big research associations by at least three percent annually until 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is expected to face a tough battle for re-election in september , spoke of " a good day for german science . " stemming the brain drain bildunterschrift : with several studies in recent years stating that the german educational system is trailing behind internationally , the opposition conservatives said the extra funding was needed to stop an ongoing brain drain from german universities .

once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .
unlimited " limited offers " make flying as cheap as bus travel .
but a new report suggests the heyday is almost over . say what you will about michael o 'leary and his irish discount airline , ryanair , there is no getting away from the fact that he will go down in history as an aviation trend-setter . in dispensing with the luxury and frills of flying , he was scorned by the likes of major-league elitist players such as british airways and lufthansa , but that did n't stop him from opening the skies to millions of mortal europeans and spawning a whole fleet of airlines eager to follow his lead .
now the taunting has stopped . there are some 65 discount airlines , 15 of them in germany , whose paths now cross mid-air as they make their daily runs to destinations all over the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have revolutionized holiday-making last year some 20 million passengers took advantage of the cheap seat offers , and the number this year is expected to rise to some 30 million .
the statistics all point in a positive direction for this booming industry , but mckinsey management consultants , who presented a study on the discount airlines boom in frankfurt on thursday , say the upward trend is made of fragile stuff . creating demand " their big plus has been that they are operating in newly created markets .
they went to markets when there was no demand and they created a demand .
only about a third of customers have come from more established airlines , all the rest come have been pulled off the street , so to speak .
they are people who would n't otherwise have flown , " lucio pompeo of mckinsey said . but nonetheless , that era of more than 50 percent growth is likely to come to an end . mckinsey says the coming years will see an annual growth rate of 13 percent , which is not bad , but not enough to keep all the airlines soaring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an easyjet.com airliner takes off in ciampino airport in rome , italy , in this aug .
30 , 2004 file photo .
an easyjet pilot scehduled to fly from berlin , germany , to basel switzerland , was suspended while the airline investigates whether she showed up for a flight drunk , the company said wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
the pilot was "prevented from flying duty on suspicion of being over the alcohol limit , " spokesman steve eisenberg said .
-lrb- ap photo / corrado giambalvo -rrb- " there is of course , still growth potential , especially in the markets which have n't been saturated .
and we see a clear fall in prices which is related to the competition battle between the discount airlines and the more established ones , " pompeo said . gradual decline slow growth leads to over capacity , and mckinsey says it 's only a matter of time before that takes its toll on the industry and wipes out all but two or three of the low cost airlines currently circling the continental skies . the management consultancy study predicts that the market will be occupied by the two current dominant forces , ryanair and the british company easyjet , which only entered the german market last year .
it was a profitable departure for the company , which does n't think the situation is yet as drastic as mckinsey suggests . " the market wo n't get any easier for the airlines .
it will be up to each low-cost airline itself to establish its own place on the market .
they 're already beginning to offer different products and pricing systems in a bid to attract a particular customer segment , " pompeo said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary low-budget airlines no longer only offer flights , but increasingly try to lure money out of travellers ' pockets with special hotel , car rental or insurance deals .
and one airline has already pledged to give away seats for a couple of years on the basis that it can remain profitable with such sideline businesses .
no prizes for guessing which irish airline that might be . monika lohmüller -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ryanair plans new german base ryanair , the irish no-frills airline , announced it had reached an agreement over plans for a new european hub at lübeck airport near hamburg in northern germany that would cater for two million passengers annually .

germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system . months of disputes between state and federal governments have long hindered educational reform in germany . but after fifteen months of negotiations , the extra funding finally received the backing of the country 's powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education . a breakthrough the government hailed the agreement reached thursday as a major triumph and a step toward fostering top students and researchers . " with this , we 've achieved a real breakthrough , " said chancellor gerhard schröder .
" we 've paved the way for leading lights in science to rise in germany and to shine internationally . " " the initiative supporting research excellence that we passed today is a milestone , " agreed education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" it will serve as a springboard for our universities to get to the top international level . " backing winners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds - just under 2 billion euros in the next 6 years - are earmarked for supporting the most promising projects by young researchers at ten of germany 's leading universities .
in addition , the money will be used to establish new research centers and groups . according to the plan , germany will spend 1.9 billion euros over the next six years to improve the country 's academic institutions . the federal government will foot three-quarters of the bill and the states will fund the rest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , ten " elite " universities will be singled out with each receiving an extra 13.5 million euros a year in a bid to create world-class institutions that will attract the best and the brightest and rival universities such as harvard and oxford . a parallel program will reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research teams . the deal also commits federal and state governments to boost the budgets of the big research associations by at least three percent annually until 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is expected to face a tough battle for re-election in september , spoke of " a good day for german science . " stemming the brain drain bildunterschrift : with several studies in recent years stating that the german educational system is trailing behind internationally , the opposition conservatives said the extra funding was needed to stop an ongoing brain drain from german universities . " i 'd just like to remind people that around 100 thousand top students are leaving the country , " said the christian social union leader edmund stoiber , " and two-thirds of them will never return .
we can not afford to allow this mass exodus to continue .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been sporting some attention-grabbing outfits ever since becoming her country 's top diplomat .
but a suit she recently wore had already appeared on the world stage before . in brussels to attend a joint eu-us conference to rally help for iraq , rice wore a white jacket with black trimmings .
that 's nothing unusual and far more subdued that some of the brightly colored suits she has showcased during international meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing a very red suit , rice met russian president vladimir putin on april 20 ahead of the may 9 celebrations to mark the anniversary of the end of world war ii but condi was n't the first to discover the 1,790-euro -lrb- $ 2,160 -rrb- combination that includes a black skirt .
a little over a month ago , doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder , wore the same outfit to attend the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow . rice did n't attend that event , so it 's unclear whether the suit only grabbed her attention after she saw pictures of schröder-köpf or whether she had already bought her own version by then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder-köpf likes her black-and-white combos , as proven by this one she wore when she showed berlin 's old national gallery to us first lady laura bush in 2002 the fact that the suit is " wrinkle-free , " according to its munich designer , could well be the clincher for any frequent flyer .

" as a german , i expect to be mortified in front of my organizational colleagues from the other participating countries , " he said .
" in england and the us politicians and big business have been enormously cooperative .
germany should be ashamed of itself . " " bewildered " by criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to lieberberg , the parliament 's president , wolfgang thierse , refused to approve use of the republic square " in case it damaged the water sprinklers . " " what country are we living in ? "
liberberg said .
" has our national depression finally got the better of us ? " but a spokesman for thierse said that he had not been approached for assistance and said that a permit to use the square would have to come from local authorities . the spokesman for the german capital 's government , michael donnermeyer , said he was bewildered by the criticism and that authorities had done " everything in their power " to assure the show would go off well despite the short planning time . saint bob continues to raise awareness lieberberg was approached five weeks ago by irish pop star-turned aid activist bob geldof , who initiated the live8 concerts , to be held the same day in cities including london , philadelphia , paris , rome , tokyo and ottowa . geldof , who organized the massive live aid fund-raising charity concerts in 1985 , hopes the latest event will raise awareness of african aid issues ahead of the g8 leaders ' summit in gleneagles , scotland , starting four days later . bildunterschrift : international acts including green day , roxy music , brian wilson of the beach boys and a-ha and german stars such as herbert grönemeyer and wir sind helden -lrb- photo -rrb- have signed on for the show in berlin 's city center , and some 100,000 visitors are expected . no german sponsor one week ahead of the event , lieberberg also said that organizational support is not all that 's missing in germany . " unless a miracle happens , germany will be the only country involved without a single national sponsor getting on board with so much as one cent , " he complained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's now defunct love parade with the siegessäule in the background " we 've met with nothing but rejections or silence from the 50 german companies and banks we wrote to , " he said .
" given the global problem as well as the effect it will have on germany 's image , i find that unbelievable . "

once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .
unlimited " limited offers " make flying as cheap as bus travel .
but a new report suggests the heyday is almost over . say what you will about michael o 'leary and his irish discount airline , ryanair , there is no getting away from the fact that he will go down in history as an aviation trend-setter . in dispensing with the luxury and frills of flying , he was scorned by the likes of major-league elitist players such as british airways and lufthansa , but that did n't stop him from opening the skies to millions of mortal europeans and spawning a whole fleet of airlines eager to follow his lead .
now the taunting has stopped . there are some 65 discount airlines , 15 of them in germany , whose paths now cross mid-air as they make their daily runs to destinations all over the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have revolutionized holiday-making last year some 20 million passengers took advantage of the cheap seat offers , and the number this year is expected to rise to some 30 million .
the statistics all point in a positive direction for this booming industry , but mckinsey management consultants , who presented a study on the discount airlines boom in frankfurt on thursday , say the upward trend is made of fragile stuff . creating demand " their big plus has been that they are operating in newly created markets .
they went to markets when there was no demand and they created a demand .
only about a third of customers have come from more established airlines , all the rest come have been pulled off the street , so to speak .
they are people who would n't otherwise have flown , " lucio pompeo of mckinsey said . but nonetheless , that era of more than 50 percent growth is likely to come to an end . mckinsey says the coming years will see an annual growth rate of 13 percent , which is not bad , but not enough to keep all the airlines soaring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an easyjet.com airliner takes off in ciampino airport in rome , italy , in this aug .
30 , 2004 file photo .
an easyjet pilot scehduled to fly from berlin , germany , to basel switzerland , was suspended while the airline investigates whether she showed up for a flight drunk , the company said wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .

and we see a clear fall in prices which is related to the competition battle between the discount airlines and the more established ones , " pompeo said . gradual decline slow growth leads to over capacity , and mckinsey says it 's only a matter of time before that takes its toll on the industry and wipes out all but two or three of the low cost airlines currently circling the continental skies . the management consultancy study predicts that the market will be occupied by the two current dominant forces , ryanair and the british company easyjet , which only entered the german market last year .
it was a profitable departure for the company , which does n't think the situation is yet as drastic as mckinsey suggests . " the market wo n't get any easier for the airlines .
it will be up to each low-cost airline itself to establish its own place on the market .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there .

" as a german , i expect to be mortified in front of my organizational colleagues from the other participating countries , " he said .
" in england and the us politicians and big business have been enormously cooperative .
germany should be ashamed of itself . " " bewildered " by criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to lieberberg , the parliament 's president , wolfgang thierse , refused to approve use of the republic square " in case it damaged the water sprinklers . " " what country are we living in ? "
liberberg said .
" has our national depression finally got the better of us ? " but a spokesman for thierse said that he had not been approached for assistance and said that a permit to use the square would have to come from local authorities . the spokesman for the german capital 's government , michael donnermeyer , said he was bewildered by the criticism and that authorities had done " everything in their power " to assure the show would go off well despite the short planning time . saint bob continues to raise awareness lieberberg was approached five weeks ago by irish pop star-turned aid activist bob geldof , who initiated the live8 concerts , to be held the same day in cities including london , philadelphia , paris , rome , tokyo and ottowa . geldof , who organized the massive live aid fund-raising charity concerts in 1985 , hopes the latest event will raise awareness of african aid issues ahead of the g8 leaders ' summit in gleneagles , scotland , starting four days later . bildunterschrift : international acts including green day , roxy music , brian wilson of the beach boys and a-ha and german stars such as herbert grönemeyer and wir sind helden -lrb- photo -rrb- have signed on for the show in berlin 's city center , and some 100,000 visitors are expected . no german sponsor one week ahead of the event , lieberberg also said that organizational support is not all that 's missing in germany . " unless a miracle happens , germany will be the only country involved without a single national sponsor getting on board with so much as one cent , " he complained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's now defunct love parade with the siegessäule in the background " we 've met with nothing but rejections or silence from the 50 german companies and banks we wrote to , " he said .
" given the global problem as well as the effect it will have on germany 's image , i find that unbelievable . "
the concert is now scheduled to take place around berlin 's siegessäule , or victory column , where the city 's world famous and now defunct love parade converged until 2003 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 finance ministers under pressure finance ministers of the g8 are holding a preparatory meeting in london on friday and saturday ahead of next month 's summit in gleneagles , scotland .

once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .
unlimited " limited offers " make flying as cheap as bus travel .
but a new report suggests the heyday is almost over . say what you will about michael o 'leary and his irish discount airline , ryanair , there is no getting away from the fact that he will go down in history as an aviation trend-setter . in dispensing with the luxury and frills of flying , he was scorned by the likes of major-league elitist players such as british airways and lufthansa , but that did n't stop him from opening the skies to millions of mortal europeans and spawning a whole fleet of airlines eager to follow his lead .
now the taunting has stopped . there are some 65 discount airlines , 15 of them in germany , whose paths now cross mid-air as they make their daily runs to destinations all over the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have revolutionized holiday-making last year some 20 million passengers took advantage of the cheap seat offers , and the number this year is expected to rise to some 30 million .
the statistics all point in a positive direction for this booming industry , but mckinsey management consultants , who presented a study on the discount airlines boom in frankfurt on thursday , say the upward trend is made of fragile stuff . creating demand " their big plus has been that they are operating in newly created markets .
they went to markets when there was no demand and they created a demand .
only about a third of customers have come from more established airlines , all the rest come have been pulled off the street , so to speak .
they are people who would n't otherwise have flown , " lucio pompeo of mckinsey said . but nonetheless , that era of more than 50 percent growth is likely to come to an end . mckinsey says the coming years will see an annual growth rate of 13 percent , which is not bad , but not enough to keep all the airlines soaring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an easyjet.com airliner takes off in ciampino airport in rome , italy , in this aug .
30 , 2004 file photo .
an easyjet pilot scehduled to fly from berlin , germany , to basel switzerland , was suspended while the airline investigates whether she showed up for a flight drunk , the company said wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
the pilot was "prevented from flying duty on suspicion of being over the alcohol limit , " spokesman steve eisenberg said .
-lrb- ap photo / corrado giambalvo -rrb- " there is of course , still growth potential , especially in the markets which have n't been saturated .
and we see a clear fall in prices which is related to the competition battle between the discount airlines and the more established ones , " pompeo said . gradual decline slow growth leads to over capacity , and mckinsey says it 's only a matter of time before that takes its toll on the industry and wipes out all but two or three of the low cost airlines currently circling the continental skies . the management consultancy study predicts that the market will be occupied by the two current dominant forces , ryanair and the british company easyjet , which only entered the german market last year .
it was a profitable departure for the company , which does n't think the situation is yet as drastic as mckinsey suggests . " the market wo n't get any easier for the airlines .
it will be up to each low-cost airline itself to establish its own place on the market .
they 're already beginning to offer different products and pricing systems in a bid to attract a particular customer segment , " pompeo said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary low-budget airlines no longer only offer flights , but increasingly try to lure money out of travellers ' pockets with special hotel , car rental or insurance deals .
and one airline has already pledged to give away seats for a couple of years on the basis that it can remain profitable with such sideline businesses .
no prizes for guessing which irish airline that might be . monika lohmüller -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ryanair plans new german base ryanair , the irish no-frills airline , announced it had reached an agreement over plans for a new european hub at lübeck airport near hamburg in northern germany that would cater for two million passengers annually .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.06.2005 drawing the unimaginable großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today graphic novels are n't afraid to take on previously taboo topics for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .
but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there . " kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping the holocaust relevant as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations .

in fact , it has one of the best images in the world . the latest pew global attitudes survey of some 17,000 people in the united states and 15 other countries from april 20 to may 31 found that germany , france , japan and china are far more popular than the us . while 43 percent of germans are laboring under the impression that their country is despised by all and sundry , the report shows that most of those questioned actually had an extremely favorable opinion of germany - especially the french -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- , the dutch -lrb- 88 percent -rrb- , the lebanese -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- and the russians -lrb- 79 percent -rrb- . even in britain , where europe 's largest economy is broadly portrayed by the press as a nation of beer-swilling former nazis , 75 percent of respondents said they were well-disposed to germany . a global pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems that the country everyone really loves to hate is the us .
anti-american sentiment is firmly entrenched around the world , mainly because of president george w. bush and his policies , to such a degree that even us humanitarian efforts do little to curb it , according to the poll released thursday . negative attitudes about the united states are so strong , even among traditional allies such as the french and canadians , that us aid to tsunami victims or bush 's encouragement of democracy in the middle east have done little to blunt them . the report cited the re-election of bush in november and the continuing war in iraq - one of his major policy priorities - as the principal causes of the lingering anti-us feeling . " the united states has a huge challenge at this point , " said former us secretary of state madeleine albright , co-chair of the pew global attitudes project . steady decline this year 's results confirm the decline in the us image worldwide revealed in previous polls taken annually since 2002 , most notably in western european and muslim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states received a 50-percent or better favorable rating from respondents in only six of the 16 countries surveyed .
in contrast , germany , france , and japan received it from 13 countries , and china from 11 . attitudes towards the united states were most positive in india , with 71 percent , and least positive in jordan , with 21 percent . the notable exceptions were in indonesia , where the number of people reporting a favorable image of the united states more than doubled from 15 percent to 38 percent in the wake of a massive us-led relief effort for tsunami victims late last year , and in jordan , where only five percent gave the united states a good mark last year . in china , which was included in the poll this year for the first time , 42 percent had a favorable opinion of the united states , nearly the same percentage as in france -lrb- 43 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 41 percent -rrb- and spain -lrb- 41 percent -rrb- . germany and the question of pride chancellor gerhard schröder might well feel vindicated .
although his refusal to back the us-led on iraq was dismissed by many as electioneering back in 2002 , others welcomed his decision as a sign of germany 's re-emerging self-confidence on the world 's stage - reflected in its bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and although the country is battling a floundering economy and widespread fiscal gloom , recent years have seen a slow psychological shift away from the germany 's post-war shame , with younger generations embracing a new sense of national pride in a country that dares defy washington . the pew survey shows that germany is gradually stepping out of the shadows of the world 's wings - if only it would forget its current woes and realize it itself . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german patriotism : the road to berlin goes via baghdad george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .

although his refusal to back the us-led on iraq was dismissed by many as electioneering back in 2002 , others welcomed his decision as a sign of germany 's re-emerging self-confidence on the world 's stage - reflected in its bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and although the country is battling a floundering economy and widespread fiscal gloom , recent years have seen a slow psychological shift away from the germany 's post-war shame , with younger generations embracing a new sense of national pride in a country that dares defy washington . the pew survey shows that germany is gradually stepping out of the shadows of the world 's wings - if only it would forget its current woes and realize it itself . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german patriotism : the road to berlin goes via baghdad george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .

three months before a likely german election , the opposition conservatives are far ahead of the ruling social democrats in polls .
if the election were a popularity contest , challenger angela merkel would have to worry . if the general election were to be held this coming sunday , 44 percent of voters in germany would throw their weight behind the opposition christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union . only 27 percent would vote for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats and 9 percent for their junior coalition partner , the greens , a survey by the electoral research group found . however , the survey 's other results should serve as a warning to the conservatives not to take victory for granted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are ready to fight if germans were simply to cast their ballots according to which candidate for chancellor they liked better , merkel and schröder would find themselves tied at 44 percent . the bad news for merkel is that her personal popularity rating have dropped four points since early june , while schröder gained three points . spd tax policy a hit the survey also found that 70 percent of germans are responding positively to proposals by the spd to hit the rich with new taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several spd leaders have said they want to increase income taxes on those earning above 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 305,000 -rrb- a year - a policy the cdu rejects . " i 'm against any special tax of this sort , " said karl-josef laumann , a cdu executive member , on zdf television .
" we need these people for investments and creating jobs . " an equally large 70 percent of those polled said they oppose any further cuts to the country 's social welfare and unemployment benefits system .
the cdu has pledged to make even steeper cuts than schröder has already made as part of his agenda 2010 . while the latest survey is a further reflection on germans ' desire for strong leadership , it also delivered a general stab at all the mainstream parties now scrambling for support in september . forty percent of people questioned said that none of the main parties is trustworthy anymore .
they also criticized leaders for lacking political vision beyond their respective legislative term . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .

once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .
unlimited " limited offers " make flying as cheap as bus travel .
but a new report suggests the heyday is almost over . say what you will about michael o 'leary and his irish discount airline , ryanair , there is no getting away from the fact that he will go down in history as an aviation trend-setter . in dispensing with the luxury and frills of flying , he was scorned by the likes of major-league elitist players such as british airways and lufthansa , but that did n't stop him from opening the skies to millions of mortal europeans and spawning a whole fleet of airlines eager to follow his lead .
now the taunting has stopped . there are some 65 discount airlines , 15 of them in germany , whose paths now cross mid-air as they make their daily runs to destinations all over the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have revolutionized holiday-making last year some 20 million passengers took advantage of the cheap seat offers , and the number this year is expected to rise to some 30 million .
the statistics all point in a positive direction for this booming industry , but mckinsey management consultants , who presented a study on the discount airlines boom in frankfurt on thursday , say the upward trend is made of fragile stuff . creating demand " their big plus has been that they are operating in newly created markets .
they went to markets when there was no demand and they created a demand .
only about a third of customers have come from more established airlines , all the rest come have been pulled off the street , so to speak .
they are people who would n't otherwise have flown , " lucio pompeo of mckinsey said . but nonetheless , that era of more than 50 percent growth is likely to come to an end . mckinsey says the coming years will see an annual growth rate of 13 percent , which is not bad , but not enough to keep all the airlines soaring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an easyjet.com airliner takes off in ciampino airport in rome , italy , in this aug .
30 , 2004 file photo .
an easyjet pilot scehduled to fly from berlin , germany , to basel switzerland , was suspended while the airline investigates whether she showed up for a flight drunk , the company said wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
the pilot was "prevented from flying duty on suspicion of being over the alcohol limit , " spokesman steve eisenberg said .
-lrb- ap photo / corrado giambalvo -rrb- " there is of course , still growth potential , especially in the markets which have n't been saturated .
and we see a clear fall in prices which is related to the competition battle between the discount airlines and the more established ones , " pompeo said . gradual decline slow growth leads to over capacity , and mckinsey says it 's only a matter of time before that takes its toll on the industry and wipes out all but two or three of the low cost airlines currently circling the continental skies . the management consultancy study predicts that the market will be occupied by the two current dominant forces , ryanair and the british company easyjet , which only entered the german market last year .
it was a profitable departure for the company , which does n't think the situation is yet as drastic as mckinsey suggests . " the market wo n't get any easier for the airlines .
it will be up to each low-cost airline itself to establish its own place on the market .
they 're already beginning to offer different products and pricing systems in a bid to attract a particular customer segment , " pompeo said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary low-budget airlines no longer only offer flights , but increasingly try to lure money out of travellers ' pockets with special hotel , car rental or insurance deals .
and one airline has already pledged to give away seats for a couple of years on the basis that it can remain profitable with such sideline businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.06.2005 drawing the unimaginable großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today graphic novels are n't afraid to take on previously taboo topics for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .
but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.06.2005 drawing the unimaginable großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today graphic novels are n't afraid to take on previously taboo topics for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .
but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there . " kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping the holocaust relevant as europe observes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of nazi concentration camps , holocaust educators in germany are wondering how to keep its lessons relevant to future generations .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been sporting some attention-grabbing outfits ever since becoming her country 's top diplomat .
but a suit she recently wore had already appeared on the world stage before . in brussels to attend a joint eu-us conference to rally help for iraq , rice wore a white jacket with black trimmings .
that 's nothing unusual and far more subdued that some of the brightly colored suits she has showcased during international meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing a very red suit , rice met russian president vladimir putin on april 20 ahead of the may 9 celebrations to mark the anniversary of the end of world war ii but condi was n't the first to discover the 1,790-euro -lrb- $ 2,160 -rrb- combination that includes a black skirt .
a little over a month ago , doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder , wore the same outfit to attend the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow . rice did n't attend that event , so it 's unclear whether the suit only grabbed her attention after she saw pictures of schröder-köpf or whether she had already bought her own version by then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder-köpf likes her black-and-white combos , as proven by this one she wore when she showed berlin 's old national gallery to us first lady laura bush in 2002 the fact that the suit is " wrinkle-free , " according to its munich designer , could well be the clincher for any frequent flyer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.06.2005 drawing the unimaginable großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today graphic novels are n't afraid to take on previously taboo topics for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .
but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .

croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .

germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system . months of disputes between state and federal governments have long hindered educational reform in germany . but after fifteen months of negotiations , the extra funding finally received the backing of the country 's powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education . a breakthrough the government hailed the agreement reached thursday as a major triumph and a step toward fostering top students and researchers . " with this , we 've achieved a real breakthrough , " said chancellor gerhard schröder .
" we 've paved the way for leading lights in science to rise in germany and to shine internationally . " " the initiative supporting research excellence that we passed today is a milestone , " agreed education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" it will serve as a springboard for our universities to get to the top international level . " backing winners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds - just under 2 billion euros in the next 6 years - are earmarked for supporting the most promising projects by young researchers at ten of germany 's leading universities .
in addition , the money will be used to establish new research centers and groups . according to the plan , germany will spend 1.9 billion euros over the next six years to improve the country 's academic institutions . the federal government will foot three-quarters of the bill and the states will fund the rest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , ten " elite " universities will be singled out with each receiving an extra 13.5 million euros a year in a bid to create world-class institutions that will attract the best and the brightest and rival universities such as harvard and oxford . a parallel program will reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research teams . the deal also commits federal and state governments to boost the budgets of the big research associations by at least three percent annually until 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is expected to face a tough battle for re-election in september , spoke of " a good day for german science . " stemming the brain drain bildunterschrift : with several studies in recent years stating that the german educational system is trailing behind internationally , the opposition conservatives said the extra funding was needed to stop an ongoing brain drain from german universities . " i 'd just like to remind people that around 100 thousand top students are leaving the country , " said the christian social union leader edmund stoiber , " and two-thirds of them will never return .
we can not afford to allow this mass exodus to continue . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de row over german university funding in an attempt to make german universities more competitive internationally , germany 's federal and state governments have agreed on a billion-euro investment program .

in fact , it has one of the best images in the world . the latest pew global attitudes survey of some 17,000 people in the united states and 15 other countries from april 20 to may 31 found that germany , france , japan and china are far more popular than the us . while 43 percent of germans are laboring under the impression that their country is despised by all and sundry , the report shows that most of those questioned actually had an extremely favorable opinion of germany - especially the french -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- , the dutch -lrb- 88 percent -rrb- , the lebanese -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- and the russians -lrb- 79 percent -rrb- . even in britain , where europe 's largest economy is broadly portrayed by the press as a nation of beer-swilling former nazis , 75 percent of respondents said they were well-disposed to germany . a global pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems that the country everyone really loves to hate is the us .

" the united states has a huge challenge at this point , " said former us secretary of state madeleine albright , co-chair of the pew global attitudes project . steady decline this year 's results confirm the decline in the us image worldwide revealed in previous polls taken annually since 2002 , most notably in western european and muslim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states received a 50-percent or better favorable rating from respondents in only six of the 16 countries surveyed .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .

often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there .

" as a german , i expect to be mortified in front of my organizational colleagues from the other participating countries , " he said .
" in england and the us politicians and big business have been enormously cooperative .
germany should be ashamed of itself . " " bewildered " by criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to lieberberg , the parliament 's president , wolfgang thierse , refused to approve use of the republic square " in case it damaged the water sprinklers . " " what country are we living in ? "
liberberg said .
" has our national depression finally got the better of us ? " but a spokesman for thierse said that he had not been approached for assistance and said that a permit to use the square would have to come from local authorities . the spokesman for the german capital 's government , michael donnermeyer , said he was bewildered by the criticism and that authorities had done " everything in their power " to assure the show would go off well despite the short planning time . saint bob continues to raise awareness lieberberg was approached five weeks ago by irish pop star-turned aid activist bob geldof , who initiated the live8 concerts , to be held the same day in cities including london , philadelphia , paris , rome , tokyo and ottowa . geldof , who organized the massive live aid fund-raising charity concerts in 1985 , hopes the latest event will raise awareness of african aid issues ahead of the g8 leaders ' summit in gleneagles , scotland , starting four days later . bildunterschrift : international acts including green day , roxy music , brian wilson of the beach boys and a-ha and german stars such as herbert grönemeyer and wir sind helden -lrb- photo -rrb- have signed on for the show in berlin 's city center , and some 100,000 visitors are expected . no german sponsor one week ahead of the event , lieberberg also said that organizational support is not all that 's missing in germany .

germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system . months of disputes between state and federal governments have long hindered educational reform in germany . but after fifteen months of negotiations , the extra funding finally received the backing of the country 's powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education . a breakthrough the government hailed the agreement reached thursday as a major triumph and a step toward fostering top students and researchers . " with this , we 've achieved a real breakthrough , " said chancellor gerhard schröder .
" we 've paved the way for leading lights in science to rise in germany and to shine internationally . " " the initiative supporting research excellence that we passed today is a milestone , " agreed education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" it will serve as a springboard for our universities to get to the top international level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.06.2005 time germany learned to love itself großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's to germany 's new image it 's been stuck in self-loathing for as long as anyone can remember , but apparently , germany is n't half as disliked as it believes .
in fact , it has one of the best images in the world . the latest pew global attitudes survey of some 17,000 people in the united states and 15 other countries from april 20 to may 31 found that germany , france , japan and china are far more popular than the us . while 43 percent of germans are laboring under the impression that their country is despised by all and sundry , the report shows that most of those questioned actually had an extremely favorable opinion of germany - especially the french -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- , the dutch -lrb- 88 percent -rrb- , the lebanese -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- and the russians -lrb- 79 percent -rrb- . even in britain , where europe 's largest economy is broadly portrayed by the press as a nation of beer-swilling former nazis , 75 percent of respondents said they were well-disposed to germany . a global pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems that the country everyone really loves to hate is the us .
anti-american sentiment is firmly entrenched around the world , mainly because of president george w. bush and his policies , to such a degree that even us humanitarian efforts do little to curb it , according to the poll released thursday . negative attitudes about the united states are so strong , even among traditional allies such as the french and canadians , that us aid to tsunami victims or bush 's encouragement of democracy in the middle east have done little to blunt them . the report cited the re-election of bush in november and the continuing war in iraq - one of his major policy priorities - as the principal causes of the lingering anti-us feeling . " the united states has a huge challenge at this point , " said former us secretary of state madeleine albright , co-chair of the pew global attitudes project . steady decline this year 's results confirm the decline in the us image worldwide revealed in previous polls taken annually since 2002 , most notably in western european and muslim countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states received a 50-percent or better favorable rating from respondents in only six of the 16 countries surveyed .
in contrast , germany , france , and japan received it from 13 countries , and china from 11 . attitudes towards the united states were most positive in india , with 71 percent , and least positive in jordan , with 21 percent . the notable exceptions were in indonesia , where the number of people reporting a favorable image of the united states more than doubled from 15 percent to 38 percent in the wake of a massive us-led relief effort for tsunami victims late last year , and in jordan , where only five percent gave the united states a good mark last year . in china , which was included in the poll this year for the first time , 42 percent had a favorable opinion of the united states , nearly the same percentage as in france -lrb- 43 percent -rrb- , germany -lrb- 41 percent -rrb- and spain -lrb- 41 percent -rrb- . germany and the question of pride chancellor gerhard schröder might well feel vindicated .
although his refusal to back the us-led on iraq was dismissed by many as electioneering back in 2002 , others welcomed his decision as a sign of germany 's re-emerging self-confidence on the world 's stage - reflected in its bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and although the country is battling a floundering economy and widespread fiscal gloom , recent years have seen a slow psychological shift away from the germany 's post-war shame , with younger generations embracing a new sense of national pride in a country that dares defy washington . the pew survey shows that germany is gradually stepping out of the shadows of the world 's wings - if only it would forget its current woes and realize it itself . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german patriotism : the road to berlin goes via baghdad george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .

in fact , it has one of the best images in the world . the latest pew global attitudes survey of some 17,000 people in the united states and 15 other countries from april 20 to may 31 found that germany , france , japan and china are far more popular than the us . while 43 percent of germans are laboring under the impression that their country is despised by all and sundry , the report shows that most of those questioned actually had an extremely favorable opinion of germany - especially the french -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- , the dutch -lrb- 88 percent -rrb- , the lebanese -lrb- 85 percent -rrb- and the russians -lrb- 79 percent -rrb- . even in britain , where europe 's largest economy is broadly portrayed by the press as a nation of beer-swilling former nazis , 75 percent of respondents said they were well-disposed to germany . a global pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it seems that the country everyone really loves to hate is the us .

it was a profitable departure for the company , which does n't think the situation is yet as drastic as mckinsey suggests . " the market wo n't get any easier for the airlines .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.06.2005 drawing the unimaginable großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today graphic novels are n't afraid to take on previously taboo topics for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .
but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there .

three months before a likely german election , the opposition conservatives are far ahead of the ruling social democrats in polls .
if the election were a popularity contest , challenger angela merkel would have to worry . if the general election were to be held this coming sunday , 44 percent of voters in germany would throw their weight behind the opposition christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union . only 27 percent would vote for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats and 9 percent for their junior coalition partner , the greens , a survey by the electoral research group found . however , the survey 's other results should serve as a warning to the conservatives not to take victory for granted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are ready to fight if germans were simply to cast their ballots according to which candidate for chancellor they liked better , merkel and schröder would find themselves tied at 44 percent . the bad news for merkel is that her personal popularity rating have dropped four points since early june , while schröder gained three points . spd tax policy a hit the survey also found that 70 percent of germans are responding positively to proposals by the spd to hit the rich with new taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several spd leaders have said they want to increase income taxes on those earning above 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 305,000 -rrb- a year - a policy the cdu rejects .

three months before a likely german election , the opposition conservatives are far ahead of the ruling social democrats in polls .
if the election were a popularity contest , challenger angela merkel would have to worry . if the general election were to be held this coming sunday , 44 percent of voters in germany would throw their weight behind the opposition christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union . only 27 percent would vote for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats and 9 percent for their junior coalition partner , the greens , a survey by the electoral research group found . however , the survey 's other results should serve as a warning to the conservatives not to take victory for granted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel are ready to fight if germans were simply to cast their ballots according to which candidate for chancellor they liked better , merkel and schröder would find themselves tied at 44 percent . the bad news for merkel is that her personal popularity rating have dropped four points since early june , while schröder gained three points . spd tax policy a hit the survey also found that 70 percent of germans are responding positively to proposals by the spd to hit the rich with new taxes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several spd leaders have said they want to increase income taxes on those earning above 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 305,000 -rrb- a year - a policy the cdu rejects . " i 'm against any special tax of this sort , " said karl-josef laumann , a cdu executive member , on zdf television .
" we need these people for investments and creating jobs . " an equally large 70 percent of those polled said they oppose any further cuts to the country 's social welfare and unemployment benefits system .
the cdu has pledged to make even steeper cuts than schröder has already made as part of his agenda 2010 . while the latest survey is a further reflection on germans ' desire for strong leadership , it also delivered a general stab at all the mainstream parties now scrambling for support in september . forty percent of people questioned said that none of the main parties is trustworthy anymore .
they also criticized leaders for lacking political vision beyond their respective legislative term . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .

" as a german , i expect to be mortified in front of my organizational colleagues from the other participating countries , " he said .
" in england and the us politicians and big business have been enormously cooperative .
germany should be ashamed of itself . " " bewildered " by criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to lieberberg , the parliament 's president , wolfgang thierse , refused to approve use of the republic square " in case it damaged the water sprinklers . " " what country are we living in ? "
liberberg said .
" has our national depression finally got the better of us ? " but a spokesman for thierse said that he had not been approached for assistance and said that a permit to use the square would have to come from local authorities . the spokesman for the german capital 's government , michael donnermeyer , said he was bewildered by the criticism and that authorities had done " everything in their power " to assure the show would go off well despite the short planning time . saint bob continues to raise awareness lieberberg was approached five weeks ago by irish pop star-turned aid activist bob geldof , who initiated the live8 concerts , to be held the same day in cities including london , philadelphia , paris , rome , tokyo and ottowa . geldof , who organized the massive live aid fund-raising charity concerts in 1985 , hopes the latest event will raise awareness of african aid issues ahead of the g8 leaders ' summit in gleneagles , scotland , starting four days later . bildunterschrift : international acts including green day , roxy music , brian wilson of the beach boys and a-ha and german stars such as herbert grönemeyer and wir sind helden -lrb- photo -rrb- have signed on for the show in berlin 's city center , and some 100,000 visitors are expected . no german sponsor one week ahead of the event , lieberberg also said that organizational support is not all that 's missing in germany . " unless a miracle happens , germany will be the only country involved without a single national sponsor getting on board with so much as one cent , " he complained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's now defunct love parade with the siegessäule in the background " we 've met with nothing but rejections or silence from the 50 german companies and banks we wrote to , " he said .
" given the global problem as well as the effect it will have on germany 's image , i find that unbelievable . "

germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system . months of disputes between state and federal governments have long hindered educational reform in germany . but after fifteen months of negotiations , the extra funding finally received the backing of the country 's powerful state premiers , who are in charge of education . a breakthrough the government hailed the agreement reached thursday as a major triumph and a step toward fostering top students and researchers . " with this , we 've achieved a real breakthrough , " said chancellor gerhard schröder .
" we 've paved the way for leading lights in science to rise in germany and to shine internationally . " " the initiative supporting research excellence that we passed today is a milestone , " agreed education and research minister edelgard bulmahn .
" it will serve as a springboard for our universities to get to the top international level . " backing winners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the funds - just under 2 billion euros in the next 6 years - are earmarked for supporting the most promising projects by young researchers at ten of germany 's leading universities .
in addition , the money will be used to establish new research centers and groups . according to the plan , germany will spend 1.9 billion euros over the next six years to improve the country 's academic institutions . the federal government will foot three-quarters of the bill and the states will fund the rest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the program , ten " elite " universities will be singled out with each receiving an extra 13.5 million euros a year in a bid to create world-class institutions that will attract the best and the brightest and rival universities such as harvard and oxford . a parallel program will reward individual departments with strong academic records and leading research teams . the deal also commits federal and state governments to boost the budgets of the big research associations by at least three percent annually until 2010 . chancellor gerhard schröder , who is expected to face a tough battle for re-election in september , spoke of " a good day for german science . " stemming the brain drain bildunterschrift : with several studies in recent years stating that the german educational system is trailing behind internationally , the opposition conservatives said the extra funding was needed to stop an ongoing brain drain from german universities . " i 'd just like to remind people that around 100 thousand top students are leaving the country , " said the christian social union leader edmund stoiber , " and two-thirds of them will never return .
we can not afford to allow this mass exodus to continue .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there .

but a new report suggests the heyday is almost over . say what you will about michael o 'leary and his irish discount airline , ryanair , there is no getting away from the fact that he will go down in history as an aviation trend-setter . in dispensing with the luxury and frills of flying , he was scorned by the likes of major-league elitist players such as british airways and lufthansa , but that did n't stop him from opening the skies to millions of mortal europeans and spawning a whole fleet of airlines eager to follow his lead .
now the taunting has stopped . there are some 65 discount airlines , 15 of them in germany , whose paths now cross mid-air as they make their daily runs to destinations all over the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have revolutionized holiday-making last year some 20 million passengers took advantage of the cheap seat offers , and the number this year is expected to rise to some 30 million .
the statistics all point in a positive direction for this booming industry , but mckinsey management consultants , who presented a study on the discount airlines boom in frankfurt on thursday , say the upward trend is made of fragile stuff . creating demand " their big plus has been that they are operating in newly created markets .
they went to markets when there was no demand and they created a demand .
only about a third of customers have come from more established airlines , all the rest come have been pulled off the street , so to speak .

it was a profitable departure for the company , which does n't think the situation is yet as drastic as mckinsey suggests . " the market wo n't get any easier for the airlines .
it will be up to each low-cost airline itself to establish its own place on the market .
they 're already beginning to offer different products and pricing systems in a bid to attract a particular customer segment , " pompeo said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair chief executive michael o 'leary low-budget airlines no longer only offer flights , but increasingly try to lure money out of travellers ' pockets with special hotel , car rental or insurance deals .

but two new releases in germany deal with a very real horror , the holocaust .
some question if the subject is appropriate for the format . most adults probably remember " wham ! "
" pow ! " or " zzzzzzttt ! " from the colorful comic books of their childhoods .
often the stories would climax with the superhero , usually in a skintight leotard , giving the murderous villain a powerful uppercut or a blast from a power ray , thus saving the world from imminent destruction . but the reader opening one of the two comic books or " graphic novels " which recently hit bookstores in germany , is confronted by a starkly different set of pictures : emaciated figures populating a landscape of barbed wire , sadistic guards and gas chambers ; faces etched with terror , but set with determination as they prepare to rise up against their persecutors and go to certain death . the stories are not set on some distant planet or in centuries from the past , they deal with a real event of the 20th century , the holocaust . two approaches auschwitz , drawn by frenchman pascal croci , presents a graphic account of life in the notorious death camp where an estimated one to one-and-a-half million people lost their lives , mostly jews .
croci has chosen to the tell the story from the perspective of a fictional married couple in the former yugoslavia in 1993 , as the country finds itself torn apart by civil war . they are about to be put to death for treason , but before the executioners come , they begin to think back on their time in auschwitz and the loss of their only daughter there .
it 's a subject they had suppressed for nearly half a century . bildunterschrift : a page from " auschwitz " by pascal croci croci 's talents as an artist are admirable .
he has depicted a world of grey , devoid of vegetation , and those humans still living are but walking ghosts , with sharp , angular features and prominent , haunted eyes .
his pictures are realistic but stylized , with a steely aestheticism that reminds one of the cold blade of a knife .
croci spares the reader little in terms of presentation of the horror of the camp , showing a gas chamber filled with dead bodies and jewish prisoners forced to carry them to mass graves for burning . the second book , yossel , by american arist joe kubert , uses a different technique to address the terror of that time .
his story largely takes place in the warsaw ghetto and ends with the courageous , but ultimately futile uprising of the polish jews there .
the book centers on a 16-year-old boy who is moved to the ghetto with his family and becomes a resistance fighter , all the while documenting his experiences through drawings . whereas croci uses traditional comic book narrative and structural form in telling his story , kubert breaks out of that , using pencil sketches , some only half-finished , scattered across the page that provide stunning snap-shots into the daily humiliations and hardships of the ghetto 's prisoners . bildunterschrift : a page out of " yossel " by joe kubert the sketches have something of the look and feel of the kind done by a court reporter , and they give his book a more documentary feel . still , it , along with croci 's work , are both fiction based on reality .
croci was born years after the holocaust , in 1961 , but spent five years researching the topic and talking with eyewitnesses .
kubert 's family eimgrated from poland to america in 1926 , and his account explores what might have happened if his parents had decided to stay in the country of their birth . appropriate ? while both treat the matter with gravity and respect , in germany , there are voices asking if it is right to depict the holocaust in comic book form .
a few jewish groups have expressed concerns that the format could minimize the seriousness of the subject .
others have worried that right-wing extremists could want to add the books to their collections . " we will have to watch very carefully indeed whether this kind of treatment really does address the people it is aimed for , " said paul spiegel , chairman of germany 's central council of jews . bildunterschrift : a page from " yossel " but according to alexandra germann , an editor in charge of graphic novels at ehapa , the publisher behind both works , graphic novels are exactly the vehicle to reach people who might have little knowledge of the holocaust . " they could especially bring younger people to a topic that they might not have looked at so closely in the past , or even adults , who for some reason have blocked it out or need a new way to find a connection with it , " she said . she points out that both works have been researched intensely .
croci spent five years preparing before he actually drew the novel , interviewing eyewitnesses and getting their approval before drawing the more ghastly scenes such as those in the gas chambers or at the mass graves .
kubert also spoke with survivors and used historic photographs as the basis for many of the scenes . groundbreaking " maus " depicting the holocaust in comic form would have been unthinkable for decades following world war two .
but in the early 1990s , american artist art spiegelman broke new , and controversial , ground with his graphic novel " maus . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " maus " by art spiegelman spiegelman recounted the holocaust using the recollections of his father , vladek , and presented events using anthropomorphic animals .
the jews were mice , the nazis , cats , and the poles , pigs .
he won the pulitzer prize in 1993 for the book . that book has been widely praised in the ensuing years , but it has not made the topic of holocaust representation any less sensitive and opinions are as varied as the people presenting them .
some have criticized spiegelman 's animal work as -lrb- literally -rrb- dehumanizing the holocaust , while some critics in germany of these two recent works have said the animal metaphors made an incomprehensible subject more understandable .
they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there .

they say the authenticity strived for in these recent graphic novels , especially croci 's , is problematic , since comics ' strengths do not lie in documentation and realism , rather in interpretation , reducation and abstraction . " -lsb- croci 's book -rsb- is ‘ over-aestheticized ' and does not really succeed in presenting the horror of the death camps even in its full-page drawings .
i think ‘ yossel ' works in that it presents smaller , individual pictures that better communicate the experiences of individual people , " andreas platthaus , a critic at the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , told german public radio . still there are many , even in the jewish community , who say a graphic presentation of the holocaust can be powerful and affect some people in our image-dominated world more than the printed word . " these books have been able to translate the events into visual form quite well , " said christian böhme , deputy editor of germany 's largest jewish newspaper , the jüdische allgemeine zeitung .
" i understand some people have been concerned , but from my reading of them , despite the fact that they 're comics , the real horror of what happened is still there .

tim darvill has found what he thinks is an ancient quarry at carn menyn high in the preseli hills of pembrokeshire .
the bluestones - which form the inner circle of stonehenge - were transported over 240 miles to salisbury plain .
local archaeologists say professor darvill had made a " convincing and compelling " argument .
when you stand up on the site you can see what kind of hold and significance it would have had for prehistoric man gwilym hughes , cambria archaeology writing in the july / august issue of british archaeology , he describes the very spot from which be says the stones were quarried centuries ago .
he believes there is evidence at the site that it was used as a prehistoric quarry .
added to that the rock formations there are identical to those of the bluestones and the location of the quarry meant it would have been prized source of stone .
earlier this year he and his colleague geoff wainwright led a field expedition to the site , which he describes as " a veritable aladdin 's cave of made-to-measure pillars for aspiring circle builders " .
he describes a " small crag-edged promontory with a stone bank across its neck " and measuring less than half a hectare as the exact location .
" three things are clear from just looking around the site , " he said .
" first , those outcrops have been exploited as a source of stone for a long time and much has been taken away .
" second , our understanding of what a ' quarry ' is perhaps needs to be modified because here the extraction of pillars simply involves leavening suitably shaped but naturally detached blocks from the ground or a fractured outcrop .
professor darvill led fieldwork at the site in april " and third , the remoteness of the place and its mountain top situation invite comparison with other known sources of prized stone , exploited for axe heads during the fourth and third millennia bc . "
gwilym hughes , director of cambria archaeology , the south west wales archaeological trust , said mr darvill still had some work to do to prove his theory beyond doubt .
but he said : " they have put forward a very reasoned argument which i found very convincing and very compelling .
" when you stand up on the site you can see what kind of hold and significance it would have had for prehistoric man , it 's got a kind of aura about it .
" there are alternative theories put forward for the arrival of the bluestones at salisbury hill including the possibility they have been taken there by natural forces such as glaciers .
" personally i would like to think they have been taken there by human action . "

tim darvill has found what he thinks is an ancient quarry at carn menyn high in the preseli hills of pembrokeshire .
the bluestones - which form the inner circle of stonehenge - were transported over 240 miles to salisbury plain .
local archaeologists say professor darvill had made a " convincing and compelling " argument .
when you stand up on the site you can see what kind of hold and significance it would have had for prehistoric man gwilym hughes , cambria archaeology writing in the july / august issue of british archaeology , he describes the very spot from which be says the stones were quarried centuries ago .
he believes there is evidence at the site that it was used as a prehistoric quarry .
added to that the rock formations there are identical to those of the bluestones and the location of the quarry meant it would have been prized source of stone .
earlier this year he and his colleague geoff wainwright led a field expedition to the site , which he describes as " a veritable aladdin 's cave of made-to-measure pillars for aspiring circle builders " .
he describes a " small crag-edged promontory with a stone bank across its neck " and measuring less than half a hectare as the exact location .
" three things are clear from just looking around the site , " he said .
" first , those outcrops have been exploited as a source of stone for a long time and much has been taken away .
" second , our understanding of what a ' quarry ' is perhaps needs to be modified because here the extraction of pillars simply involves leavening suitably shaped but naturally detached blocks from the ground or a fractured outcrop .
professor darvill led fieldwork at the site in april " and third , the remoteness of the place and its mountain top situation invite comparison with other known sources of prized stone , exploited for axe heads during the fourth and third millennia bc . "
gwilym hughes , director of cambria archaeology , the south west wales archaeological trust , said mr darvill still had some work to do to prove his theory beyond doubt .
but he said : " they have put forward a very reasoned argument which i found very convincing and very compelling .
" when you stand up on the site you can see what kind of hold and significance it would have had for prehistoric man , it 's got a kind of aura about it .
" there are alternative theories put forward for the arrival of the bluestones at salisbury hill including the possibility they have been taken there by natural forces such as glaciers .
" personally i would like to think they have been taken there by human action . "

a report to the welsh local government association -lrb- wlga -rrb- admits road repairs have been neglected in recent years .
the report says that much of the extra money that authorities had received from the welsh assembly government has been spent on other areas .
an assembly government spokesperson said it was waiting to receive the final report .
a report carried out by the institute of civil engineers -lrb- ice -rrb- in 2003 , said that more than £ 1bn is needed to clear the backlog of repairs on rural and urban roads across wales .
rural and urban roads in wales are in a worse condition than those in england or scotland , according to the survey , with the most severe problems are on roads maintained by councils .
and the wlga said the current situation was " unsustainable " and that the continuing deterioration of roads was making repairs more expensive .
the association said it would urge the assembly government to find an extra £ 20m , which it said would only be the beginning of a programme of investment .
according to the wlga , extra money that wales ' 22 local authorities has received from the assembly government has been used to meet the increasing cost of teachers and growing numbers of people using social services .
in a statement , an assembly government spokesperson said : " we are yet to receive the final report of the expenditure sub group , which will then be considered by the local government minister -lrb- sue essex -rrb- . "
over the last three years , the assembly government has made £ 247m available in transport grants to local authorities .
of this , £ 149m has been drawn down , leaving approximately £ 100m unspent .
this money has remained with the assembly government . "
fairly massive investment is required to bring the network back up to the state where annual maintenance expenditure will keep on top of the job " dennis morgan , ice dennis morgan from ice said massive investment is vital for road improvements .
" over the last 20 years there has been a gradual deterioration of the stock of highways throughout the nation and we are at a point now where a fairly massive investment is required to bring the network back up to the state where annual maintenance expenditure will keep on top of the job , " he told bbc wales .
" i do n't think we can blame current policy makers in anyway - we are dealing with a 20 year backlog of successive under-investment in our highway system .
" it 's not something that has happened overnight , it is a gradual process that has built up and is now at the point where we require these large sums of money to solve the problem .
" traffic has dramatically increased over the last 20 years and this is putting greater and greater strain on the road system .
" the life of a road is directly proportional to the use it gets and when maintenance expenditure over this period of time has been under the levels it should have been , we get these cumulative problems that we now need a lot of money to get things back to normal . "
he said that additional expenditure for the roads needs to be made every year for the next 10 years in order to bring the roads back to standard .

a report to the welsh local government association -lrb- wlga -rrb- admits road repairs have been neglected in recent years .
the report says that much of the extra money that authorities had received from the welsh assembly government has been spent on other areas .
an assembly government spokesperson said it was waiting to receive the final report .
a report carried out by the institute of civil engineers -lrb- ice -rrb- in 2003 , said that more than £ 1bn is needed to clear the backlog of repairs on rural and urban roads across wales .
rural and urban roads in wales are in a worse condition than those in england or scotland , according to the survey , with the most severe problems are on roads maintained by councils .
and the wlga said the current situation was " unsustainable " and that the continuing deterioration of roads was making repairs more expensive .
there has been a gradual deterioration in the highways the association said it would urge the assembly government to find an extra £ 20m , which it said would only be the beginning of a programme of investment .
according to the wlga , extra money that wales ' 22 local authorities has received from the assembly government has been used to meet the increasing cost of teachers and growing numbers of people using social services .
in a statement , an assembly government spokesperson said : " we are yet to receive the final report of the expenditure sub group , which will then be considered by the local government minister -lrb- sue essex -rrb- . "
over the last three years , the assembly government has made £ 247m available in transport grants to local authorities .
of this , £ 149m has been drawn down , leaving approximately £ 100m unspent .
this money has remained with the assembly government .
fairly massive investment is required to bring the network back up to the state where annual maintenance expenditure will keep on top of the job dennis morgan , ice dennis morgan from ice said massive investment is vital for road improvements .
" over the last 20 years there has been a gradual deterioration of the stock of highways throughout the nation and we are at a point now where a fairly massive investment is required to bring the network back up to the state where annual maintenance expenditure will keep on top of the job , " he told bbc wales .
" i do n't think we can blame current policy makers in anyway - we are dealing with a 20 year backlog of successive under-investment in our highway system .
" it 's not something that has happened overnight , it is a gradual process that has built up and is now at the point where we require these large sums of money to solve the problem .
" traffic has dramatically increased over the last 20 years and this is putting greater and greater strain on the road system .
" the life of a road is directly proportional to the use it gets and when maintenance expenditure over this period of time has been under the levels it should have been , we get these cumulative problems that we now need a lot of money to get things back to normal . "
he said that additional expenditure for the roads needs to be made every year for the next 10 years in order to bring the roads back to standard .

the quay hotel in deganwy is the final part of a £ 46m new marina development on the river conwy .
it will have 74 suites , including five penthouses , a 128-seat restaurant , luxury spa and pool and an art deco-style interior .
tourism bosses hope it will help the north wales economy by improving the standards of accommodation on offer .
dewi davies , the director of tourism partnership north wales , said the area needed more top quality hotels .

is it really needed and will it really bring the jobs into the area which they say it will ? "
john lowe " that brings in higher-spending customers , and higher spending customers lead to higher quality jobs in the industry . "

" there is a big need for high quality hotels in this area , " he said .
" there is a big push to bring the big conferences back to llandudno , and one of the big shortfalls was the lack of quality accommodation . "
mr waldron said the hotel , which is due to open in june 2006 , would be the " jewel in the crown " of the marina development , which includes a number of waterside homes .
he added : " deganwy quay is set to re-establish itself as an integral part of community life , bringing a further 100 jobs to the area and added income to the locality due to the influx of hotel guests , visitors to the marina and home owners " .
but john lowe , who lives in deganwy , said the local community had not benefited from the new marina , and wondered if the hotel would be any different .
he said : " is it really needed and will it really bring the jobs into the area which they say it will ?
" at the moment the marina development is not bringing much into the village as such . "
however , developers have claimed opposition to the hotel is minimal .
in 2003 , the hotel project received a £ 650,000 grant from the wales tourist board .

chinese premier wen jiabao presented mr tsang with his appointment letter as chief executive of the territory .
mr tsang , 60 , is a former civil servant popular with hong kong 's public .
he has been serving as acting chief executive since tung chee-hwa resigned in march .
his appointment will run for the next two years , until the end of mr tung 's original term of office .
an election will be held in 2007 .
mr tsang , wearing his customary bow-tie , told a press conference after the inauguration that he would work hard for hong kong 's future .
" thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve the hong kong people and the country , " he said .
donald tsang knighted for work during british colonial rule before 1997 mostly held financial posts , and became first chinese to be financial secretary popular with public but loyal to beijing test of style or substance profile : donald tsang according to china 's official xinhua news agency , mr wen quoted an old chinese saying to mr tsang : " the task is arduous and the road ahead is long " .
popular support mr tsang was appointed chief executive after he won nominations from 710 of the 800 election committee members .
his success in the leadership contest was never in doubt , because of his experience and the fact he had beijing 's backing .
but he was keen to gain the overwhelming support of the election committee , to gain a mandate .
polls show mr tsang enjoys public support of more than 70 % , a stark contrast to the unpopular tung chee-hwa , who stepped down citing health worries .
many in the territory feel that the chinese mainland wields too much power and stifles the high degree of autonomy it was promised when britain handed it back to china in 1997 .
it can not directly elect its own leader , and beijing can effectively veto any changes to its political system .
