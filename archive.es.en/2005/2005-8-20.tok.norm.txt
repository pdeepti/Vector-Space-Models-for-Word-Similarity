experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .

fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .

experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .
there is also considerable experience in the production of flu vaccines , particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in circulating virus due to mutation .
however , at least four months would be needed to produce a new vaccine , in significant quantities , that is capable of protecting against a new virus subtype . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu virus wings westwards as bird flu spreads across russia , authorities confirmed the outbreak is the same strain of the disease that caused human deaths in asia .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .
indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2005 pope mingles with german politicians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's here to preach not to politicize pope benedict xvi took time out of his world youth day schedule to hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger in the sept .
18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .
indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .
better to wait ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg habor german frustration with schröder 's government is largely based on its inability to bring down the country 's chronic unemployment . the economy , once again , stagnated in the second quarter .
however , according to the latest edition of the economist , germany might finally be on the verge of a substantial recovery .
were that true , schröder might have been in a much better position to win re-election in the fall of 2006 .
with that in mind , i 'd probably say calling the early election was n't such a great idea .
voters might have been more willing to accept schröder 's welfare cuts and labor market reforms . but hindsight , of course , is a luxury not afforded to politicians when they make tough choices .
in may , schröder clearly decided the only way to get a mandate for his agenda of unpopular economic reform was to go to voters .
victory at the polls would both silence his internal party critics and encourage the conservative opposition - which controls the upper house - to work with him and not against him .
and that 's why i still respect schröder 's bold springtime gamble , even if it ends up costing him his job . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de surprise good review for german economy one of the world 's most prominent business magazines has given the german economy the thumbs up .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .

he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace .

" " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .

polish commuters welcome fears that rich germans would storm into poland following eu enlargement and buy up properties appear unfounded .
houses are being bought , but it 's the poles who are finding deals - in east germany . situated right on the german frontier , and poised to serve as a gateway to scandinavia , the port city of szczecin has played its cards right in the past fifteen years . the collapse of the old east germany has been a boon to local businessmen , who have made fortunes off of germans crossing the border in search of cheaper goods and services .
but when those businessmen started looking around for property to buy , they found themselves priced out of their own market .
their solution ?
cross the border into eastern germany . " before poland joined the eu , the nation ’ s biggest fear was the invasion of germans buying land they could purchase for half the price of land in their own country , " said iwona lejman , a polish journalist .
" however , in the szczecin area the trend is going totally in the opposite direction .
the german side is poor and depressed … -lrb- and -rrb- seeing an exodus of young people looking for jobs and a better life .
they leave behind their old and empty houses . " a german suburb for a polish city now those empty properties are getting snatched up by polish businessmen , a surprising twist in the developing saga of european enlargement .
rather than the " drang nach osten " -lrb- drive to the east -rrb- a popular slogan of the former east german communist government , poles jokingly refer to it as the " drang nach westen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szczecin : nice town , a little pricey though for restaurateur tomasz pawlik , the price he paid for a home in the small town of wetzenau on the german side of the polish border is well worth the 25-kilometer drive from his modern restaurant in the center of the city of 400,000 .
" everybody associates our move to germany with leaving poland for good , " said pawlik , who bought a house formerly built for a lutheran minister with his artist girlfriend .
" but in fact out village of wetzenau is more like a suburb of szczecin . " local officials welcoming polish business rather than complain about the buyers from the east , local town officials are embracing their business .

but industry analysts are scratching their heads over why the gaming industry in general in germany has n't taken off . organizers were thrilled at the numbers of visitors on the first day of the games convention - some 28,000 came to view the very latest in computer gaming technology , 75 percent more than did last year .
but those numbers do n't necessarily reflect a growth in the sector in germany . in fact , many of the visitors are less than pleased about the general state of gaming in germany , which lags far behind other big economies such as the united states and japan . " we have some way to catch up , to put it mildly , " josef rahmen , the fair 's director , said at news conference .

that is a 15 percent increase over the previous year , but still a drop in the bucket compared to the 21 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- spent worldwide on video game software and hardware every year . makes kids stupid ? germany 's reluctance to spend on video games could be partly due to widespread perceptions in the country among older people that playing video games makes young people stupid , according to gerhard florin , european manager of the world 's biggest games software company , electronic arts . " i 'm often asked when i 'm abroad , in connection with our industry : ' what is wrong with the germans ? " ' he said during the fair 's keynote speech . florin blamed the negative attitudes about video gaming on ignorance , saying germany was in need of a public education campaign .
otherwise , he said , the country could find itself in a cultural backwater . " germany is really a special case due to our history .
our government is always making excuses for what happened 60 years ago , " said manfred gerdes , managing director of sony germany , referring to the country 's nazi past .

" german mothers are the gatekeepers , and they have a very low tolerance for violent video games , " said the head spokesperson for electronic arts , the world 's biggest video games maker . pushing for more acceptance in fact , fair organizers have enlisted two organizations , a federal gaming association and children 's charity of germany , to help campaign for more video game acceptance .
the fair has a family-themed section where parents can look at the latest in education-oriented gaming software . psychologist bernd friedrich , who played a colorful african animals game at the fair , defended video games , saying he used computer games to teach students with learning difficulties in two children 's homes where he works . he added that games gave children an opportunity to question things and learn in an interactive way . bildunterschrift : dirk hoeschen , a spokesman for children 's charity , said there was a lack of computer awareness among german schoolchildren that was to blame for the games industry 's weakness .

" it 's not bad to read books but it 's just as good to play games . " he and other organizers say they do n't only want german kids to play more games and the market to open up ; they also hope the german economy will benefit from gaming .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .
billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .
the office will also serve as a platform for a national it security crisis center to be built up over the next few years .
the center would be responsible for coordinating measures against planned large-scale attacks on the nation 's it infrastructure . preventing terrorist attacks schily specifically pinpointed a need to increase efforts to ward off or deal with major attacks on the energy , transport and banking sectors .
" i 'm not saying that we have any specific indications right now that terrorist groupings are already planning such attacks in germany .
but if such attacks hit us unaware , they would no doubt cause major damage and would have repercussions beyond our national borders , " schily told reporters . the federal office 's director udo helmbrecht said that while terrorist attacks could not be entirely ruled out , most of his organization 's efforts at the moment were going into campaigns to raise public awareness to help users cope with the security pitfalls of modern computer systems . " our office is currently working out comprehensive guidelines for the safe use of wireless networking and voice-over-ip telephony as well as instructions on how to fight spam mails , " helmbrecht said .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .
if they do not , he warned , the world will be exposed to " the darkness of a new barbarism . " stressing inter-religious dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi visits the cologne synagogue the 78-year-old benedict , who met with jewish leaders in a cologne synagogue on friday and warned against the development of new forms of anti-semitism , has made inter-religious relations one of the goals of his papacy .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .

the office will also serve as a platform for a national it security crisis center to be built up over the next few years .
the center would be responsible for coordinating measures against planned large-scale attacks on the nation 's it infrastructure . preventing terrorist attacks schily specifically pinpointed a need to increase efforts to ward off or deal with major attacks on the energy , transport and banking sectors .
" i 'm not saying that we have any specific indications right now that terrorist groupings are already planning such attacks in germany .
but if such attacks hit us unaware , they would no doubt cause major damage and would have repercussions beyond our national borders , " schily told reporters . the federal office 's director udo helmbrecht said that while terrorist attacks could not be entirely ruled out , most of his organization 's efforts at the moment were going into campaigns to raise public awareness to help users cope with the security pitfalls of modern computer systems . " our office is currently working out comprehensive guidelines for the safe use of wireless networking and voice-over-ip telephony as well as instructions on how to fight spam mails , " helmbrecht said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the westward migration of bird flu bird flu reaches europe fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds germans move to prevent bird flu eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 20.08.2005 what is bird flu ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain of the bird flu virus under the microspcope primarily affecting birds , the avian influenza virus can infect humans who come into in close contact with infected animals .
experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .

experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .

" i know at least three priests who have season tickets for eintracht frankfurt .
we want to do more than set up a few television screens in our centers . " world cup services planned and prayers offered offering quiet places of reflection and spiritual guidance will only be part of the plan , according to ekd officials .

we would be delighted if the world cup helps to revive the relationship between the german national team and the church . "

" after the 4-1 defeat against leverkusen last season i drafted in players who are strong at winning tackles , " confirmed magath .
" ali did that and his attacking approach pleases me too . " respected magazine kicker voted karimi in the team of the weekend and the midfielder could hardly contain his joy at scoring on his full bundesliga debut . karimi growing in confidence with bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i am getting stronger and my first bundesliga goal gives me a lot of confidence , " enthused karimi .
" i hope the coach and fans are happy with me , although that was not me at 100 percent .
there is more to come . " with bayern leading 2-1 karimi showed good composure to volley home in the 35th minute after dutch international roy makaay had won the ball at the back post . karimi came off in the 58th minute for brazilian international ze roberto but a warm ovation from the traveling munich fans showed their appreciation for his contribution . previous bad experiences of iranians at munich bayern have had bad experiences with iranian internationals in the past with striking pair ali daei and vahid hashemian disappearing without a trace .
iran legend daei , the first man to score 100 goals at international level , was handpicked by west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer in 1998 , but moved on a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hashemian fared little better leaving the club this season after failing to make an impact following a two million euro move from vfl bochum last summer . " maybe the other iranian players did not have that little bit of luck at bayern , " said karimi .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

the miss-matched tie on friday evening offered few surprises with the bundesliga outfit putting four past the youth team without reply . vahid hashemian , the iranian international signed by hanover from bayern munich , opened the scoring in the sixth minute .
hanover finished the game at a stroll after cologne 's tobias nickenig was sent off midway through the first half and completed the rout with goals from thomas brdaric , chavdar yankov and jiri stajner . the other top league side in action on friday was recently promoted eintracht frankfurt who won in less comfortable circumstances against rot-weiss oberhausen , holding on to a 2-1 victory for their first win of the season . new signings benjamin huggel and ioannis amanatidis put frankfurt 2-0 up before dalibor gataric 's reply 13 minutes from time set up a nervous finale . cottbus keeper the saviour and hero the pick of the other six matches was the cliff-hanger between second division energie cottbus and amateurs rot-weiss essen which finished in favor of the professionals from the east after a dramatic penalty shoot-out which cottbus won 5-4 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian faruk hujdurovic , left , brazilian vragel da silva , center , and bosnian keeper tomislav piplica , right , of cottbus .
the hero of the night was energie 's bosnian goalkeeper tomislav piplica -lrb- photo , right -rrb- who saved from lennart lynge larsen at 4-4 in the shootout before scoring the winner himself . high-flying hamburg sv will be well aware of the significance of their cup tie against stuttgarter kickers , one of 13 games being played on saturday .
it is one year since they were dumped out of the competition last season by corrupt referee robert hoyzer . memory of fixed match wo n't hamper hamburg hamburg lost 4-2 away to sc paderborn , after conceding two penalties and having belgian striker emile mpenza sent off in a match that was fixed by hoyzer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even though a european place is at stake for hamburg when they defend a 1-0 lead at valencia in the intertoto cup on tuesday , the memory of that fateful game last year will not stop coach thomas doll putting out a strong side . “ we ’ ll be going in at full strength , ” doll said .
“ i was an amateur coach myself for a while and this sort of match provides these clubs with their match of the season . ”
hamburg will see the draw for the first round as an extremely good omen .
hamburg beat stuttgarter kickers 3-1 in the final of the cup in 1987 .
hamburg 's opponents in the now notorious match , paderborn , are also back in action on saturday against vfl wolfsburg and will be eager to prove they can provide another upset , this time without any external assistance .
paderborn enter the game against the wolves on the back of a 5-0 league win in the second division and confidence is high .
top teams facing minnows know the pitfalls bildunterschrift : cologne 's lukas podolski , center , challenges for the ball with mainz 's nikolce noveski from macedonia , right , and fabian gerber during the german first division soccer match between fc cologne and mainz 05 at the rheinenergie stadium in cologne on the opening day of the season . fc cologne could face a sticky time against kickers offenbach in their cup match on saturday .
lukas podolski and co. have won both their games in the league so far and are riding a tide of fanatical support and optimism which should see them negotiate the potentially tricky offenbach . the cup holders bayern munich begin their defense of the trophy against amateurs msv 1919 neuruppin in one of ten games being played on sunday .
munich , who beat schalke 04 in last season ’ s final to complete a league and cup double , have an easy start to their campaign and after hitting bayer leverkusen for five last weekend , neuruppin will be well advised to play ten defenders in front of their goalkeeper . borussia dortmund complete the first-round action at eintracht braunschweig on monday in a match that has embarrassing slip-up written all over it .

according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .

"
the german soccer team are being inundated with offers of divine guidance during the world cup .
the protestant church wants to set up special prayer centers while the evangelists want to install a priest with the squad . it was revealed this week that germany 's protestant churches are planning to hold late-night services during next year 's world cup to allow supporters to come in at all times to pray for their team , amongst other things . leaders of germany 's protestant church association -lrb- ekd -rrb- have said that two clergymen would spend the next 10 months preparing the ground for the initiative which the church organization hopes will improve links with soccer fans . " the sport of soccer fascinates people and the members of our community , " said pastor hans-joachim fischer in an interview with reuters .
" i know at least three priests who have season tickets for eintracht frankfurt .
we want to do more than set up a few television screens in our centers . " world cup services planned and prayers offered offering quiet places of reflection and spiritual guidance will only be part of the plan , according to ekd officials .
the churches also plan special world cup services and will offer facilities for soccer fans to pray on their own . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ekd plans to contact church organizations in the 32 competing countries and also hope to get involved with local organizing committees at germany 's 12 world cup venues , which include berlin , munich , hamburg , cologne and frankfurt . the church needs to pay more attention to the sport and integrate it more into its daily work , " fischer said .
" the world cup offers a first-class opportunity to build these bridges . " team priest wants to inspire germany to glory meanwhile , as the ekd continues to set up the initiative which will allow supporters to call on divine help in bring world cup glory to their country , the evangelist church is offering a more direct link to the heavenly power .
the church has offered to provide a priest to help klinsmann ’ s team achieve their goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are ready to offer the players and the management spiritual assistance for the world cup , ” explained hans-georg ulrichs , the official evangelist church world cup priest . “ the dfb -lrb- german football federation -rrb- and the german management team have been informed of our offer .
we would be delighted if the world cup helps to revive the relationship between the german national team and the church . "
predecessors blessed by divine intervention klinsmann may see religion as a good omen with predecessor helmut schön using a church representative the last time germany hosted the world cup back in 1974 . west germany went on to win the tournament defeating a johan cruyff-inspired holland team 2-1 in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the 1990 world cup west germany ’ s manager franz beckenbauer also elected to have a member of the church accompany his team in italy and they won the trophy again . klinsmann was part of that winning team and is not afraid of calling on help from outside having already recruited a sports psychologist for the first time in the country ’ s history . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany face world cup with optimism after crashing out of euro 2004 , germany were just glad to have qualified for the 2006 world cup as hosts but now there is a genuine belief that they can lift the trophy .

" after the 4-1 defeat against leverkusen last season i drafted in players who are strong at winning tackles , " confirmed magath .
" ali did that and his attacking approach pleases me too .

" i hope the coach and fans are happy with me , although that was not me at 100 percent .
there is more to come . " with bayern leading 2-1 karimi showed good composure to volley home in the 35th minute after dutch international roy makaay had won the ball at the back post . karimi came off in the 58th minute for brazilian international ze roberto but a warm ovation from the traveling munich fans showed their appreciation for his contribution . previous bad experiences of iranians at munich bayern have had bad experiences with iranian internationals in the past with striking pair ali daei and vahid hashemian disappearing without a trace .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .
indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .
better to wait ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg habor german frustration with schröder 's government is largely based on its inability to bring down the country 's chronic unemployment . the economy , once again , stagnated in the second quarter .
however , according to the latest edition of the economist , germany might finally be on the verge of a substantial recovery .
were that true , schröder might have been in a much better position to win re-election in the fall of 2006 .
with that in mind , i 'd probably say calling the early election was n't such a great idea .
voters might have been more willing to accept schröder 's welfare cuts and labor market reforms . but hindsight , of course , is a luxury not afforded to politicians when they make tough choices .
in may , schröder clearly decided the only way to get a mandate for his agenda of unpopular economic reform was to go to voters .
victory at the polls would both silence his internal party critics and encourage the conservative opposition - which controls the upper house - to work with him and not against him .
and that 's why i still respect schröder 's bold springtime gamble , even if it ends up costing him his job . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de surprise good review for german economy one of the world 's most prominent business magazines has given the german economy the thumbs up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2005 pope calls on muslims to fight terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we must eliminate intolerance and violence from our hearts " pope benedict xvi urged muslim leaders to join christians to help defeat the intolerance which he said was at the root of the terrorist violence seeking to poison ties between the two religions . at a gathering of germany 's muslim officials , the leader of the catholic church on saturday decried the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism and called out to muslims to join christians in trying to combat its spread . " i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .
if they do not , he warned , the world will be exposed to " the darkness of a new barbarism . " stressing inter-religious dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi visits the cologne synagogue the 78-year-old benedict , who met with jewish leaders in a cologne synagogue on friday and warned against the development of new forms of anti-semitism , has made inter-religious relations one of the goals of his papacy .
he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany , echoed the pope 's message of reconciliation in his speech : " the islamic world also needs to recognize its historic guilt and prepare for a new constructive beginning . " " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .
teaching is the vehicle through which ideas and convictions are transmitted .
words are highly influential in the education of the mind .
you therefore have a great responsibility for the formation of the younger generation , " he said . early in the day , the pope was reported to have told german politicians he was in favor of introducing islamic instruction into the german school curriculum as an equal to the currently catholic and protestant religion courses provided .
when the classes are offered in german in the schools , the instruction is conducted by state-trained teachers with material authorized by state educational authorities . at the moment only three federal states offer islam as an official school religion course , leaving the majority of the country 's 3.2 million muslims to turn to private -lrb- non-state supervised -rrb- koran schools for religious education .
several german bishops have called for placing islam on an equal footing with christianity in schools as a means to help integrate muslim children and control fundamentalist teaching . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope mingles with german politicians pope benedict xvi took time out of his world youth day schedule to hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger in the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.08.2005 video gaming in germany lags behind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german parents worry about their kids playing video games europe 's biggest computer gaming trade fair , currently on in leipzig , is drawing in record crowds .
but industry analysts are scratching their heads over why the gaming industry in general in germany has n't taken off . organizers were thrilled at the numbers of visitors on the first day of the games convention - some 28,000 came to view the very latest in computer gaming technology , 75 percent more than did last year .
but those numbers do n't necessarily reflect a growth in the sector in germany . in fact , many of the visitors are less than pleased about the general state of gaming in germany , which lags far behind other big economies such as the united states and japan . " we have some way to catch up , to put it mildly , " josef rahmen , the fair 's director , said at news conference .
" it 's a very important industry , and we should n't leave it all to our american , japanese and english friends . " bildunterschrift : a human lara croft double from " tomb raider " poses at the trade fair only around one in 10 households in germany , europe 's biggest but slowest-growing economy , has a video game console as opposed to about one in three in the united states , the world 's largest video game market . it is a big business in germany , where , according to fair organizers , people spent 466 million euros -lrb- $ 567 million -rrb- on video games in 2004 .
that is a 15 percent increase over the previous year , but still a drop in the bucket compared to the 21 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- spent worldwide on video game software and hardware every year . makes kids stupid ? germany 's reluctance to spend on video games could be partly due to widespread perceptions in the country among older people that playing video games makes young people stupid , according to gerhard florin , european manager of the world 's biggest games software company , electronic arts . " i 'm often asked when i 'm abroad , in connection with our industry : ' what is wrong with the germans ? " ' he said during the fair 's keynote speech . florin blamed the negative attitudes about video gaming on ignorance , saying germany was in need of a public education campaign .
otherwise , he said , the country could find itself in a cultural backwater . " germany is really a special case due to our history .
our government is always making excuses for what happened 60 years ago , " said manfred gerdes , managing director of sony germany , referring to the country 's nazi past .
" people hate violent games . "
bildunterschrift : fair visitors playing " resident evil " in leipzig teenagers and young adults are the key target audience for video-game markers , but industry experts say parents often wo n't allow money to be spent on the games and consoles , including sony 's playstation 2 , microsoft 's xbox , or nintendo 's gamecube .
" german mothers are the gatekeepers , and they have a very low tolerance for violent video games , " said the head spokesperson for electronic arts , the world 's biggest video games maker . pushing for more acceptance in fact , fair organizers have enlisted two organizations , a federal gaming association and children 's charity of germany , to help campaign for more video game acceptance .
the fair has a family-themed section where parents can look at the latest in education-oriented gaming software . psychologist bernd friedrich , who played a colorful african animals game at the fair , defended video games , saying he used computer games to teach students with learning difficulties in two children 's homes where he works . he added that games gave children an opportunity to question things and learn in an interactive way . bildunterschrift : dirk hoeschen , a spokesman for children 's charity , said there was a lack of computer awareness among german schoolchildren that was to blame for the games industry 's weakness . " it 's impossible to understand why computers are n't used in kindergartens , " he told ap , adding that german school 's placed too high a regard for the book over other media . gerhard florin from electronic arts advocated a mixed approach .
" it 's not bad to read books but it 's just as good to play games . " he and other organizers say they do n't only want german kids to play more games and the market to open up ; they also hope the german economy will benefit from gaming .
right now , there are no major games software or hardware companies in germany . " it 's amazing how far behind we are as developers for this market , " malte behrmann , manager at g.a.m.e. , an association of german game developers , told ap . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video game fair spotlights european market the third computer games convention came to an end in leipzig on sunday with positive feedback for the future of the event itself but less than good news for the german gaming industry .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .
billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .

billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .

he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace .

" " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .
teaching is the vehicle through which ideas and convictions are transmitted .

but industry analysts are scratching their heads over why the gaming industry in general in germany has n't taken off . organizers were thrilled at the numbers of visitors on the first day of the games convention - some 28,000 came to view the very latest in computer gaming technology , 75 percent more than did last year .
but those numbers do n't necessarily reflect a growth in the sector in germany . in fact , many of the visitors are less than pleased about the general state of gaming in germany , which lags far behind other big economies such as the united states and japan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2005 pope calls on muslims to fight terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we must eliminate intolerance and violence from our hearts " pope benedict xvi urged muslim leaders to join christians to help defeat the intolerance which he said was at the root of the terrorist violence seeking to poison ties between the two religions . at a gathering of germany 's muslim officials , the leader of the catholic church on saturday decried the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism and called out to muslims to join christians in trying to combat its spread . " i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .
if they do not , he warned , the world will be exposed to " the darkness of a new barbarism . " stressing inter-religious dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi visits the cologne synagogue the 78-year-old benedict , who met with jewish leaders in a cologne synagogue on friday and warned against the development of new forms of anti-semitism , has made inter-religious relations one of the goals of his papacy .
he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany , echoed the pope 's message of reconciliation in his speech : " the islamic world also needs to recognize its historic guilt and prepare for a new constructive beginning . " " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .
teaching is the vehicle through which ideas and convictions are transmitted .
words are highly influential in the education of the mind .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .

he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace .

" " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

dortmund have the highest average attendance in europe , several thousand better than spanish titans real madrid and barcelona , and other host cities for the 2006 world cup are not far behind . bayern munich 's 340 million euro -lrb- $ 413m -rrb- allianz arena enjoyed a capacity 66,000 capacity crowd for the club 's opening 3-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach a fortnight ago . prices make german games attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admittedly the excitement of experiencing the atmosphere at the new arena is a major attraction , but maybe there is another reason why german stadiums are full - affordability .
in germany it seems younger people and the working classes can afford to watch their local club and ensure the stadiums are full . it 's a direct comparison to the english premier league where the most expensive season ticket for newly promoted sunderland will cost ₤ 445 -lrb- 657 euros -rrb- and the cheapest ₤ 110 -lrb- 162 euros -rrb- .
at schalke 04 , one of the top clubs in germany , offering their best season tickets at 192 euros . arsenal , a club of a similar standing in england , has the most expensive season tickets in europe at ₤ 885 -lrb- 1307 euros -rrb- , just over 1000 euros more than the most expensive german tickets , those at bayern munich . with tickets more affordable throughout germany , the hosts have a sense that the momentum can continue with crowds flocking to stadiums as the excitement heightens , culminating in huge numbers of expectant fans once the main event opens . atmosphere building as world cup approaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the atmosphere at the world cup stadiums , and indeed germany as a whole , is something special , " explained germany coach jürgen klinsmann .
" you can sense that there is big tournament just around the corner . " if the atmosphere in the bundesliga is mirrored in the 2006 world cup , running from june 9 to july 9 , players and fans can look forward to a football fest . but it is worth remembering that world cup tickets will be far from cheap and black market prices already range from 35 euros to 600 euros on auction site ebay . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bring on the world cup , germany says the confederations cup ended with a bang on wednesday with a masterclass display by brazil .

ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and bayern have offered a lucrative four-year extension but are growing impatient at the player 's reluctance to sign on the dotted line .

" bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . "
ballack joined bayern from bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2002 and said at the time he was not ready for a move abroad , but at 28 this could be his last chance to ply his trade in another league .
if ballack does shun bayern 's contract offer the club are likely to immediately put the german player of the year up for sale rather than risk losing him for nothing at the end of the campaign . dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and bayern have offered a lucrative four-year extension but are growing impatient at the player 's reluctance to sign on the dotted line .
" we want an answer by the end of september or beginning of october , " general manager uli hoeness told the abendzeitung .
" our offer is on the table .
there is no need for more negotiations .
he has to just say ' yes ' or ' no ' . "
german international captain ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client .
" bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . "
ballack joined bayern from bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2002 and said at the time he was not ready for a move abroad , but at 28 this could be his last chance to ply his trade in another league .
if ballack does shun bayern 's contract offer the club are likely to immediately put the german player of the year up for sale rather than risk losing him for nothing at the end of the campaign . dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?
following a sterling confederations cup performance the rumor mill is hot with transfer talks concerning germany 's only real soccer star .
but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ?

houses are being bought , but it 's the poles who are finding deals - in east germany . situated right on the german frontier , and poised to serve as a gateway to scandinavia , the port city of szczecin has played its cards right in the past fifteen years . the collapse of the old east germany has been a boon to local businessmen , who have made fortunes off of germans crossing the border in search of cheaper goods and services .
but when those businessmen started looking around for property to buy , they found themselves priced out of their own market .
their solution ?
cross the border into eastern germany . " before poland joined the eu , the nation ’ s biggest fear was the invasion of germans buying land they could purchase for half the price of land in their own country , " said iwona lejman , a polish journalist .
" however , in the szczecin area the trend is going totally in the opposite direction .
the german side is poor and depressed … -lrb- and -rrb- seeing an exodus of young people looking for jobs and a better life .
they leave behind their old and empty houses . " a german suburb for a polish city now those empty properties are getting snatched up by polish businessmen , a surprising twist in the developing saga of european enlargement .
rather than the " drang nach osten " -lrb- drive to the east -rrb- a popular slogan of the former east german communist government , poles jokingly refer to it as the " drang nach westen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szczecin : nice town , a little pricey though for restaurateur tomasz pawlik , the price he paid for a home in the small town of wetzenau on the german side of the polish border is well worth the 25-kilometer drive from his modern restaurant in the center of the city of 400,000 .
" everybody associates our move to germany with leaving poland for good , " said pawlik , who bought a house formerly built for a lutheran minister with his artist girlfriend .
" but in fact out village of wetzenau is more like a suburb of szczecin . " local officials welcoming polish business rather than complain about the buyers from the east , local town officials are embracing their business .
german officials from the town of pasewalk , just across the border from szczecin , are frequent visitors to the polish city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles worried enlargment would bring greedy speculators across their borders .
the opposite has happened .
" everybody can come , we have enough to offer , " said beno mahler , pasewalk 's mayor .
" it ’ s one possibility to get a better financial situation for the economy of the region .
it ’ s positive if there ’ s life ; if nobody lives there , it will die . "
of course , mahler adds : " we would be happy if the situation of losing inhabitants could be stopped . ’
realtors discover boom market real estate agents would prefer things stay just the way they are .
dozens of such agencies have been set up in szczecin in the past twelve months .
sitting in her new office in a szczecin suburb , real estate agent magdalena pyrz now has a list of seven hundred customers looking to buy or rent property on the german side .
" i know we ’ ve sold 9 houses , we ’ ve rented 14 flats in 5 months , four firms set up their businesses .
the interest of polish people is enormous .
their housing prices are excellent , " said pyrz .
" some of the houses needing to be renovated are sometimes three to four times cheaper than in poland around szczecin .
generally , there are not enough flats and houses for the 400,000 people living here . "
and what is it in particular the new polish residents like about their neighbors ?
pyrz says the like how clean it is , the way german people look after their houses , and the infrastructure is excellent .
" for all these reasons , polish people want to move to germany .

experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .
there is also considerable experience in the production of flu vaccines , particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in circulating virus due to mutation .
however , at least four months would be needed to produce a new vaccine , in significant quantities , that is capable of protecting against a new virus subtype . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu virus wings westwards as bird flu spreads across russia , authorities confirmed the outbreak is the same strain of the disease that caused human deaths in asia .

migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .
there is also considerable experience in the production of flu vaccines , particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in circulating virus due to mutation .
however , at least four months would be needed to produce a new vaccine , in significant quantities , that is capable of protecting against a new virus subtype . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu virus wings westwards as bird flu spreads across russia , authorities confirmed the outbreak is the same strain of the disease that caused human deaths in asia .

ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and bayern have offered a lucrative four-year extension but are growing impatient at the player 's reluctance to sign on the dotted line .

" bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .

ballack joined bayern from bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2002 and said at the time he was not ready for a move abroad , but at 28 this could be his last chance to ply his trade in another league .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .
billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .
the office will also serve as a platform for a national it security crisis center to be built up over the next few years .
the center would be responsible for coordinating measures against planned large-scale attacks on the nation 's it infrastructure . preventing terrorist attacks schily specifically pinpointed a need to increase efforts to ward off or deal with major attacks on the energy , transport and banking sectors .
" i 'm not saying that we have any specific indications right now that terrorist groupings are already planning such attacks in germany .
but if such attacks hit us unaware , they would no doubt cause major damage and would have repercussions beyond our national borders , " schily told reporters . the federal office 's director udo helmbrecht said that while terrorist attacks could not be entirely ruled out , most of his organization 's efforts at the moment were going into campaigns to raise public awareness to help users cope with the security pitfalls of modern computer systems .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .
billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .
the office will also serve as a platform for a national it security crisis center to be built up over the next few years .
the center would be responsible for coordinating measures against planned large-scale attacks on the nation 's it infrastructure . preventing terrorist attacks schily specifically pinpointed a need to increase efforts to ward off or deal with major attacks on the energy , transport and banking sectors .
" i 'm not saying that we have any specific indications right now that terrorist groupings are already planning such attacks in germany .
but if such attacks hit us unaware , they would no doubt cause major damage and would have repercussions beyond our national borders , " schily told reporters . the federal office 's director udo helmbrecht said that while terrorist attacks could not be entirely ruled out , most of his organization 's efforts at the moment were going into campaigns to raise public awareness to help users cope with the security pitfalls of modern computer systems . " our office is currently working out comprehensive guidelines for the safe use of wireless networking and voice-over-ip telephony as well as instructions on how to fight spam mails , " helmbrecht said .
the information will be accessible to all citizens and companies for free . hardy graupner -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teen admits to unleashing computer worm a german teenager confessed on the first day of his trial tuesday to creating the internet sasser worm that waylaid millions of computers around the globe last year , a court official said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the westward migration of bird flu bird flu reaches europe fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds germans move to prevent bird flu eu leaders to hold bird flu crisis talks germany -pipe- 20.08.2005 what is bird flu ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain of the bird flu virus under the microspcope primarily affecting birds , the avian influenza virus can infect humans who come into in close contact with infected animals .
experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .
there is also considerable experience in the production of flu vaccines , particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in circulating virus due to mutation .
however , at least four months would be needed to produce a new vaccine , in significant quantities , that is capable of protecting against a new virus subtype . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu virus wings westwards as bird flu spreads across russia , authorities confirmed the outbreak is the same strain of the disease that caused human deaths in asia .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

polish commuters welcome fears that rich germans would storm into poland following eu enlargement and buy up properties appear unfounded .
houses are being bought , but it 's the poles who are finding deals - in east germany . situated right on the german frontier , and poised to serve as a gateway to scandinavia , the port city of szczecin has played its cards right in the past fifteen years . the collapse of the old east germany has been a boon to local businessmen , who have made fortunes off of germans crossing the border in search of cheaper goods and services .
but when those businessmen started looking around for property to buy , they found themselves priced out of their own market .
their solution ?
cross the border into eastern germany . " before poland joined the eu , the nation ’ s biggest fear was the invasion of germans buying land they could purchase for half the price of land in their own country , " said iwona lejman , a polish journalist .
" however , in the szczecin area the trend is going totally in the opposite direction .
the german side is poor and depressed … -lrb- and -rrb- seeing an exodus of young people looking for jobs and a better life .
they leave behind their old and empty houses . " a german suburb for a polish city now those empty properties are getting snatched up by polish businessmen , a surprising twist in the developing saga of european enlargement .
rather than the " drang nach osten " -lrb- drive to the east -rrb- a popular slogan of the former east german communist government , poles jokingly refer to it as the " drang nach westen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szczecin : nice town , a little pricey though for restaurateur tomasz pawlik , the price he paid for a home in the small town of wetzenau on the german side of the polish border is well worth the 25-kilometer drive from his modern restaurant in the center of the city of 400,000 .
" everybody associates our move to germany with leaving poland for good , " said pawlik , who bought a house formerly built for a lutheran minister with his artist girlfriend .
" but in fact out village of wetzenau is more like a suburb of szczecin . " local officials welcoming polish business rather than complain about the buyers from the east , local town officials are embracing their business .
german officials from the town of pasewalk , just across the border from szczecin , are frequent visitors to the polish city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles worried enlargment would bring greedy speculators across their borders .
the opposite has happened .
" everybody can come , we have enough to offer , " said beno mahler , pasewalk 's mayor .
" it ’ s one possibility to get a better financial situation for the economy of the region .
it ’ s positive if there ’ s life ; if nobody lives there , it will die . "
of course , mahler adds : " we would be happy if the situation of losing inhabitants could be stopped . ’
realtors discover boom market real estate agents would prefer things stay just the way they are .
dozens of such agencies have been set up in szczecin in the past twelve months .
sitting in her new office in a szczecin suburb , real estate agent magdalena pyrz now has a list of seven hundred customers looking to buy or rent property on the german side .
" i know we ’ ve sold 9 houses , we ’ ve rented 14 flats in 5 months , four firms set up their businesses .
the interest of polish people is enormous .
their housing prices are excellent , " said pyrz .
" some of the houses needing to be renovated are sometimes three to four times cheaper than in poland around szczecin .
generally , there are not enough flats and houses for the 400,000 people living here . "
and what is it in particular the new polish residents like about their neighbors ?
pyrz says the like how clean it is , the way german people look after their houses , and the infrastructure is excellent .
" for all these reasons , polish people want to move to germany .

polish commuters welcome fears that rich germans would storm into poland following eu enlargement and buy up properties appear unfounded .
houses are being bought , but it 's the poles who are finding deals - in east germany . situated right on the german frontier , and poised to serve as a gateway to scandinavia , the port city of szczecin has played its cards right in the past fifteen years . the collapse of the old east germany has been a boon to local businessmen , who have made fortunes off of germans crossing the border in search of cheaper goods and services .
but when those businessmen started looking around for property to buy , they found themselves priced out of their own market .
their solution ?
cross the border into eastern germany . " before poland joined the eu , the nation ’ s biggest fear was the invasion of germans buying land they could purchase for half the price of land in their own country , " said iwona lejman , a polish journalist .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szczecin : nice town , a little pricey though for restaurateur tomasz pawlik , the price he paid for a home in the small town of wetzenau on the german side of the polish border is well worth the 25-kilometer drive from his modern restaurant in the center of the city of 400,000 .
" everybody associates our move to germany with leaving poland for good , " said pawlik , who bought a house formerly built for a lutheran minister with his artist girlfriend .
" but in fact out village of wetzenau is more like a suburb of szczecin . " local officials welcoming polish business rather than complain about the buyers from the east , local town officials are embracing their business .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .

surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2005 pope calls on muslims to fight terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we must eliminate intolerance and violence from our hearts " pope benedict xvi urged muslim leaders to join christians to help defeat the intolerance which he said was at the root of the terrorist violence seeking to poison ties between the two religions . at a gathering of germany 's muslim officials , the leader of the catholic church on saturday decried the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism and called out to muslims to join christians in trying to combat its spread . " i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .
if they do not , he warned , the world will be exposed to " the darkness of a new barbarism . " stressing inter-religious dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi visits the cologne synagogue the 78-year-old benedict , who met with jewish leaders in a cologne synagogue on friday and warned against the development of new forms of anti-semitism , has made inter-religious relations one of the goals of his papacy .
he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany , echoed the pope 's message of reconciliation in his speech : " the islamic world also needs to recognize its historic guilt and prepare for a new constructive beginning . " " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .

iran legend daei , the first man to score 100 goals at international level , was handpicked by west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer in 1998 , but moved on a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hashemian fared little better leaving the club this season after failing to make an impact following a two million euro move from vfl bochum last summer . " maybe the other iranian players did not have that little bit of luck at bayern , " said karimi .
" but i hope to have an impact here and prove that i am a good footballer . " lauded player snapped up by astute club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian player of the year karimi has won over 80 caps for iran and his tally of 32 goals has seen him labeled ' the asian maradona ' - in reference to argentina 's 1986 world cup hero diego . despite the hype bayern were the only major european club to come in for karimi snapping him up on a free transfer from al-ahli in dubai . a one-year renewable contract means karimi can not afford a settling in period but if the performance in leverkusen is anything to go by he is already feeling at home in munich . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de impressive iran 's bundesliga connection if its current impressive form continues , iran 's national soccer team should feature at the 2006 world cup in germany .

" after the 4-1 defeat against leverkusen last season i drafted in players who are strong at winning tackles , " confirmed magath .
" ali did that and his attacking approach pleases me too . " respected magazine kicker voted karimi in the team of the weekend and the midfielder could hardly contain his joy at scoring on his full bundesliga debut . karimi growing in confidence with bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i am getting stronger and my first bundesliga goal gives me a lot of confidence , " enthused karimi .

there is more to come . " with bayern leading 2-1 karimi showed good composure to volley home in the 35th minute after dutch international roy makaay had won the ball at the back post . karimi came off in the 58th minute for brazilian international ze roberto but a warm ovation from the traveling munich fans showed their appreciation for his contribution . previous bad experiences of iranians at munich bayern have had bad experiences with iranian internationals in the past with striking pair ali daei and vahid hashemian disappearing without a trace .

" maybe the other iranian players did not have that little bit of luck at bayern , " said karimi .
" but i hope to have an impact here and prove that i am a good footballer . " lauded player snapped up by astute club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian player of the year karimi has won over 80 caps for iran and his tally of 32 goals has seen him labeled ' the asian maradona ' - in reference to argentina 's 1986 world cup hero diego . despite the hype bayern were the only major european club to come in for karimi snapping him up on a free transfer from al-ahli in dubai . a one-year renewable contract means karimi can not afford a settling in period but if the performance in leverkusen is anything to go by he is already feeling at home in munich . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de impressive iran 's bundesliga connection if its current impressive form continues , iran 's national soccer team should feature at the 2006 world cup in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2005 pope mingles with german politicians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's here to preach not to politicize pope benedict xvi took time out of his world youth day schedule to hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger in the sept .
18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .
indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .
better to wait ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg habor german frustration with schröder 's government is largely based on its inability to bring down the country 's chronic unemployment . the economy , once again , stagnated in the second quarter .
however , according to the latest edition of the economist , germany might finally be on the verge of a substantial recovery .
were that true , schröder might have been in a much better position to win re-election in the fall of 2006 .
with that in mind , i 'd probably say calling the early election was n't such a great idea .
voters might have been more willing to accept schröder 's welfare cuts and labor market reforms . but hindsight , of course , is a luxury not afforded to politicians when they make tough choices .
in may , schröder clearly decided the only way to get a mandate for his agenda of unpopular economic reform was to go to voters .
victory at the polls would both silence his internal party critics and encourage the conservative opposition - which controls the upper house - to work with him and not against him .
and that 's why i still respect schröder 's bold springtime gamble , even if it ends up costing him his job . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de surprise good review for german economy one of the world 's most prominent business magazines has given the german economy the thumbs up .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .
indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .
better to wait ?

were that true , schröder might have been in a much better position to win re-election in the fall of 2006 .
with that in mind , i 'd probably say calling the early election was n't such a great idea .
voters might have been more willing to accept schröder 's welfare cuts and labor market reforms . but hindsight , of course , is a luxury not afforded to politicians when they make tough choices .
in may , schröder clearly decided the only way to get a mandate for his agenda of unpopular economic reform was to go to voters .
victory at the polls would both silence his internal party critics and encourage the conservative opposition - which controls the upper house - to work with him and not against him .

indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .

but industry analysts are scratching their heads over why the gaming industry in general in germany has n't taken off . organizers were thrilled at the numbers of visitors on the first day of the games convention - some 28,000 came to view the very latest in computer gaming technology , 75 percent more than did last year .
but those numbers do n't necessarily reflect a growth in the sector in germany . in fact , many of the visitors are less than pleased about the general state of gaming in germany , which lags far behind other big economies such as the united states and japan . " we have some way to catch up , to put it mildly , " josef rahmen , the fair 's director , said at news conference .
" it 's a very important industry , and we should n't leave it all to our american , japanese and english friends .

that is a 15 percent increase over the previous year , but still a drop in the bucket compared to the 21 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- spent worldwide on video game software and hardware every year . makes kids stupid ? germany 's reluctance to spend on video games could be partly due to widespread perceptions in the country among older people that playing video games makes young people stupid , according to gerhard florin , european manager of the world 's biggest games software company , electronic arts . " i 'm often asked when i 'm abroad , in connection with our industry : ' what is wrong with the germans ? " ' he said during the fair 's keynote speech . florin blamed the negative attitudes about video gaming on ignorance , saying germany was in need of a public education campaign .
otherwise , he said , the country could find itself in a cultural backwater . " germany is really a special case due to our history .
our government is always making excuses for what happened 60 years ago , " said manfred gerdes , managing director of sony germany , referring to the country 's nazi past .
" people hate violent games . "

" german mothers are the gatekeepers , and they have a very low tolerance for violent video games , " said the head spokesperson for electronic arts , the world 's biggest video games maker . pushing for more acceptance in fact , fair organizers have enlisted two organizations , a federal gaming association and children 's charity of germany , to help campaign for more video game acceptance .
the fair has a family-themed section where parents can look at the latest in education-oriented gaming software . psychologist bernd friedrich , who played a colorful african animals game at the fair , defended video games , saying he used computer games to teach students with learning difficulties in two children 's homes where he works . he added that games gave children an opportunity to question things and learn in an interactive way . bildunterschrift : dirk hoeschen , a spokesman for children 's charity , said there was a lack of computer awareness among german schoolchildren that was to blame for the games industry 's weakness .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .
billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .
the office will also serve as a platform for a national it security crisis center to be built up over the next few years .
the center would be responsible for coordinating measures against planned large-scale attacks on the nation 's it infrastructure . preventing terrorist attacks schily specifically pinpointed a need to increase efforts to ward off or deal with major attacks on the energy , transport and banking sectors .

polish commuters welcome fears that rich germans would storm into poland following eu enlargement and buy up properties appear unfounded .
houses are being bought , but it 's the poles who are finding deals - in east germany . situated right on the german frontier , and poised to serve as a gateway to scandinavia , the port city of szczecin has played its cards right in the past fifteen years . the collapse of the old east germany has been a boon to local businessmen , who have made fortunes off of germans crossing the border in search of cheaper goods and services .
but when those businessmen started looking around for property to buy , they found themselves priced out of their own market .
their solution ?
cross the border into eastern germany . " before poland joined the eu , the nation ’ s biggest fear was the invasion of germans buying land they could purchase for half the price of land in their own country , " said iwona lejman , a polish journalist .
" however , in the szczecin area the trend is going totally in the opposite direction .
the german side is poor and depressed … -lrb- and -rrb- seeing an exodus of young people looking for jobs and a better life .
they leave behind their old and empty houses . " a german suburb for a polish city now those empty properties are getting snatched up by polish businessmen , a surprising twist in the developing saga of european enlargement .
rather than the " drang nach osten " -lrb- drive to the east -rrb- a popular slogan of the former east german communist government , poles jokingly refer to it as the " drang nach westen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szczecin : nice town , a little pricey though for restaurateur tomasz pawlik , the price he paid for a home in the small town of wetzenau on the german side of the polish border is well worth the 25-kilometer drive from his modern restaurant in the center of the city of 400,000 .
" everybody associates our move to germany with leaving poland for good , " said pawlik , who bought a house formerly built for a lutheran minister with his artist girlfriend .
" but in fact out village of wetzenau is more like a suburb of szczecin . " local officials welcoming polish business rather than complain about the buyers from the east , local town officials are embracing their business .
german officials from the town of pasewalk , just across the border from szczecin , are frequent visitors to the polish city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles worried enlargment would bring greedy speculators across their borders .
the opposite has happened .
" everybody can come , we have enough to offer , " said beno mahler , pasewalk 's mayor .
" it ’ s one possibility to get a better financial situation for the economy of the region .
it ’ s positive if there ’ s life ; if nobody lives there , it will die . "
of course , mahler adds : " we would be happy if the situation of losing inhabitants could be stopped . ’
realtors discover boom market real estate agents would prefer things stay just the way they are .
dozens of such agencies have been set up in szczecin in the past twelve months .
sitting in her new office in a szczecin suburb , real estate agent magdalena pyrz now has a list of seven hundred customers looking to buy or rent property on the german side .
" i know we ’ ve sold 9 houses , we ’ ve rented 14 flats in 5 months , four firms set up their businesses .
the interest of polish people is enormous .
their housing prices are excellent , " said pyrz .
" some of the houses needing to be renovated are sometimes three to four times cheaper than in poland around szczecin .
generally , there are not enough flats and houses for the 400,000 people living here . "
and what is it in particular the new polish residents like about their neighbors ?
pyrz says the like how clean it is , the way german people look after their houses , and the infrastructure is excellent .
" for all these reasons , polish people want to move to germany .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .
indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .
better to wait ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg habor german frustration with schröder 's government is largely based on its inability to bring down the country 's chronic unemployment . the economy , once again , stagnated in the second quarter .
however , according to the latest edition of the economist , germany might finally be on the verge of a substantial recovery .
were that true , schröder might have been in a much better position to win re-election in the fall of 2006 .
with that in mind , i 'd probably say calling the early election was n't such a great idea .
voters might have been more willing to accept schröder 's welfare cuts and labor market reforms . but hindsight , of course , is a luxury not afforded to politicians when they make tough choices .
in may , schröder clearly decided the only way to get a mandate for his agenda of unpopular economic reform was to go to voters .
victory at the polls would both silence his internal party critics and encourage the conservative opposition - which controls the upper house - to work with him and not against him .
and that 's why i still respect schröder 's bold springtime gamble , even if it ends up costing him his job . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de surprise good review for german economy one of the world 's most prominent business magazines has given the german economy the thumbs up .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .
indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .

the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .

indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .

but industry analysts are scratching their heads over why the gaming industry in general in germany has n't taken off . organizers were thrilled at the numbers of visitors on the first day of the games convention - some 28,000 came to view the very latest in computer gaming technology , 75 percent more than did last year .
but those numbers do n't necessarily reflect a growth in the sector in germany . in fact , many of the visitors are less than pleased about the general state of gaming in germany , which lags far behind other big economies such as the united states and japan . " we have some way to catch up , to put it mildly , " josef rahmen , the fair 's director , said at news conference .

" ' he said during the fair 's keynote speech . florin blamed the negative attitudes about video gaming on ignorance , saying germany was in need of a public education campaign .
otherwise , he said , the country could find itself in a cultural backwater . " germany is really a special case due to our history .

the fair has a family-themed section where parents can look at the latest in education-oriented gaming software . psychologist bernd friedrich , who played a colorful african animals game at the fair , defended video games , saying he used computer games to teach students with learning difficulties in two children 's homes where he works . he added that games gave children an opportunity to question things and learn in an interactive way . bildunterschrift : dirk hoeschen , a spokesman for children 's charity , said there was a lack of computer awareness among german schoolchildren that was to blame for the games industry 's weakness .

but industry analysts are scratching their heads over why the gaming industry in general in germany has n't taken off . organizers were thrilled at the numbers of visitors on the first day of the games convention - some 28,000 came to view the very latest in computer gaming technology , 75 percent more than did last year .
but those numbers do n't necessarily reflect a growth in the sector in germany . in fact , many of the visitors are less than pleased about the general state of gaming in germany , which lags far behind other big economies such as the united states and japan . " we have some way to catch up , to put it mildly , " josef rahmen , the fair 's director , said at news conference .
" it 's a very important industry , and we should n't leave it all to our american , japanese and english friends . " bildunterschrift : a human lara croft double from " tomb raider " poses at the trade fair only around one in 10 households in germany , europe 's biggest but slowest-growing economy , has a video game console as opposed to about one in three in the united states , the world 's largest video game market . it is a big business in germany , where , according to fair organizers , people spent 466 million euros -lrb- $ 567 million -rrb- on video games in 2004 .
that is a 15 percent increase over the previous year , but still a drop in the bucket compared to the 21 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- spent worldwide on video game software and hardware every year . makes kids stupid ? germany 's reluctance to spend on video games could be partly due to widespread perceptions in the country among older people that playing video games makes young people stupid , according to gerhard florin , european manager of the world 's biggest games software company , electronic arts . " i 'm often asked when i 'm abroad , in connection with our industry : ' what is wrong with the germans ? " ' he said during the fair 's keynote speech . florin blamed the negative attitudes about video gaming on ignorance , saying germany was in need of a public education campaign .
otherwise , he said , the country could find itself in a cultural backwater . " germany is really a special case due to our history .
our government is always making excuses for what happened 60 years ago , " said manfred gerdes , managing director of sony germany , referring to the country 's nazi past .
" people hate violent games . "
bildunterschrift : fair visitors playing " resident evil " in leipzig teenagers and young adults are the key target audience for video-game markers , but industry experts say parents often wo n't allow money to be spent on the games and consoles , including sony 's playstation 2 , microsoft 's xbox , or nintendo 's gamecube .
" german mothers are the gatekeepers , and they have a very low tolerance for violent video games , " said the head spokesperson for electronic arts , the world 's biggest video games maker . pushing for more acceptance in fact , fair organizers have enlisted two organizations , a federal gaming association and children 's charity of germany , to help campaign for more video game acceptance .
the fair has a family-themed section where parents can look at the latest in education-oriented gaming software . psychologist bernd friedrich , who played a colorful african animals game at the fair , defended video games , saying he used computer games to teach students with learning difficulties in two children 's homes where he works . he added that games gave children an opportunity to question things and learn in an interactive way . bildunterschrift : dirk hoeschen , a spokesman for children 's charity , said there was a lack of computer awareness among german schoolchildren that was to blame for the games industry 's weakness . " it 's impossible to understand why computers are n't used in kindergartens , " he told ap , adding that german school 's placed too high a regard for the book over other media . gerhard florin from electronic arts advocated a mixed approach .
" it 's not bad to read books but it 's just as good to play games . " he and other organizers say they do n't only want german kids to play more games and the market to open up ; they also hope the german economy will benefit from gaming .
right now , there are no major games software or hardware companies in germany . " it 's amazing how far behind we are as developers for this market , " malte behrmann , manager at g.a.m.e. , an association of german game developers , told ap . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video game fair spotlights european market the third computer games convention came to an end in leipzig on sunday with positive feedback for the future of the event itself but less than good news for the german gaming industry .

experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .
there is also considerable experience in the production of flu vaccines , particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in circulating virus due to mutation .
however , at least four months would be needed to produce a new vaccine , in significant quantities , that is capable of protecting against a new virus subtype . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu virus wings westwards as bird flu spreads across russia , authorities confirmed the outbreak is the same strain of the disease that caused human deaths in asia .

polish commuters welcome fears that rich germans would storm into poland following eu enlargement and buy up properties appear unfounded .
houses are being bought , but it 's the poles who are finding deals - in east germany . situated right on the german frontier , and poised to serve as a gateway to scandinavia , the port city of szczecin has played its cards right in the past fifteen years . the collapse of the old east germany has been a boon to local businessmen , who have made fortunes off of germans crossing the border in search of cheaper goods and services .
but when those businessmen started looking around for property to buy , they found themselves priced out of their own market .
their solution ?
cross the border into eastern germany . " before poland joined the eu , the nation ’ s biggest fear was the invasion of germans buying land they could purchase for half the price of land in their own country , " said iwona lejman , a polish journalist .
" however , in the szczecin area the trend is going totally in the opposite direction .
the german side is poor and depressed … -lrb- and -rrb- seeing an exodus of young people looking for jobs and a better life .
they leave behind their old and empty houses . " a german suburb for a polish city now those empty properties are getting snatched up by polish businessmen , a surprising twist in the developing saga of european enlargement .
rather than the " drang nach osten " -lrb- drive to the east -rrb- a popular slogan of the former east german communist government , poles jokingly refer to it as the " drang nach westen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : szczecin : nice town , a little pricey though for restaurateur tomasz pawlik , the price he paid for a home in the small town of wetzenau on the german side of the polish border is well worth the 25-kilometer drive from his modern restaurant in the center of the city of 400,000 .
" everybody associates our move to germany with leaving poland for good , " said pawlik , who bought a house formerly built for a lutheran minister with his artist girlfriend .
" but in fact out village of wetzenau is more like a suburb of szczecin . " local officials welcoming polish business rather than complain about the buyers from the east , local town officials are embracing their business .
german officials from the town of pasewalk , just across the border from szczecin , are frequent visitors to the polish city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles worried enlargment would bring greedy speculators across their borders .
the opposite has happened .
" everybody can come , we have enough to offer , " said beno mahler , pasewalk 's mayor .
" it ’ s one possibility to get a better financial situation for the economy of the region .
it ’ s positive if there ’ s life ; if nobody lives there , it will die . "
of course , mahler adds : " we would be happy if the situation of losing inhabitants could be stopped . ’
realtors discover boom market real estate agents would prefer things stay just the way they are .
dozens of such agencies have been set up in szczecin in the past twelve months .
sitting in her new office in a szczecin suburb , real estate agent magdalena pyrz now has a list of seven hundred customers looking to buy or rent property on the german side .
" i know we ’ ve sold 9 houses , we ’ ve rented 14 flats in 5 months , four firms set up their businesses .
the interest of polish people is enormous .
their housing prices are excellent , " said pyrz .
" some of the houses needing to be renovated are sometimes three to four times cheaper than in poland around szczecin .
generally , there are not enough flats and houses for the 400,000 people living here . "
and what is it in particular the new polish residents like about their neighbors ?
pyrz says the like how clean it is , the way german people look after their houses , and the infrastructure is excellent .
" for all these reasons , polish people want to move to germany .

instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .

"
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .
billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .
the office will also serve as a platform for a national it security crisis center to be built up over the next few years .
the center would be responsible for coordinating measures against planned large-scale attacks on the nation 's it infrastructure . preventing terrorist attacks schily specifically pinpointed a need to increase efforts to ward off or deal with major attacks on the energy , transport and banking sectors .
" i 'm not saying that we have any specific indications right now that terrorist groupings are already planning such attacks in germany .
but if such attacks hit us unaware , they would no doubt cause major damage and would have repercussions beyond our national borders , " schily told reporters . the federal office 's director udo helmbrecht said that while terrorist attacks could not be entirely ruled out , most of his organization 's efforts at the moment were going into campaigns to raise public awareness to help users cope with the security pitfalls of modern computer systems . " our office is currently working out comprehensive guidelines for the safe use of wireless networking and voice-over-ip telephony as well as instructions on how to fight spam mails , " helmbrecht said .

dortmund have the highest average attendance in europe , several thousand better than spanish titans real madrid and barcelona , and other host cities for the 2006 world cup are not far behind . bayern munich 's 340 million euro -lrb- $ 413m -rrb- allianz arena enjoyed a capacity 66,000 capacity crowd for the club 's opening 3-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach a fortnight ago . prices make german games attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admittedly the excitement of experiencing the atmosphere at the new arena is a major attraction , but maybe there is another reason why german stadiums are full - affordability .
in germany it seems younger people and the working classes can afford to watch their local club and ensure the stadiums are full . it 's a direct comparison to the english premier league where the most expensive season ticket for newly promoted sunderland will cost ₤ 445 -lrb- 657 euros -rrb- and the cheapest ₤ 110 -lrb- 162 euros -rrb- .
at schalke 04 , one of the top clubs in germany , offering their best season tickets at 192 euros . arsenal , a club of a similar standing in england , has the most expensive season tickets in europe at ₤ 885 -lrb- 1307 euros -rrb- , just over 1000 euros more than the most expensive german tickets , those at bayern munich . with tickets more affordable throughout germany , the hosts have a sense that the momentum can continue with crowds flocking to stadiums as the excitement heightens , culminating in huge numbers of expectant fans once the main event opens . atmosphere building as world cup approaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the atmosphere at the world cup stadiums , and indeed germany as a whole , is something special , " explained germany coach jürgen klinsmann .
" you can sense that there is big tournament just around the corner . " if the atmosphere in the bundesliga is mirrored in the 2006 world cup , running from june 9 to july 9 , players and fans can look forward to a football fest . but it is worth remembering that world cup tickets will be far from cheap and black market prices already range from 35 euros to 600 euros on auction site ebay . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bring on the world cup , germany says the confederations cup ended with a bang on wednesday with a masterclass display by brazil .
from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- the sound of soccer being blind or partially-sighted is no longer a barrier to enjoying the visual spectacle of soccer .

experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .
there is also considerable experience in the production of flu vaccines , particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in circulating virus due to mutation .

experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .
there is also considerable experience in the production of flu vaccines , particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in circulating virus due to mutation .

the miss-matched tie on friday evening offered few surprises with the bundesliga outfit putting four past the youth team without reply . vahid hashemian , the iranian international signed by hanover from bayern munich , opened the scoring in the sixth minute .
hanover finished the game at a stroll after cologne 's tobias nickenig was sent off midway through the first half and completed the rout with goals from thomas brdaric , chavdar yankov and jiri stajner . the other top league side in action on friday was recently promoted eintracht frankfurt who won in less comfortable circumstances against rot-weiss oberhausen , holding on to a 2-1 victory for their first win of the season . new signings benjamin huggel and ioannis amanatidis put frankfurt 2-0 up before dalibor gataric 's reply 13 minutes from time set up a nervous finale . cottbus keeper the saviour and hero the pick of the other six matches was the cliff-hanger between second division energie cottbus and amateurs rot-weiss essen which finished in favor of the professionals from the east after a dramatic penalty shoot-out which cottbus won 5-4 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian faruk hujdurovic , left , brazilian vragel da silva , center , and bosnian keeper tomislav piplica , right , of cottbus .
the hero of the night was energie 's bosnian goalkeeper tomislav piplica -lrb- photo , right -rrb- who saved from lennart lynge larsen at 4-4 in the shootout before scoring the winner himself . high-flying hamburg sv will be well aware of the significance of their cup tie against stuttgarter kickers , one of 13 games being played on saturday .
it is one year since they were dumped out of the competition last season by corrupt referee robert hoyzer . memory of fixed match wo n't hamper hamburg hamburg lost 4-2 away to sc paderborn , after conceding two penalties and having belgian striker emile mpenza sent off in a match that was fixed by hoyzer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even though a european place is at stake for hamburg when they defend a 1-0 lead at valencia in the intertoto cup on tuesday , the memory of that fateful game last year will not stop coach thomas doll putting out a strong side . “ we ’ ll be going in at full strength , ” doll said .
“ i was an amateur coach myself for a while and this sort of match provides these clubs with their match of the season . ”
hamburg will see the draw for the first round as an extremely good omen .

the miss-matched tie on friday evening offered few surprises with the bundesliga outfit putting four past the youth team without reply . vahid hashemian , the iranian international signed by hanover from bayern munich , opened the scoring in the sixth minute .
hanover finished the game at a stroll after cologne 's tobias nickenig was sent off midway through the first half and completed the rout with goals from thomas brdaric , chavdar yankov and jiri stajner . the other top league side in action on friday was recently promoted eintracht frankfurt who won in less comfortable circumstances against rot-weiss oberhausen , holding on to a 2-1 victory for their first win of the season . new signings benjamin huggel and ioannis amanatidis put frankfurt 2-0 up before dalibor gataric 's reply 13 minutes from time set up a nervous finale . cottbus keeper the saviour and hero the pick of the other six matches was the cliff-hanger between second division energie cottbus and amateurs rot-weiss essen which finished in favor of the professionals from the east after a dramatic penalty shoot-out which cottbus won 5-4 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian faruk hujdurovic , left , brazilian vragel da silva , center , and bosnian keeper tomislav piplica , right , of cottbus .
the hero of the night was energie 's bosnian goalkeeper tomislav piplica -lrb- photo , right -rrb- who saved from lennart lynge larsen at 4-4 in the shootout before scoring the winner himself . high-flying hamburg sv will be well aware of the significance of their cup tie against stuttgarter kickers , one of 13 games being played on saturday .
it is one year since they were dumped out of the competition last season by corrupt referee robert hoyzer . memory of fixed match wo n't hamper hamburg hamburg lost 4-2 away to sc paderborn , after conceding two penalties and having belgian striker emile mpenza sent off in a match that was fixed by hoyzer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even though a european place is at stake for hamburg when they defend a 1-0 lead at valencia in the intertoto cup on tuesday , the memory of that fateful game last year will not stop coach thomas doll putting out a strong side . “ we ’ ll be going in at full strength , ” doll said .
“ i was an amateur coach myself for a while and this sort of match provides these clubs with their match of the season . ”
hamburg will see the draw for the first round as an extremely good omen .
hamburg beat stuttgarter kickers 3-1 in the final of the cup in 1987 .
hamburg 's opponents in the now notorious match , paderborn , are also back in action on saturday against vfl wolfsburg and will be eager to prove they can provide another upset , this time without any external assistance .
paderborn enter the game against the wolves on the back of a 5-0 league win in the second division and confidence is high .

but industry analysts are scratching their heads over why the gaming industry in general in germany has n't taken off . organizers were thrilled at the numbers of visitors on the first day of the games convention - some 28,000 came to view the very latest in computer gaming technology , 75 percent more than did last year .
but those numbers do n't necessarily reflect a growth in the sector in germany . in fact , many of the visitors are less than pleased about the general state of gaming in germany , which lags far behind other big economies such as the united states and japan . " we have some way to catch up , to put it mildly , " josef rahmen , the fair 's director , said at news conference .
" it 's a very important industry , and we should n't leave it all to our american , japanese and english friends . " bildunterschrift : a human lara croft double from " tomb raider " poses at the trade fair only around one in 10 households in germany , europe 's biggest but slowest-growing economy , has a video game console as opposed to about one in three in the united states , the world 's largest video game market . it is a big business in germany , where , according to fair organizers , people spent 466 million euros -lrb- $ 567 million -rrb- on video games in 2004 .
that is a 15 percent increase over the previous year , but still a drop in the bucket compared to the 21 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- spent worldwide on video game software and hardware every year . makes kids stupid ? germany 's reluctance to spend on video games could be partly due to widespread perceptions in the country among older people that playing video games makes young people stupid , according to gerhard florin , european manager of the world 's biggest games software company , electronic arts . " i 'm often asked when i 'm abroad , in connection with our industry : ' what is wrong with the germans ? " ' he said during the fair 's keynote speech . florin blamed the negative attitudes about video gaming on ignorance , saying germany was in need of a public education campaign .
otherwise , he said , the country could find itself in a cultural backwater . " germany is really a special case due to our history .
our government is always making excuses for what happened 60 years ago , " said manfred gerdes , managing director of sony germany , referring to the country 's nazi past .
" people hate violent games . "
bildunterschrift : fair visitors playing " resident evil " in leipzig teenagers and young adults are the key target audience for video-game markers , but industry experts say parents often wo n't allow money to be spent on the games and consoles , including sony 's playstation 2 , microsoft 's xbox , or nintendo 's gamecube .
" german mothers are the gatekeepers , and they have a very low tolerance for violent video games , " said the head spokesperson for electronic arts , the world 's biggest video games maker . pushing for more acceptance in fact , fair organizers have enlisted two organizations , a federal gaming association and children 's charity of germany , to help campaign for more video game acceptance .
the fair has a family-themed section where parents can look at the latest in education-oriented gaming software . psychologist bernd friedrich , who played a colorful african animals game at the fair , defended video games , saying he used computer games to teach students with learning difficulties in two children 's homes where he works . he added that games gave children an opportunity to question things and learn in an interactive way . bildunterschrift : dirk hoeschen , a spokesman for children 's charity , said there was a lack of computer awareness among german schoolchildren that was to blame for the games industry 's weakness .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .
indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .
better to wait ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg habor german frustration with schröder 's government is largely based on its inability to bring down the country 's chronic unemployment . the economy , once again , stagnated in the second quarter .
however , according to the latest edition of the economist , germany might finally be on the verge of a substantial recovery .
were that true , schröder might have been in a much better position to win re-election in the fall of 2006 .
with that in mind , i 'd probably say calling the early election was n't such a great idea .
voters might have been more willing to accept schröder 's welfare cuts and labor market reforms . but hindsight , of course , is a luxury not afforded to politicians when they make tough choices .
in may , schröder clearly decided the only way to get a mandate for his agenda of unpopular economic reform was to go to voters .
victory at the polls would both silence his internal party critics and encourage the conservative opposition - which controls the upper house - to work with him and not against him .
and that 's why i still respect schröder 's bold springtime gamble , even if it ends up costing him his job . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de surprise good review for german economy one of the world 's most prominent business magazines has given the german economy the thumbs up .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .
if they do not , he warned , the world will be exposed to " the darkness of a new barbarism . " stressing inter-religious dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi visits the cologne synagogue the 78-year-old benedict , who met with jewish leaders in a cologne synagogue on friday and warned against the development of new forms of anti-semitism , has made inter-religious relations one of the goals of his papacy .
he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany , echoed the pope 's message of reconciliation in his speech : " the islamic world also needs to recognize its historic guilt and prepare for a new constructive beginning . " " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .
teaching is the vehicle through which ideas and convictions are transmitted .
words are highly influential in the education of the mind .
you therefore have a great responsibility for the formation of the younger generation , " he said . early in the day , the pope was reported to have told german politicians he was in favor of introducing islamic instruction into the german school curriculum as an equal to the currently catholic and protestant religion courses provided .
when the classes are offered in german in the schools , the instruction is conducted by state-trained teachers with material authorized by state educational authorities . at the moment only three federal states offer islam as an official school religion course , leaving the majority of the country 's 3.2 million muslims to turn to private -lrb- non-state supervised -rrb- koran schools for religious education .
several german bishops have called for placing islam on an equal footing with christianity in schools as a means to help integrate muslim children and control fundamentalist teaching . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope mingles with german politicians pope benedict xvi took time out of his world youth day schedule to hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger in the sept .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .

he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace .

" " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .
teaching is the vehicle through which ideas and convictions are transmitted .
words are highly influential in the education of the mind .
you therefore have a great responsibility for the formation of the younger generation , " he said . early in the day , the pope was reported to have told german politicians he was in favor of introducing islamic instruction into the german school curriculum as an equal to the currently catholic and protestant religion courses provided .
when the classes are offered in german in the schools , the instruction is conducted by state-trained teachers with material authorized by state educational authorities . at the moment only three federal states offer islam as an official school religion course , leaving the majority of the country 's 3.2 million muslims to turn to private -lrb- non-state supervised -rrb- koran schools for religious education .

experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .
there is also considerable experience in the production of flu vaccines , particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in circulating virus due to mutation .
however , at least four months would be needed to produce a new vaccine , in significant quantities , that is capable of protecting against a new virus subtype . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu virus wings westwards as bird flu spreads across russia , authorities confirmed the outbreak is the same strain of the disease that caused human deaths in asia .

experts fear that the virus could mix with the human flu virus to produce a new deadly strain . avian influenza -lrb- " bird flu " -rrb- is an infectious disease caused by particular strains of the influenza virus .
experts believe that all birds are susceptible to infection , though some species are more resistant than others .
symptoms can be mild to very serious , even leading to death .
fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds .
so far , all outbreaks of the highly pathogenic form have been caused by influenza subtypes h5 and h7 .
migratory waterfowl – most notably wild ducks – are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses , and these birds are also the most resistant to infection .
domestic poultry , including chickens and turkeys , are particularly susceptible .
danger for humans bird flu viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and - in some instances - pigs .
the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in hong kong in 1997 , when the h5n1 strain caused severe illness in 18 people , six of whom died .
all those affected had close contact with infected poultry .
more than 60 people have died of bird flu since 2003 , all in asia .
the h5n1 strain is particularly dangerous because it mutates very rapidly and can mix with genes from other viruses thus allowing it to spread to other species .
in addition it is highly pathogenic and can cause severe disease outbreaks .
with the infection spreading in birds there 's an increased risk for direct infection of humans , too .
and if more people become infected , it also becomes more likely that humans , if infected with human and bird flu strains at the same time , could serve as the " mixing vessel " for the emergence of a novel strain that could easily be transmitted from person to person .
such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic .
symptoms in humans the symptoms appearing a few days after infection are those of a severe flu - a fever , sore throat and cough .
in many cases the victims also suffer from diarrhea and stomach pains .
about every second person who contracted the disease also died .
antiviral drugs , some of which can be used for both treatment and prevention , are effective against the virus , but they can be expensive and supplies are limited .
there is also considerable experience in the production of flu vaccines , particularly as vaccine composition changes each year to match changes in circulating virus due to mutation .
however , at least four months would be needed to produce a new vaccine , in significant quantities , that is capable of protecting against a new virus subtype . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu virus wings westwards as bird flu spreads across russia , authorities confirmed the outbreak is the same strain of the disease that caused human deaths in asia .

but industry analysts are scratching their heads over why the gaming industry in general in germany has n't taken off . organizers were thrilled at the numbers of visitors on the first day of the games convention - some 28,000 came to view the very latest in computer gaming technology , 75 percent more than did last year .
but those numbers do n't necessarily reflect a growth in the sector in germany . in fact , many of the visitors are less than pleased about the general state of gaming in germany , which lags far behind other big economies such as the united states and japan . " we have some way to catch up , to put it mildly , " josef rahmen , the fair 's director , said at news conference .

" i 'm often asked when i 'm abroad , in connection with our industry : ' what is wrong with the germans ? " ' he said during the fair 's keynote speech . florin blamed the negative attitudes about video gaming on ignorance , saying germany was in need of a public education campaign .
otherwise , he said , the country could find itself in a cultural backwater . " germany is really a special case due to our history .
our government is always making excuses for what happened 60 years ago , " said manfred gerdes , managing director of sony germany , referring to the country 's nazi past .

" german mothers are the gatekeepers , and they have a very low tolerance for violent video games , " said the head spokesperson for electronic arts , the world 's biggest video games maker . pushing for more acceptance in fact , fair organizers have enlisted two organizations , a federal gaming association and children 's charity of germany , to help campaign for more video game acceptance .
the fair has a family-themed section where parents can look at the latest in education-oriented gaming software . psychologist bernd friedrich , who played a colorful african animals game at the fair , defended video games , saying he used computer games to teach students with learning difficulties in two children 's homes where he works . he added that games gave children an opportunity to question things and learn in an interactive way . bildunterschrift : dirk hoeschen , a spokesman for children 's charity , said there was a lack of computer awareness among german schoolchildren that was to blame for the games industry 's weakness .

but industry analysts are scratching their heads over why the gaming industry in general in germany has n't taken off . organizers were thrilled at the numbers of visitors on the first day of the games convention - some 28,000 came to view the very latest in computer gaming technology , 75 percent more than did last year .
but those numbers do n't necessarily reflect a growth in the sector in germany . in fact , many of the visitors are less than pleased about the general state of gaming in germany , which lags far behind other big economies such as the united states and japan . " we have some way to catch up , to put it mildly , " josef rahmen , the fair 's director , said at news conference .

maybe his decision to have an early election was n't such a great idea , says dw-world 's marc young . if you 're looking for an early political obituary to go with germany 's early election , you 're in the wrong place .
although things look grim for him at the moment , i wo n't be tolling the bells for gerhard schröder just yet .
he 's pulled off seemingly impossible comebacks before and he might do so again . that said , it 's hard these days not to get a feeling of inevitability about the impending end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
flip open a paper or turn on the television in germany and you 're bombarded with retrospectives over the legacy of his so-called " red-green " coalition government .
and schröder 's relaxed presence on the campaign trail is often chalked up to his actually being relieved about soon being relieved of his responsibilities in berlin .
perhaps .
indeed , it does not look good for gerd : while his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are stuck at 30 percent in opinion polls , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have stabilized over 40 percent and the new socialist outfit , the left party , continues to pull in nearly 10 percent nationally .
surprising his opponents i imagine this is n't how the chancellor expected the campaign to play out after he decided in may to bring forward the next general election by a year .
september probably seemed far away back then .
by springing the snap poll after the state election debacle in spd-stronghold north rhine-westphalia , schröder had masterly wrong-footed his opponents both inside and outside his own party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , and bavarian premier chef edmund stoiber .
the conservative opposition was able to throw together a response , but the rough edges have shown .
not only has cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel seemed unsteady on the campaign trail , several of her colleagues have been extremely adept at insulting eastern german voters .
still , much to the chagrin of the spd , all the gaffes have n't particularly dented the conservatives ' standing in opinion polls .
and the surprising strength of the left party - formed from the successor to east germany 's communist party and disgruntled western social democrats - must be particularly gutting for schröder .
few - myself included - expected such a diverse grouping of old-school eastern socialists and cranky western trade unionists to be able to kit together a pan-german leftist party with such speed .
whether its two leading protagonists , gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine , can hold the left party together after the election - which i doubt - is irrelevant for schröder .
the damage will be done as they siphon off just enough support to stymie the spd 's chances of remaining the largest party in parliament .
better to wait ?

were that true , schröder might have been in a much better position to win re-election in the fall of 2006 .
with that in mind , i 'd probably say calling the early election was n't such a great idea .

" the sport of soccer fascinates people and the members of our community , " said pastor hans-joachim fischer in an interview with reuters .
" i know at least three priests who have season tickets for eintracht frankfurt .
we want to do more than set up a few television screens in our centers . " world cup services planned and prayers offered offering quiet places of reflection and spiritual guidance will only be part of the plan , according to ekd officials .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

the miss-matched tie on friday evening offered few surprises with the bundesliga outfit putting four past the youth team without reply . vahid hashemian , the iranian international signed by hanover from bayern munich , opened the scoring in the sixth minute .
hanover finished the game at a stroll after cologne 's tobias nickenig was sent off midway through the first half and completed the rout with goals from thomas brdaric , chavdar yankov and jiri stajner . the other top league side in action on friday was recently promoted eintracht frankfurt who won in less comfortable circumstances against rot-weiss oberhausen , holding on to a 2-1 victory for their first win of the season . new signings benjamin huggel and ioannis amanatidis put frankfurt 2-0 up before dalibor gataric 's reply 13 minutes from time set up a nervous finale . cottbus keeper the saviour and hero the pick of the other six matches was the cliff-hanger between second division energie cottbus and amateurs rot-weiss essen which finished in favor of the professionals from the east after a dramatic penalty shoot-out which cottbus won 5-4 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian faruk hujdurovic , left , brazilian vragel da silva , center , and bosnian keeper tomislav piplica , right , of cottbus .

it is one year since they were dumped out of the competition last season by corrupt referee robert hoyzer . memory of fixed match wo n't hamper hamburg hamburg lost 4-2 away to sc paderborn , after conceding two penalties and having belgian striker emile mpenza sent off in a match that was fixed by hoyzer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but even though a european place is at stake for hamburg when they defend a 1-0 lead at valencia in the intertoto cup on tuesday , the memory of that fateful game last year will not stop coach thomas doll putting out a strong side . “ we ’ ll be going in at full strength , ” doll said .
“ i was an amateur coach myself for a while and this sort of match provides these clubs with their match of the season . ”
hamburg will see the draw for the first round as an extremely good omen .
hamburg beat stuttgarter kickers 3-1 in the final of the cup in 1987 .
hamburg 's opponents in the now notorious match , paderborn , are also back in action on saturday against vfl wolfsburg and will be eager to prove they can provide another upset , this time without any external assistance .

lukas podolski and co. have won both their games in the league so far and are riding a tide of fanatical support and optimism which should see them negotiate the potentially tricky offenbach . the cup holders bayern munich begin their defense of the trophy against amateurs msv 1919 neuruppin in one of ten games being played on sunday .
munich , who beat schalke 04 in last season ’ s final to complete a league and cup double , have an easy start to their campaign and after hitting bayer leverkusen for five last weekend , neuruppin will be well advised to play ten defenders in front of their goalkeeper . borussia dortmund complete the first-round action at eintracht braunschweig on monday in a match that has embarrassing slip-up written all over it .

ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and bayern have offered a lucrative four-year extension but are growing impatient at the player 's reluctance to sign on the dotted line .
" we want an answer by the end of september or beginning of october , " general manager uli hoeness told the abendzeitung .
" our offer is on the table .
there is no need for more negotiations .
he has to just say ' yes ' or ' no ' . "
german international captain ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client .
" bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . "
ballack joined bayern from bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2002 and said at the time he was not ready for a move abroad , but at 28 this could be his last chance to ply his trade in another league .
if ballack does shun bayern 's contract offer the club are likely to immediately put the german player of the year up for sale rather than risk losing him for nothing at the end of the campaign . dw-world.de how soon before ballack moves abroad ?

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .
billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .
the office will also serve as a platform for a national it security crisis center to be built up over the next few years .
the center would be responsible for coordinating measures against planned large-scale attacks on the nation 's it infrastructure . preventing terrorist attacks schily specifically pinpointed a need to increase efforts to ward off or deal with major attacks on the energy , transport and banking sectors .
" i 'm not saying that we have any specific indications right now that terrorist groupings are already planning such attacks in germany .
but if such attacks hit us unaware , they would no doubt cause major damage and would have repercussions beyond our national borders , " schily told reporters . the federal office 's director udo helmbrecht said that while terrorist attacks could not be entirely ruled out , most of his organization 's efforts at the moment were going into campaigns to raise public awareness to help users cope with the security pitfalls of modern computer systems . " our office is currently working out comprehensive guidelines for the safe use of wireless networking and voice-over-ip telephony as well as instructions on how to fight spam mails , " helmbrecht said .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .
billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .
the office will also serve as a platform for a national it security crisis center to be built up over the next few years .
the center would be responsible for coordinating measures against planned large-scale attacks on the nation 's it infrastructure . preventing terrorist attacks schily specifically pinpointed a need to increase efforts to ward off or deal with major attacks on the energy , transport and banking sectors .
" i 'm not saying that we have any specific indications right now that terrorist groupings are already planning such attacks in germany .
but if such attacks hit us unaware , they would no doubt cause major damage and would have repercussions beyond our national borders , " schily told reporters . the federal office 's director udo helmbrecht said that while terrorist attacks could not be entirely ruled out , most of his organization 's efforts at the moment were going into campaigns to raise public awareness to help users cope with the security pitfalls of modern computer systems . " our office is currently working out comprehensive guidelines for the safe use of wireless networking and voice-over-ip telephony as well as instructions on how to fight spam mails , " helmbrecht said .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .
if they do not , he warned , the world will be exposed to " the darkness of a new barbarism . " stressing inter-religious dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi visits the cologne synagogue the 78-year-old benedict , who met with jewish leaders in a cologne synagogue on friday and warned against the development of new forms of anti-semitism , has made inter-religious relations one of the goals of his papacy .
he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany , echoed the pope 's message of reconciliation in his speech : " the islamic world also needs to recognize its historic guilt and prepare for a new constructive beginning . " " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .
teaching is the vehicle through which ideas and convictions are transmitted .
words are highly influential in the education of the mind .
you therefore have a great responsibility for the formation of the younger generation , " he said . early in the day , the pope was reported to have told german politicians he was in favor of introducing islamic instruction into the german school curriculum as an equal to the currently catholic and protestant religion courses provided .
when the classes are offered in german in the schools , the instruction is conducted by state-trained teachers with material authorized by state educational authorities . at the moment only three federal states offer islam as an official school religion course , leaving the majority of the country 's 3.2 million muslims to turn to private -lrb- non-state supervised -rrb- koran schools for religious education .
several german bishops have called for placing islam on an equal footing with christianity in schools as a means to help integrate muslim children and control fundamentalist teaching . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope mingles with german politicians pope benedict xvi took time out of his world youth day schedule to hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger in the sept .

in germany it seems younger people and the working classes can afford to watch their local club and ensure the stadiums are full . it 's a direct comparison to the english premier league where the most expensive season ticket for newly promoted sunderland will cost ₤ 445 -lrb- 657 euros -rrb- and the cheapest ₤ 110 -lrb- 162 euros -rrb- .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .

he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace .

" " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .

when the classes are offered in german in the schools , the instruction is conducted by state-trained teachers with material authorized by state educational authorities . at the moment only three federal states offer islam as an official school religion course , leaving the majority of the country 's 3.2 million muslims to turn to private -lrb- non-state supervised -rrb- koran schools for religious education .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy .

he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism .

a failure to invest in it security has cost the country billions of euros every year . it is rapidly becoming a regular feature in the nightly news : computer hackers shut down entire systems from some of the world 's biggest and most influential organizations .
the damage inflicted is immense in terms of lost work and profits .
at times , though , the destruction goes behind the mere economics and affects the nation 's very security . just a week ago a fast-moving global computer worm attacked computer networks relying on microsoft operating systems .
worst hit was the united states where offices on capitol hill as well as major media organizations were knocked out for hours .
the worm , which is believed to be a variant of the zotob virus , also made it to germany .
although its damage on this side of the atlantic was considerably less , it served as another reminder to it experts and political leaders how vulnerable the country 's computers are to attacks . within just the last year , computer experts have witnessed an incredibly high jump in the number of virus attacks in germany , many of which go unnoticed by the normal public .
the economic toll of these onslaughts , however , can not be underestimated , say industry security advisors .
billions of euros are lost every year due to a failure to ward off the attacks , many of which could be prevented . the country must do more to strengthen its line of it defense , the industry has said time and again .
now in response to the growing threat , interior minister otto schily has announced a national plan to raise the country 's risk awareness in the hopes that individuals and companies will take security more seriously . increasing awareness " despite the fact that more and more germans actively use technology such as personal computers , laptops or pdas and have become increasingly dependent on theses gadgets , only a small proportion care about security issues to the extent they should , " schily told the media in berlin last thursday . " it security more often than not only becomes a priority after some major damage has already occurred , " he added , saying the situation applied to both private users and companies . under schily 's plan , germany 's federal office for it security will receive more personnel and financial resources to improve its ability to detect security loopholes and suggest remedies .
the office will also serve as a platform for a national it security crisis center to be built up over the next few years .

ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and bayern have offered a lucrative four-year extension but are growing impatient at the player 's reluctance to sign on the dotted line .
" we want an answer by the end of september or beginning of october , " general manager uli hoeness told the abendzeitung .
" our offer is on the table .
there is no need for more negotiations .
he has to just say ' yes ' or ' no ' . "
german international captain ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client .
" bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . "
ballack joined bayern from bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2002 and said at the time he was not ready for a move abroad , but at 28 this could be his last chance to ply his trade in another league .

while most nations have an established number one custodian germany rotate kahn and arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann , with klinsmann believing it is good for competition ahead of the finals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.08.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc original einstein manuscript uncovered the original manuscript of a paper albert einstein published in 1925 has been found in the archives of leiden university 's lorentz institute for theoretical physics , a spokeswoman said saturday .
photographs of the 16-page document and a description of how a student at the dutch university stumbled upon it were posted on the institute 's web site .
leiden university spokeswoman hilje papma confirmed the historic finding .

" after the 4-1 defeat against leverkusen last season i drafted in players who are strong at winning tackles , " confirmed magath .
" ali did that and his attacking approach pleases me too . " respected magazine kicker voted karimi in the team of the weekend and the midfielder could hardly contain his joy at scoring on his full bundesliga debut . karimi growing in confidence with bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i am getting stronger and my first bundesliga goal gives me a lot of confidence , " enthused karimi .
" i hope the coach and fans are happy with me , although that was not me at 100 percent .
there is more to come . " with bayern leading 2-1 karimi showed good composure to volley home in the 35th minute after dutch international roy makaay had won the ball at the back post . karimi came off in the 58th minute for brazilian international ze roberto but a warm ovation from the traveling munich fans showed their appreciation for his contribution . previous bad experiences of iranians at munich bayern have had bad experiences with iranian internationals in the past with striking pair ali daei and vahid hashemian disappearing without a trace .
iran legend daei , the first man to score 100 goals at international level , was handpicked by west germany 's 1974 world cup winner franz beckenbauer in 1998 , but moved on a year later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hashemian fared little better leaving the club this season after failing to make an impact following a two million euro move from vfl bochum last summer . " maybe the other iranian players did not have that little bit of luck at bayern , " said karimi .

dortmund have the highest average attendance in europe , several thousand better than spanish titans real madrid and barcelona , and other host cities for the 2006 world cup are not far behind . bayern munich 's 340 million euro -lrb- $ 413m -rrb- allianz arena enjoyed a capacity 66,000 capacity crowd for the club 's opening 3-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach a fortnight ago . prices make german games attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admittedly the excitement of experiencing the atmosphere at the new arena is a major attraction , but maybe there is another reason why german stadiums are full - affordability .
in germany it seems younger people and the working classes can afford to watch their local club and ensure the stadiums are full . it 's a direct comparison to the english premier league where the most expensive season ticket for newly promoted sunderland will cost ₤ 445 -lrb- 657 euros -rrb- and the cheapest ₤ 110 -lrb- 162 euros -rrb- .
at schalke 04 , one of the top clubs in germany , offering their best season tickets at 192 euros . arsenal , a club of a similar standing in england , has the most expensive season tickets in europe at ₤ 885 -lrb- 1307 euros -rrb- , just over 1000 euros more than the most expensive german tickets , those at bayern munich . with tickets more affordable throughout germany , the hosts have a sense that the momentum can continue with crowds flocking to stadiums as the excitement heightens , culminating in huge numbers of expectant fans once the main event opens . atmosphere building as world cup approaches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the atmosphere at the world cup stadiums , and indeed germany as a whole , is something special , " explained germany coach jürgen klinsmann .
" you can sense that there is big tournament just around the corner . " if the atmosphere in the bundesliga is mirrored in the 2006 world cup , running from june 9 to july 9 , players and fans can look forward to a football fest . but it is worth remembering that world cup tickets will be far from cheap and black market prices already range from 35 euros to 600 euros on auction site ebay . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bring on the world cup , germany says the confederations cup ended with a bang on wednesday with a masterclass display by brazil .

" i am certain that i echo your own thoughts when i bring up as one of our concerns the spread of terrorism , " he said in the most extensive remarks on terrorism so far during his four-month papacy . " terrorist activity is continually recurring in various parts of the world , sowing death and destruction , and plunging many of our brothers and sisters into grief and despair , " he told the 20 muslim leaders , including three women , gathered in cologne to meet with him . it was his first major address to muslim leaders since becoming pope and benedict chose a straightforward and forceful language to underscore the immediacy of the issue .
he did not mention specific attacks and responsible terrorist parties nor did he refer directly to suicide bombings , but it appeared significant that he chose a muslim audience for his remarks on terrorism . " those who instigate and plan these attacks evidently wish to poison our relations , making use of all means , including religion , to oppose every attempt to build a peaceful , fair and serene life together , " he said , admonishing the religions of the world to work together to prevent terrorism .
if they do not , he warned , the world will be exposed to " the darkness of a new barbarism . " stressing inter-religious dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi visits the cologne synagogue the 78-year-old benedict , who met with jewish leaders in a cologne synagogue on friday and warned against the development of new forms of anti-semitism , has made inter-religious relations one of the goals of his papacy .
he has refrained from referring to the recent terror attacks in london as " anti-christian " and has instead condemned them " acts against humanity . " his speech on saturday was given in the same vein , stressing that all believers had to do their part in fighting terror : " if together we can succeed in eliminating from hearts any trace of rancor , in resisting every form of intolerance and in opposing every manifestation of violence , we will turn back the wave of cruel fanaticism that endangers the lives of so many people and hinders progress towards world peace . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany nadeem elyas , head of the central council of muslims in germany , echoed the pope 's message of reconciliation in his speech : " the islamic world also needs to recognize its historic guilt and prepare for a new constructive beginning . " " terrorism is the common enemy of christians and muslims , " he said and added that he hoped the meeting would serve as a " motivation for the individual believers in the churches and in the mosques to participate in a positive dialogue . "
he regretted that all too often , " both sides lacked the courage and the trust " to reach out to one another . a better understanding and tolerance needs to be installed through education , elyas said .
christians and muslims share many topics of common interest such as the loss of moral orientation among youth and the increasing absence of religion in young people 's lives , he pointed out . duty of religious teachers the pope agreed and stressed the duty islamic teachers had in forming young people .
" you guide muslim believers and train them in the islamic faith .
teaching is the vehicle through which ideas and convictions are transmitted .
words are highly influential in the education of the mind .
you therefore have a great responsibility for the formation of the younger generation , " he said . early in the day , the pope was reported to have told german politicians he was in favor of introducing islamic instruction into the german school curriculum as an equal to the currently catholic and protestant religion courses provided .
when the classes are offered in german in the schools , the instruction is conducted by state-trained teachers with material authorized by state educational authorities . at the moment only three federal states offer islam as an official school religion course , leaving the majority of the country 's 3.2 million muslims to turn to private -lrb- non-state supervised -rrb- koran schools for religious education .
several german bishops have called for placing islam on an equal footing with christianity in schools as a means to help integrate muslim children and control fundamentalist teaching . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope mingles with german politicians pope benedict xvi took time out of his world youth day schedule to hold talks with german chancellor gerhard schröder and his challenger in the sept .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

18 elections , angela merkel .
but the focus was clearly not politics . with the german election less than a month away , the main candidates for chancellor could have made a meeting with pope benedict xvi at the world youth day a prime media event .
instead gerhard schröder and opposition leader angela merkel chose to keep the event out of the otherwise high-intensity campaign spotlight . the meeting , which took place on saturday as a courtesy visit following the pope 's talks with german president horst köhler on friday , brought together not only the top candidates for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but also parliamentary president wolfgang thierse and state premier for north rhine-westphalia jürgen rüttgers -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the meeting with the political leaders lasted not more than an hour and left little time for photo shots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and the pope after the rather brief meeting , merkel , leader of the christian democratic union and the daughter of a protestant minister , told reporters that " it was a great joy to see the holy father . " " it was great to meet a german pope on german soil , " she said and added that she had spoken with benedict xvi on issues the pontiff considers important , such as the future of europe and current developments in germany and in the ecumenical movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder shakes hands with the pope schröder , who is also protestant - as are about a third of germans , - left the house of the cologne archdiocese without making an immediate public comment . the president of the bundestag , wolfgang thierse , on the other hand , went into great depth describing his audience with benedict xvi as " cheerful and relaxed . "
the spd member and practicing catholic said the pope was an " attentive conversational partner . " between politics and religion thierse told reporters he had mentioned the upcoming german election in september in his talk with the pope .
but when asked whether or not the pope would make use of his right to vote in the upcoming election and which party he would endorse , thierse said that was not the point of the meeting .
benedict xvi , who is the first german pope in over 500 years , is still eligible to vote in national elections . instead , thierse said he discussed the controversial issue of abortion and the church 's role in pregnancy counseling .
the president of the bundestag referred specifically to the donum vitae -lrb- protection of life -rrb- organization , which was founded by a catholic lay order in cologne to provide advice for pregnant women after the catholic church pulled out of the state-run pregnancy counseling in 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse , president of german parliament thierse , who himself is a strong advocate of the organization 's work , sees the group as part of a " noble battle fighting for the goal of improving protection for the unborn . "
in his meeting , benedict xvi underscored the vatican 's position on the issue , thierse said .
but whether or not the pope 's statements could be interpreted as a political signal to german politicians was not readily clear . islam studies in german schools the last politician to meet with the pope on saturday was north rhine-westphalia 's state premier jürgen rüttgers .
according to the cdu leader , who heads up the state hosting the world youth day , the pope stressed in his meeting the need for islamic religious studies in german schools along the lines of the curriculum currently offered for catholic and protestant pupils . muslims growing up in germany run the risk of becoming " homeless " in the sense that they no longer have ties to their homeland with its culture and religion , the pope reportedly told rüttgers .
these children must be allowed to enjoy the same access to their religious heritage as those of catholics and protestants , who make up the majority of germans .
in general , the pope said germany needs to do more to improve its moral and ethical education . for more than 20 years , muslims in germany have been pressing education leaders to introduce regular religion courses in german for their school-aged children .
german bishops have endorsed the proposal , but it has not yet been implemented nation-wide .
so far only a few model projects exist in north rhine-westphalia , lower saxony and bavaria . without the state-run religion courses in schools , parents are forced to turn to the private koran schools to provide their children with instruction and guidance on their belief system .
these schools , which do not fall under state control , all too often have the image of preventing rather than encouraging integration in the local society . benedict xvi meets with muslim leaders from the german turkish community late saturday in an effort to strengthen ties and understanding between the religions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish leaders praise pope 's temple visit after his historic visit and speech at cologne 's main synagogue , jewish leaders welcomed pope benedict xvi 's words on unity and his warning against new forms of anti-semitism .

ballack is out of contract at the end of the season and bayern have offered a lucrative four-year extension but are growing impatient at the player 's reluctance to sign on the dotted line .
" we want an answer by the end of september or beginning of october , " general manager uli hoeness told the abendzeitung .
" our offer is on the table .
there is no need for more negotiations .
he has to just say ' yes ' or ' no ' . "
german international captain ballack has been strongly linked with manchester united and real madrid and his agent , michael becker , has admitted to testing out the market value of his client .
" bayern took a long time putting their offer on the table , " becker told kicker magazine .
" it is only fair that we look around and see if this offer fits the market value . "
ballack joined bayern from bayer leverkusen in the summer of 2002 and said at the time he was not ready for a move abroad , but at 28 this could be his last chance to ply his trade in another league .
if ballack does shun bayern 's contract offer the club are likely to immediately put the german player of the year up for sale rather than risk losing him for nothing at the end of the campaign . dw-world.de dw-world : how soon before ballack moves abroad ?
following a sterling confederations cup performance the rumor mill is hot with transfer talks concerning germany 's only real soccer star .

they say that although there have been major advances , academic institutions are still not making full use of the pool of women scientists available .
female scientists sometimes find the campus environment " chilly " and may encounter " unconscious discrimination " .
they also face the extra challenge of balancing home and family life .
" the good news is we have made progress , " said lead author jo handelsman , of the university of wisconsin-madison , us .
" the bad news is we still have a long way to go to achieve equity . "
there is still a lot of covert and overt hostility on american campuses jo handelsman , university of wisconsin-madison ' challenges ' professor handelsman and her colleagues believe there are a range of challenges that can derail women and prevent them from fulfilling their full academic potential .
" there is still a lot of covert and overt hostility on american campuses , " she said .
" some of it is outright illegal behaviour , but most of it is subtle .
it makes women feel undervalued and not respected . "
professor handelsman and her colleagues say that , broadly speaking , there are four areas within which woman encounter hurdles .
the pipeline : in some fields , notably engineering and the physical sciences , fewer women are trained to the phd level and encouraged to pursue academic careers .
climate : many women scientists who left the profession said they did so because of hostility from colleagues .
according to the researchers , this atmosphere is invisible to many men , who tend " to perceive a better climate for women " .
unconscious bias : according to the report , some people within science are unconsciously biased against women .
the researchers cite a study which revealed that people evaluating work were likely to give it lower scores if they knew it was by a woman .
balancing family and work : professor handelsman claims that family responsibilities are mostly taken on by women , making it harder for them to progress in academic careers .
" the responsibilities for family caretaking continue to fall disproportionately on women , " she said .
" universities are n't set up to deal with family issues . "
the report says better child care facilities might help women get ahead child care there are a few things that could be changed , professor handelsman suggests , which would help women balance family and work , such as on-campus breast-feeding rooms and child care facilities .
alice hogan , director of the national science foundation 's advance programme , an initiative developed to analyse the impact of efforts to advance women in science , believes it is highly worth while investing in female talent .
" while we have made progress in attracting women into most science and engineering fields , we still see fewer women with doctorates , " she said .

he said : " i was lying in bed four years ago thinking what can we do with this area - one of the choices was to flatten the whole lot - but doing it this way we keep the integrity of the mansion and created a wonderful garden .
the jungle has been grown under glass in the mansion ruins " the range of plants we can grow here and the environment is unique - i think the only one of its kind in the world .
" it will extend the season for us because a lot of the flowers have been chosen specifically to be of interest during the winter months . "
the name was chosen as a homage to ninfa , a village south of rome that was left in ruins when deserted in the 14th century , but more recently has been planted as a wild garden .
the restoration of aberglasney has been on-going for 10 years since it was first bought by the restoration trust .
american based benefactor frank cabot was given his first tour around the ninfarium on friday .
benefactor frank cabot said it was a dream come true " it 's a wonderful dream realised because when we first took over the house , there were any number of schemes to make it into flats or apartments , " he said .
" when the restoration began , funds were limited and only the main part of the house could be stabilised .
" this inner courtyard was left in a very derelict state but we always had this dream of using it for some worthwhile purpose .
" it 's just the beginning .
we have to look about five to 10 years down the road when it turns into a proper jungle .
" it really should have monkeys and colourful birds flying around , the noises and everything else too . "
