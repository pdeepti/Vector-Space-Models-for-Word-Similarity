" speaking in an interview with the bavarian daily newspaper , mü n ch n er merkur , singhammer said there were plans in motion to present a draft law banning late-term abortion to the german parliament as early as next year . " no sensible human being can remain calm when a child , which could live , is aborted shortly before its birth , just because it is handicapped , " singhammer said . he added that the law was originally introduced for women whose life was considered to be at risk from a pregnancy , but that it is now much more widely used in order to prevent bringing handicapped children into the world . " we must urgently rethink the value of life , " he said . ulla ellerstorfer , the vice chairwoman of pro familia , an independent nationwide association that offers advice on issues of sexuality , pregnancy , childbirth and parenting , rejected singhammer 's demands . she said that cases where late-term abortions are performed are " extremely rare " cases of " human tragedy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.12.2005 germany releases hezbollah hijacker wanted by us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamadi was among gunmen who hijacked the twa flight in beirut in june 1985 germany has quietly released a jailed hezbollah member wanted by the us for killing an american navy diver .
the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?
hamadi , now in his late 30s , was captured in 1987 .
german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in captivity in iraq some believe they were finally successful as hamadi 's release occurred shortly before german hostage susanne osthoff was freed in iraq .
the archaeologist was taken on nov .
25 and was said by german authorities on sunday to be in safe custody .
the german foreign ministry however has denied any link between the hamadi and osthoff releases .
" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .
" the us will make every effort to see that this individual faces justice in the us . "

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?
hamadi , now in his late 30s , was captured in 1987 .
german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in captivity in iraq some believe they were finally successful as hamadi 's release occurred shortly before german hostage susanne osthoff was freed in iraq .
the archaeologist was taken on nov .
25 and was said by german authorities on sunday to be in safe custody .
the german foreign ministry however has denied any link between the hamadi and osthoff releases .
" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .
" the us will make every effort to see that this individual faces justice in the us . "
diplomats also said privately that the affair could further complicate touchy relations between the two allies that had warmed considerably since a dispute over the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany relieved by freeing of hostage , but questions remain germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .

" " this is marginally stronger than we had forecast in the autumn forecast " published in november , he told a news conference .
" we are optimistic about the outlook for growth , growth is accelerating and getting a more solid base , " he said , adding that some hoped-for positive factors " may indeed be materializing . " in particular germany , which is quickly shedding its reputation of recent years for being an economic slowcoach , may post 2006 growth above the commission 's forecast of 1.2 percent , he said . germany 's strong growth was helping to underpin the broader recovery in the euro zone , which would grow 1.3 percent this year and 1.9 percent next year , the commission said , sticking to previous forecasts . ifo predicts economy to expand by 1.7 percent in 2006 this comes a day after the ifo research institute forecast that the german economy , the biggest economy in the 12-nation bloc , is set to expand by 1.7 percent next year , nearly double the expected growth of 0.9 percent this year . previously in their joint autumn report , ifo and its five fellow research institutes diw , hwwa , iw , rwi , iwh , had been penciling in german growth of 1.2 percent in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports will again drive growth in the german economy in 2006 while growth would once again be driven primarily by exports , private consumption , traditionally the achilles ' heel of the german economy , was expected to pick up in the second half of 2006 , ifo said in its latest updated annual growth prognoses . ifo 's latest forecast is more optimistic than the german government 's official growth forecast of 1.2 percent .
" the outlook for the german economy next year remains favorable , " ifo wrote in its latest report .
" with the international environment expected to remain favorable , exports will once again be the most important pillar of growth , " the think-tank said . " investment in equipment will expand noticeably ; construction investment will not decline further ; and private consumption will also pick up somewhat , particularly in the second half of the year as consumers bring forward purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , " it said . overall , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- was expected to expand by an annual average 1.7 percent next year and even by as much as 1.9 percent when adjusted for calendar effects such as the fewer number of working days , ifo said . strong investment but effects on unemployment slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any signs of recovery in the job market would be slow to appear , ifo said but the strong acceleration in growth would need time before it had an effect on the labor market , with the total number of people on the dole expected to top the psychologically important level of five million once again in the winter months , ifo said . the average annual jobless total was expected to slip to 4.675 million in 2006 from an anticipated 4.825 million in 2005 .
and the jobless would slip to 10.7 percent from 11.1 percent , ifo predicted . as for germany 's strained public finances , which are currently in breach of eu limits , berlin would make some progress in curbing its runaway public deficit , the research institute said . under the terms of the eu 's stability and growth pact , euro zone members are not allowed to run up deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp . german deficit expected to shrink slowly but the german deficit ratio has been higher than that every year since 2002 .
ifo forecast that the ratio would indeed fall to 3.5 percent in 2005 and then to 3.2 percent in 2006 . the forecasts were made on the assumption that oil prices would average 60 dollar a barrel in 2006 after 55 dollars in 2005 and that the european central bank would raise its key rates to 2.50 percent by the summer , ifo noted . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unemployment decrease inspires hope of german recovery germany 's unemployment figures dropped in november prompting tentative forecasts of the long awaited german economic recovery .

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.12.2005 germany releases hezbollah hijacker wanted by us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamadi was among gunmen who hijacked the twa flight in beirut in june 1985 germany has quietly released a jailed hezbollah member wanted by the us for killing an american navy diver .
the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?
hamadi , now in his late 30s , was captured in 1987 .
german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in captivity in iraq some believe they were finally successful as hamadi 's release occurred shortly before german hostage susanne osthoff was freed in iraq .
the archaeologist was taken on nov .
25 and was said by german authorities on sunday to be in safe custody .
the german foreign ministry however has denied any link between the hamadi and osthoff releases .
" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .
" the us will make every effort to see that this individual faces justice in the us . "

" " this is marginally stronger than we had forecast in the autumn forecast " published in november , he told a news conference .
" we are optimistic about the outlook for growth , growth is accelerating and getting a more solid base , " he said , adding that some hoped-for positive factors " may indeed be materializing . " in particular germany , which is quickly shedding its reputation of recent years for being an economic slowcoach , may post 2006 growth above the commission 's forecast of 1.2 percent , he said . germany 's strong growth was helping to underpin the broader recovery in the euro zone , which would grow 1.3 percent this year and 1.9 percent next year , the commission said , sticking to previous forecasts . ifo predicts economy to expand by 1.7 percent in 2006 this comes a day after the ifo research institute forecast that the german economy , the biggest economy in the 12-nation bloc , is set to expand by 1.7 percent next year , nearly double the expected growth of 0.9 percent this year . previously in their joint autumn report , ifo and its five fellow research institutes diw , hwwa , iw , rwi , iwh , had been penciling in german growth of 1.2 percent in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports will again drive growth in the german economy in 2006 while growth would once again be driven primarily by exports , private consumption , traditionally the achilles ' heel of the german economy , was expected to pick up in the second half of 2006 , ifo said in its latest updated annual growth prognoses . ifo 's latest forecast is more optimistic than the german government 's official growth forecast of 1.2 percent .
" the outlook for the german economy next year remains favorable , " ifo wrote in its latest report .
" with the international environment expected to remain favorable , exports will once again be the most important pillar of growth , " the think-tank said . " investment in equipment will expand noticeably ; construction investment will not decline further ; and private consumption will also pick up somewhat , particularly in the second half of the year as consumers bring forward purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , " it said . overall , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- was expected to expand by an annual average 1.7 percent next year and even by as much as 1.9 percent when adjusted for calendar effects such as the fewer number of working days , ifo said . strong investment but effects on unemployment slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any signs of recovery in the job market would be slow to appear , ifo said but the strong acceleration in growth would need time before it had an effect on the labor market , with the total number of people on the dole expected to top the psychologically important level of five million once again in the winter months , ifo said . the average annual jobless total was expected to slip to 4.675 million in 2006 from an anticipated 4.825 million in 2005 .
and the jobless would slip to 10.7 percent from 11.1 percent , ifo predicted . as for germany 's strained public finances , which are currently in breach of eu limits , berlin would make some progress in curbing its runaway public deficit , the research institute said . under the terms of the eu 's stability and growth pact , euro zone members are not allowed to run up deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp . german deficit expected to shrink slowly but the german deficit ratio has been higher than that every year since 2002 .
ifo forecast that the ratio would indeed fall to 3.5 percent in 2005 and then to 3.2 percent in 2006 . the forecasts were made on the assumption that oil prices would average 60 dollar a barrel in 2006 after 55 dollars in 2005 and that the european central bank would raise its key rates to 2.50 percent by the summer , ifo noted . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unemployment decrease inspires hope of german recovery germany 's unemployment figures dropped in november prompting tentative forecasts of the long awaited german economic recovery .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?
hamadi , now in his late 30s , was captured in 1987 .
german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in captivity in iraq some believe they were finally successful as hamadi 's release occurred shortly before german hostage susanne osthoff was freed in iraq .
the archaeologist was taken on nov .
25 and was said by german authorities on sunday to be in safe custody .
the german foreign ministry however has denied any link between the hamadi and osthoff releases .
" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .
" the us will make every effort to see that this individual faces justice in the us . "

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

ifo forecast that the ratio would indeed fall to 3.5 percent in 2005 and then to 3.2 percent in 2006 . the forecasts were made on the assumption that oil prices would average 60 dollar a barrel in 2006 after 55 dollars in 2005 and that the european central bank would raise its key rates to 2.50 percent by the summer , ifo noted . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unemployment decrease inspires hope of german recovery germany 's unemployment figures dropped in november prompting tentative forecasts of the long awaited german economic recovery .

" speaking in an interview with the bavarian daily newspaper , mü n ch n er merkur , singhammer said there were plans in motion to present a draft law banning late-term abortion to the german parliament as early as next year . " no sensible human being can remain calm when a child , which could live , is aborted shortly before its birth , just because it is handicapped , " singhammer said . he added that the law was originally introduced for women whose life was considered to be at risk from a pregnancy , but that it is now much more widely used in order to prevent bringing handicapped children into the world . " we must urgently rethink the value of life , " he said . ulla ellerstorfer , the vice chairwoman of pro familia , an independent nationwide association that offers advice on issues of sexuality , pregnancy , childbirth and parenting , rejected singhammer 's demands . she said that cases where late-term abortions are performed are " extremely rare " cases of " human tragedy .

" speaking in an interview with the bavarian daily newspaper , mü n ch n er merkur , singhammer said there were plans in motion to present a draft law banning late-term abortion to the german parliament as early as next year . " no sensible human being can remain calm when a child , which could live , is aborted shortly before its birth , just because it is handicapped , " singhammer said . he added that the law was originally introduced for women whose life was considered to be at risk from a pregnancy , but that it is now much more widely used in order to prevent bringing handicapped children into the world . " we must urgently rethink the value of life , " he said . ulla ellerstorfer , the vice chairwoman of pro familia , an independent nationwide association that offers advice on issues of sexuality , pregnancy , childbirth and parenting , rejected singhammer 's demands . she said that cases where late-term abortions are performed are " extremely rare " cases of " human tragedy .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.12.2005 germany releases hezbollah hijacker wanted by us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamadi was among gunmen who hijacked the twa flight in beirut in june 1985 germany has quietly released a jailed hezbollah member wanted by the us for killing an american navy diver .
the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?
hamadi , now in his late 30s , was captured in 1987 .
german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in captivity in iraq some believe they were finally successful as hamadi 's release occurred shortly before german hostage susanne osthoff was freed in iraq .
the archaeologist was taken on nov .
25 and was said by german authorities on sunday to be in safe custody .
the german foreign ministry however has denied any link between the hamadi and osthoff releases .
" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .
" the us will make every effort to see that this individual faces justice in the us . "
diplomats also said privately that the affair could further complicate touchy relations between the two allies that had warmed considerably since a dispute over the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany relieved by freeing of hostage , but questions remain germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

politicians across the spectrum disagree . on friday , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble set off a firestorm across party lines after saying in a newspaper interview that he wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court . " torture is taboo and therefore information obtained through may not be used , " green parliamentarian christian ströbele told news magazine der spiegel . and the outrage was not limited to the political left . " he went a step too far , " fdp official max stadler told the magazine . schäuble : we must use such i n formatio n schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday that it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we need more and stronger tools to fight terrorism , he says " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . i n vestigatio n s i n to secret flights a n d priso n s pe n di n g schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily 's harsh proposals were rejected by the coalition the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .
schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .
schäuble 's looks to want to punish those who exhibit the behavioral patterns of members , even if no official allegiance is recognized . but german politicians are urging caution in fighting " the war on terror . " " in the war against terrorism , we have to careful not to undermine the law or trample human rights , " saarland 's premier , peter müller of the cdu told der spiegel . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror .

20 , 1955 , germany and italy signed the bilateral recruitment agreement , opening german doors to the first italian temporary " guest workers . " it was the first agreement of its kind .
and it was by no means the last .
when germany signed a treaty with italy to allow italian workers to stay in germany , the country needed labor to maintain its " economic miracle " and italy needed to find jobs for its unemployed .
and so - with a stroke of a pen and without intention - germany began its history as a land of immigration . first came the brochures in italy promising la vita nuova -lrb- a new life -rrb- complete with money and employment , something lacking in southern italy .
then came the work contracts and permits in italian and german , sparking a journey across borders for many young italian men , who in contrast to the booming economy in northern italy were finding it difficult to make ends meet in the impoverished south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accord was followed by many others that journey usually passed through verona , and later to naples to the so-called german commission , where german authorities issued the necessary documents for the would-be workers .
the bureacratic measures also included a rigorous medical check-up , a particularly hated aspect , with german employers sizing up the applicants . " we looked at height , strength and build , " recalled karl lutterbeck of a farmer 's association in baden-württemberg .
" sometimes we had them show us their hands , sometimes their teeth to see if everything was okay . " the extensive medical examinations were n't just meant to check the working ability of the italians but also to prevent contagious illness from being imported into germany .
the commission assessed some 150 italians per day .
to those it accepted , they gave papers , train tickets and some pocket money . attracting hundreds of thousands in the first five years of the program , about 686,000 italians arrived in germany .
their employers were expected to provide accommodation for them . and for many , the living quarters were the first shock in a series of many . " we arrived to barracks with shared bathrooms and kitchens in the middle , " recalled bernardino di groce who arrived in germany at 17 .
" it was for me as an italian - i do n't want to say that living conditions were so good in italy - but wooden barracks were something incomprehensible for us . " those housing conditions were later to be regulated in another accord between germany and italy in 1964 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first vacationing in italy , many italians later moved back italians went to work in the fields and building sites all over west germany and particularly in the mines of germany 's ruhr industrial heartland . they saved and sent the greater part of their earnings home to their families .
and later they brought their families to germany . it 's not known exactly how many italians came to germany in the 50 years of the program . officials estimate between 2 and 3 million .
and eventually , many left the factories and farms and mines and began their own businesses - often restaurants or ice cream shops .
and the italian lifestyle took root in germany . followed by many the italian program had many critics in the labor ministry and in the unions .
critics complained that germany 's 1 million unemployed should be given a priority .
but it was ludwig erhard , economics minister and architect of the " economic miracle " who pushed the program . it was followed by similar accords with spain and greece in 1960 , with turkey in 1961 and later with morocco , portugal , tunisia and the former yugoslavia .
in 1973 , foreign workers , also known as " guest workers " numbered about 2.6 million . and in that same year , it was over .
the government - amid the oil crisis and troubled economy - stopped the program .
for italians , it did n't matter . since the 1960s , italians could work in germany because of their membership in the european economic community .
still , a majority of italians - about 90 percent - returned to italy .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

animal protection zealots would be the first to warn want-to-please parents not to buy pets for their youngsters ' stockings .
but one german mother took the " a puppy is not just for christmas " edict a little too far . a 19-year-old girl from the city of aachen was gearing up to spend christmas with her family , which included two guinea pigs , a dog and seven puppies , when her mother blighted her plans by performing an act so mean in spirit that it could have been the work of ebenezer scrooge himself . knowing full well the extent of her daughter 's affection for her menagerie , which she kept ensconced in her bedroom , the bespoke mother waited for her animal-loving child to leave the house for the day .
once the coast was clear , she stole up the stairs and abducted the squealing guinea pigs , mummy dog and her entire pack of whimpering baby hounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anyone want a guinea pig ?
she then bundled them into her car and took them on a one-way trip to the local animal refuge center where she handed them over for good .
in a bid to make sure her awful deed could not be reversed , she signed a document to say she would , under no circumstances take back her daughter 's entourage of four-legged friends . upon her return to an eerily silent bedroom , the daughter was horrified to discover all nine of her wards gone .
when she turned to her mother and found guilt rather than sympathy or confusion about the mysterious disappearance , the teenager wanted retribution .
she stomped off to the local police station where she pressed charges against her misanthropic mother . police are investigating the case , and say they hope that mother and daughter can reach some kind of out of court settlement . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from animal antics and wacky inventions to celebrity gaffes and cultural idiosyncrasies - dw-world 's " from the fringe " brings you news on weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

and the italian lifestyle took root in germany . followed by many the italian program had many critics in the labor ministry and in the unions .
critics complained that germany 's 1 million unemployed should be given a priority .
but it was ludwig erhard , economics minister and architect of the " economic miracle " who pushed the program . it was followed by similar accords with spain and greece in 1960 , with turkey in 1961 and later with morocco , portugal , tunisia and the former yugoslavia .
in 1973 , foreign workers , also known as " guest workers " numbered about 2.6 million . and in that same year , it was over .
the government - amid the oil crisis and troubled economy - stopped the program .
for italians , it did n't matter . since the 1960s , italians could work in germany because of their membership in the european economic community .
still , a majority of italians - about 90 percent - returned to italy .
it was the same with the spanish and portuguese workers . today , about 7 million foreigners live in germany , the majority from turkey . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking back at german-italian relations a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift .

when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .

" we must urgently rethink the value of life , " he said . ulla ellerstorfer , the vice chairwoman of pro familia , an independent nationwide association that offers advice on issues of sexuality , pregnancy , childbirth and parenting , rejected singhammer 's demands . she said that cases where late-term abortions are performed are " extremely rare " cases of " human tragedy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.12.2005 deutsche bank boss could be back in the dock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef ackermann might not be so lucky the second time around germany 's highest court will decide wednesday whether to re-open the controversial mannesmann case - a decision that may see the head of germany 's largest bank , josef ackermann , in court again . deutsche bank chief josef ackermann could find his future hanging in the balance this week if germany 's highest court decides to re-open the long-running mannesmann case in which the highly unpopular swiss banker is one of the main defendants . ackermann has long been under fire for brutally slashing thousands of jobs at a time when deutsche bank was turning in record profits and he himself was the highest paid chief executive in the country . and he was heavily criticized for a series of subsequent public relations disasters . most recently , he took more flak following the decision by deutsche bank 's real estate arm to temporarily freeze one of its real estate funds . case likely to be re-opened despite the seemingly never-ending controversy , ackermann has so far held on to his seat as head of germany 's biggest bank . but observers say his position could become untenable if the bundesgerichtshof or federal supreme court rules on wednesday that the so-called mannesmann affair has to be re-opened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company has been surrounded by controversy all the indications appear to point to a revival of the case , in which ackermann and five other top executives are accused of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle in 2000 . ackermann 's co-defendants are former mannesmann chairman klaus esser , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk , the former head of the powerful ig metall labour union , klaus zwickel , and two others , jürgen ladberg and dietmar drost . judge sceptical of acquittal in july 2004 , the six men were acquitted of breaking the law by approving a total 111.5 million deutsch marks -lrb- 57 million euros , $ 68 million -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives . esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros . a court in düsseldorf ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . the prosecution had been demanding prison sentences of varying length with or without probation for the defendants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case could take more than one year but already at the end of october , supreme court judge klaus tolksdorf expressed scepticism about the original acquittal . and if the karlsruhe court does finally decide on wednesday to re-open the case , ackermann will find himself in the dock once again . a repeat of the original trial , in which ackermann as the country 's most powerful banker was compelled to attend court twice a week over a period of six months , would be unsupportable for a bank of deutsche bank 's standing , observers say . the defense argues that the payouts were in line with international practice and reflected the increase in value of mannesmann shares during the 188-billion-euro takeover battle with vodafone . but the prosecution insists the payments were nothing more than " presents " of money that was not the supervisory board 's to distribute . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-mannesmann chief under fire former mannesmann chairman klaus esser faced fresh accusations of wrongdoing by german prosecutors friday in their appeal of his acquittal last year over the takeover of the firm by british mobile phone giant vodafone .

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?
hamadi , now in his late 30s , was captured in 1987 .
german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in captivity in iraq some believe they were finally successful as hamadi 's release occurred shortly before german hostage susanne osthoff was freed in iraq .

" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .
" the us will make every effort to see that this individual faces justice in the us . "

" " this is marginally stronger than we had forecast in the autumn forecast " published in november , he told a news conference .
" we are optimistic about the outlook for growth , growth is accelerating and getting a more solid base , " he said , adding that some hoped-for positive factors " may indeed be materializing . " in particular germany , which is quickly shedding its reputation of recent years for being an economic slowcoach , may post 2006 growth above the commission 's forecast of 1.2 percent , he said . germany 's strong growth was helping to underpin the broader recovery in the euro zone , which would grow 1.3 percent this year and 1.9 percent next year , the commission said , sticking to previous forecasts . ifo predicts economy to expand by 1.7 percent in 2006 this comes a day after the ifo research institute forecast that the german economy , the biggest economy in the 12-nation bloc , is set to expand by 1.7 percent next year , nearly double the expected growth of 0.9 percent this year . previously in their joint autumn report , ifo and its five fellow research institutes diw , hwwa , iw , rwi , iwh , had been penciling in german growth of 1.2 percent in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports will again drive growth in the german economy in 2006 while growth would once again be driven primarily by exports , private consumption , traditionally the achilles ' heel of the german economy , was expected to pick up in the second half of 2006 , ifo said in its latest updated annual growth prognoses . ifo 's latest forecast is more optimistic than the german government 's official growth forecast of 1.2 percent .
" the outlook for the german economy next year remains favorable , " ifo wrote in its latest report .
" with the international environment expected to remain favorable , exports will once again be the most important pillar of growth , " the think-tank said . " investment in equipment will expand noticeably ; construction investment will not decline further ; and private consumption will also pick up somewhat , particularly in the second half of the year as consumers bring forward purchases ahead of the planned rise in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , " it said . overall , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- was expected to expand by an annual average 1.7 percent next year and even by as much as 1.9 percent when adjusted for calendar effects such as the fewer number of working days , ifo said . strong investment but effects on unemployment slow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any signs of recovery in the job market would be slow to appear , ifo said but the strong acceleration in growth would need time before it had an effect on the labor market , with the total number of people on the dole expected to top the psychologically important level of five million once again in the winter months , ifo said . the average annual jobless total was expected to slip to 4.675 million in 2006 from an anticipated 4.825 million in 2005 .
and the jobless would slip to 10.7 percent from 11.1 percent , ifo predicted . as for germany 's strained public finances , which are currently in breach of eu limits , berlin would make some progress in curbing its runaway public deficit , the research institute said . under the terms of the eu 's stability and growth pact , euro zone members are not allowed to run up deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp . german deficit expected to shrink slowly but the german deficit ratio has been higher than that every year since 2002 .
ifo forecast that the ratio would indeed fall to 3.5 percent in 2005 and then to 3.2 percent in 2006 . the forecasts were made on the assumption that oil prices would average 60 dollar a barrel in 2006 after 55 dollars in 2005 and that the european central bank would raise its key rates to 2.50 percent by the summer , ifo noted . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unemployment decrease inspires hope of german recovery germany 's unemployment figures dropped in november prompting tentative forecasts of the long awaited german economic recovery .

when she turned to her mother and found guilt rather than sympathy or confusion about the mysterious disappearance , the teenager wanted retribution .
she stomped off to the local police station where she pressed charges against her misanthropic mother . police are investigating the case , and say they hope that mother and daughter can reach some kind of out of court settlement . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from animal antics and wacky inventions to celebrity gaffes and cultural idiosyncrasies - dw-world 's " from the fringe " brings you news on weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "

ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .

a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

politicians across the spectrum disagree . on friday , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble set off a firestorm across party lines after saying in a newspaper interview that he wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court . " torture is taboo and therefore information obtained through may not be used , " green parliamentarian christian ströbele told news magazine der spiegel . and the outrage was not limited to the political left . " he went a step too far , " fdp official max stadler told the magazine . schäuble : we must use such i n formatio n schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday that it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we need more and stronger tools to fight terrorism , he says " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . i n vestigatio n s i n to secret flights a n d priso n s pe n di n g schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily 's harsh proposals were rejected by the coalition the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .

when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .

when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 la vita nuova : marking 50 years of italian " guests " in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 700,000 italians came to germany to work on dec .
20 , 1955 , germany and italy signed the bilateral recruitment agreement , opening german doors to the first italian temporary " guest workers . " it was the first agreement of its kind .
and it was by no means the last .
when germany signed a treaty with italy to allow italian workers to stay in germany , the country needed labor to maintain its " economic miracle " and italy needed to find jobs for its unemployed .
and so - with a stroke of a pen and without intention - germany began its history as a land of immigration . first came the brochures in italy promising la vita nuova -lrb- a new life -rrb- complete with money and employment , something lacking in southern italy .
then came the work contracts and permits in italian and german , sparking a journey across borders for many young italian men , who in contrast to the booming economy in northern italy were finding it difficult to make ends meet in the impoverished south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accord was followed by many others that journey usually passed through verona , and later to naples to the so-called german commission , where german authorities issued the necessary documents for the would-be workers .
the bureacratic measures also included a rigorous medical check-up , a particularly hated aspect , with german employers sizing up the applicants . " we looked at height , strength and build , " recalled karl lutterbeck of a farmer 's association in baden-württemberg .
" sometimes we had them show us their hands , sometimes their teeth to see if everything was okay . " the extensive medical examinations were n't just meant to check the working ability of the italians but also to prevent contagious illness from being imported into germany .
the commission assessed some 150 italians per day .
to those it accepted , they gave papers , train tickets and some pocket money . attracting hundreds of thousands in the first five years of the program , about 686,000 italians arrived in germany .
their employers were expected to provide accommodation for them . and for many , the living quarters were the first shock in a series of many . " we arrived to barracks with shared bathrooms and kitchens in the middle , " recalled bernardino di groce who arrived in germany at 17 .
" it was for me as an italian - i do n't want to say that living conditions were so good in italy - but wooden barracks were something incomprehensible for us . " those housing conditions were later to be regulated in another accord between germany and italy in 1964 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first vacationing in italy , many italians later moved back italians went to work in the fields and building sites all over west germany and particularly in the mines of germany 's ruhr industrial heartland . they saved and sent the greater part of their earnings home to their families .
and later they brought their families to germany . it 's not known exactly how many italians came to germany in the 50 years of the program . officials estimate between 2 and 3 million .
and eventually , many left the factories and farms and mines and began their own businesses - often restaurants or ice cream shops .
and the italian lifestyle took root in germany . followed by many the italian program had many critics in the labor ministry and in the unions .
critics complained that germany 's 1 million unemployed should be given a priority .
but it was ludwig erhard , economics minister and architect of the " economic miracle " who pushed the program . it was followed by similar accords with spain and greece in 1960 , with turkey in 1961 and later with morocco , portugal , tunisia and the former yugoslavia .
in 1973 , foreign workers , also known as " guest workers " numbered about 2.6 million . and in that same year , it was over .
the government - amid the oil crisis and troubled economy - stopped the program .
for italians , it did n't matter . since the 1960s , italians could work in germany because of their membership in the european economic community .
still , a majority of italians - about 90 percent - returned to italy .
it was the same with the spanish and portuguese workers . today , about 7 million foreigners live in germany , the majority from turkey . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking back at german-italian relations a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift .

20 , 1955 , germany and italy signed the bilateral recruitment agreement , opening german doors to the first italian temporary " guest workers . " it was the first agreement of its kind .
and it was by no means the last .
when germany signed a treaty with italy to allow italian workers to stay in germany , the country needed labor to maintain its " economic miracle " and italy needed to find jobs for its unemployed .
and so - with a stroke of a pen and without intention - germany began its history as a land of immigration . first came the brochures in italy promising la vita nuova -lrb- a new life -rrb- complete with money and employment , something lacking in southern italy .
then came the work contracts and permits in italian and german , sparking a journey across borders for many young italian men , who in contrast to the booming economy in northern italy were finding it difficult to make ends meet in the impoverished south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accord was followed by many others that journey usually passed through verona , and later to naples to the so-called german commission , where german authorities issued the necessary documents for the would-be workers .
the bureacratic measures also included a rigorous medical check-up , a particularly hated aspect , with german employers sizing up the applicants . " we looked at height , strength and build , " recalled karl lutterbeck of a farmer 's association in baden-württemberg .
" sometimes we had them show us their hands , sometimes their teeth to see if everything was okay . " the extensive medical examinations were n't just meant to check the working ability of the italians but also to prevent contagious illness from being imported into germany .
the commission assessed some 150 italians per day .
to those it accepted , they gave papers , train tickets and some pocket money . attracting hundreds of thousands in the first five years of the program , about 686,000 italians arrived in germany .
their employers were expected to provide accommodation for them . and for many , the living quarters were the first shock in a series of many . " we arrived to barracks with shared bathrooms and kitchens in the middle , " recalled bernardino di groce who arrived in germany at 17 .
" it was for me as an italian - i do n't want to say that living conditions were so good in italy - but wooden barracks were something incomprehensible for us . " those housing conditions were later to be regulated in another accord between germany and italy in 1964 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first vacationing in italy , many italians later moved back italians went to work in the fields and building sites all over west germany and particularly in the mines of germany 's ruhr industrial heartland . they saved and sent the greater part of their earnings home to their families .
and later they brought their families to germany . it 's not known exactly how many italians came to germany in the 50 years of the program . officials estimate between 2 and 3 million .
and eventually , many left the factories and farms and mines and began their own businesses - often restaurants or ice cream shops .
and the italian lifestyle took root in germany . followed by many the italian program had many critics in the labor ministry and in the unions .
critics complained that germany 's 1 million unemployed should be given a priority .
but it was ludwig erhard , economics minister and architect of the " economic miracle " who pushed the program . it was followed by similar accords with spain and greece in 1960 , with turkey in 1961 and later with morocco , portugal , tunisia and the former yugoslavia .
in 1973 , foreign workers , also known as " guest workers " numbered about 2.6 million . and in that same year , it was over .
the government - amid the oil crisis and troubled economy - stopped the program .
for italians , it did n't matter . since the 1960s , italians could work in germany because of their membership in the european economic community .
still , a majority of italians - about 90 percent - returned to italy .
it was the same with the spanish and portuguese workers . today , about 7 million foreigners live in germany , the majority from turkey . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking back at german-italian relations a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift .
-lrb- july 16 , 2003 -rrb- germans head south in search of jobs as euroskeptics across the continent smugly salute france and holland for crushing the eu constitution ratification process , a migratory trend among german workers validates the benefits of cross border labor markets .

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?
hamadi , now in his late 30s , was captured in 1987 .
german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in captivity in iraq some believe they were finally successful as hamadi 's release occurred shortly before german hostage susanne osthoff was freed in iraq .
the archaeologist was taken on nov .
25 and was said by german authorities on sunday to be in safe custody .
the german foreign ministry however has denied any link between the hamadi and osthoff releases .
" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .
" the us will make every effort to see that this individual faces justice in the us . "

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?
hamadi , now in his late 30s , was captured in 1987 .
german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in captivity in iraq some believe they were finally successful as hamadi 's release occurred shortly before german hostage susanne osthoff was freed in iraq .
the archaeologist was taken on nov .
25 and was said by german authorities on sunday to be in safe custody .
the german foreign ministry however has denied any link between the hamadi and osthoff releases .
" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .
" the us will make every effort to see that this individual faces justice in the us . "
diplomats also said privately that the affair could further complicate touchy relations between the two allies that had warmed considerably since a dispute over the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany relieved by freeing of hostage , but questions remain germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .

and it was by no means the last .
when germany signed a treaty with italy to allow italian workers to stay in germany , the country needed labor to maintain its " economic miracle " and italy needed to find jobs for its unemployed .
and so - with a stroke of a pen and without intention - germany began its history as a land of immigration . first came the brochures in italy promising la vita nuova -lrb- a new life -rrb- complete with money and employment , something lacking in southern italy .
then came the work contracts and permits in italian and german , sparking a journey across borders for many young italian men , who in contrast to the booming economy in northern italy were finding it difficult to make ends meet in the impoverished south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accord was followed by many others that journey usually passed through verona , and later to naples to the so-called german commission , where german authorities issued the necessary documents for the would-be workers .
the bureacratic measures also included a rigorous medical check-up , a particularly hated aspect , with german employers sizing up the applicants . " we looked at height , strength and build , " recalled karl lutterbeck of a farmer 's association in baden-württemberg .
" sometimes we had them show us their hands , sometimes their teeth to see if everything was okay . " the extensive medical examinations were n't just meant to check the working ability of the italians but also to prevent contagious illness from being imported into germany .
the commission assessed some 150 italians per day .
to those it accepted , they gave papers , train tickets and some pocket money . attracting hundreds of thousands in the first five years of the program , about 686,000 italians arrived in germany .
their employers were expected to provide accommodation for them . and for many , the living quarters were the first shock in a series of many . " we arrived to barracks with shared bathrooms and kitchens in the middle , " recalled bernardino di groce who arrived in germany at 17 .
" it was for me as an italian - i do n't want to say that living conditions were so good in italy - but wooden barracks were something incomprehensible for us .

and eventually , many left the factories and farms and mines and began their own businesses - often restaurants or ice cream shops .
and the italian lifestyle took root in germany . followed by many the italian program had many critics in the labor ministry and in the unions .
critics complained that germany 's 1 million unemployed should be given a priority .
but it was ludwig erhard , economics minister and architect of the " economic miracle " who pushed the program . it was followed by similar accords with spain and greece in 1960 , with turkey in 1961 and later with morocco , portugal , tunisia and the former yugoslavia .
in 1973 , foreign workers , also known as " guest workers " numbered about 2.6 million . and in that same year , it was over .
the government - amid the oil crisis and troubled economy - stopped the program .
for italians , it did n't matter . since the 1960s , italians could work in germany because of their membership in the european economic community .

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?

german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .

the german foreign ministry however has denied any link between the hamadi and osthoff releases .
" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?

" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "

one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .

20 , 1955 , germany and italy signed the bilateral recruitment agreement , opening german doors to the first italian temporary " guest workers . " it was the first agreement of its kind .
and it was by no means the last .
when germany signed a treaty with italy to allow italian workers to stay in germany , the country needed labor to maintain its " economic miracle " and italy needed to find jobs for its unemployed .
and so - with a stroke of a pen and without intention - germany began its history as a land of immigration . first came the brochures in italy promising la vita nuova -lrb- a new life -rrb- complete with money and employment , something lacking in southern italy .
then came the work contracts and permits in italian and german , sparking a journey across borders for many young italian men , who in contrast to the booming economy in northern italy were finding it difficult to make ends meet in the impoverished south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accord was followed by many others that journey usually passed through verona , and later to naples to the so-called german commission , where german authorities issued the necessary documents for the would-be workers .
the bureacratic measures also included a rigorous medical check-up , a particularly hated aspect , with german employers sizing up the applicants . " we looked at height , strength and build , " recalled karl lutterbeck of a farmer 's association in baden-württemberg .
" sometimes we had them show us their hands , sometimes their teeth to see if everything was okay . " the extensive medical examinations were n't just meant to check the working ability of the italians but also to prevent contagious illness from being imported into germany .
the commission assessed some 150 italians per day .
to those it accepted , they gave papers , train tickets and some pocket money . attracting hundreds of thousands in the first five years of the program , about 686,000 italians arrived in germany .
their employers were expected to provide accommodation for them . and for many , the living quarters were the first shock in a series of many . " we arrived to barracks with shared bathrooms and kitchens in the middle , " recalled bernardino di groce who arrived in germany at 17 .
" it was for me as an italian - i do n't want to say that living conditions were so good in italy - but wooden barracks were something incomprehensible for us . " those housing conditions were later to be regulated in another accord between germany and italy in 1964 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first vacationing in italy , many italians later moved back italians went to work in the fields and building sites all over west germany and particularly in the mines of germany 's ruhr industrial heartland . they saved and sent the greater part of their earnings home to their families .
and later they brought their families to germany . it 's not known exactly how many italians came to germany in the 50 years of the program . officials estimate between 2 and 3 million .
and eventually , many left the factories and farms and mines and began their own businesses - often restaurants or ice cream shops .
and the italian lifestyle took root in germany . followed by many the italian program had many critics in the labor ministry and in the unions .
critics complained that germany 's 1 million unemployed should be given a priority .
but it was ludwig erhard , economics minister and architect of the " economic miracle " who pushed the program . it was followed by similar accords with spain and greece in 1960 , with turkey in 1961 and later with morocco , portugal , tunisia and the former yugoslavia .
in 1973 , foreign workers , also known as " guest workers " numbered about 2.6 million . and in that same year , it was over .
the government - amid the oil crisis and troubled economy - stopped the program .
for italians , it did n't matter . since the 1960s , italians could work in germany because of their membership in the european economic community .
still , a majority of italians - about 90 percent - returned to italy .
it was the same with the spanish and portuguese workers . today , about 7 million foreigners live in germany , the majority from turkey . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking back at german-italian relations a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?

but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

politicians across the spectrum disagree . on friday , germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble set off a firestorm across party lines after saying in a newspaper interview that he wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court . " torture is taboo and therefore information obtained through may not be used , " green parliamentarian christian ströbele told news magazine der spiegel . and the outrage was not limited to the political left . " he went a step too far , " fdp official max stadler told the magazine . schäuble : we must use such i n formatio n schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday that it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we need more and stronger tools to fight terrorism , he says " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . i n vestigatio n s i n to secret flights a n d priso n s pe n di n g schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily 's harsh proposals were rejected by the coalition the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .
schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .
schäuble 's looks to want to punish those who exhibit the behavioral patterns of members , even if no official allegiance is recognized . but german politicians are urging caution in fighting " the war on terror . " " in the war against terrorism , we have to careful not to undermine the law or trample human rights , " saarland 's premier , peter müller of the cdu told der spiegel . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .

animal protection zealots would be the first to warn want-to-please parents not to buy pets for their youngsters ' stockings .
but one german mother took the " a puppy is not just for christmas " edict a little too far . a 19-year-old girl from the city of aachen was gearing up to spend christmas with her family , which included two guinea pigs , a dog and seven puppies , when her mother blighted her plans by performing an act so mean in spirit that it could have been the work of ebenezer scrooge himself . knowing full well the extent of her daughter 's affection for her menagerie , which she kept ensconced in her bedroom , the bespoke mother waited for her animal-loving child to leave the house for the day .
once the coast was clear , she stole up the stairs and abducted the squealing guinea pigs , mummy dog and her entire pack of whimpering baby hounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anyone want a guinea pig ?
she then bundled them into her car and took them on a one-way trip to the local animal refuge center where she handed them over for good .
in a bid to make sure her awful deed could not be reversed , she signed a document to say she would , under no circumstances take back her daughter 's entourage of four-legged friends . upon her return to an eerily silent bedroom , the daughter was horrified to discover all nine of her wards gone .
when she turned to her mother and found guilt rather than sympathy or confusion about the mysterious disappearance , the teenager wanted retribution .
she stomped off to the local police station where she pressed charges against her misanthropic mother . police are investigating the case , and say they hope that mother and daughter can reach some kind of out of court settlement . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from animal antics and wacky inventions to celebrity gaffes and cultural idiosyncrasies - dw-world 's " from the fringe " brings you news on weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

" speaking in an interview with the bavarian daily newspaper , mü n ch n er merkur , singhammer said there were plans in motion to present a draft law banning late-term abortion to the german parliament as early as next year . " no sensible human being can remain calm when a child , which could live , is aborted shortly before its birth , just because it is handicapped , " singhammer said . he added that the law was originally introduced for women whose life was considered to be at risk from a pregnancy , but that it is now much more widely used in order to prevent bringing handicapped children into the world . " we must urgently rethink the value of life , " he said . ulla ellerstorfer , the vice chairwoman of pro familia , an independent nationwide association that offers advice on issues of sexuality , pregnancy , childbirth and parenting , rejected singhammer 's demands . she said that cases where late-term abortions are performed are " extremely rare " cases of " human tragedy .

the timing - just days after the freeing of a german hostage in iraq - has raised uncomfortable questions . apparently ignoring washington 's extradition request for mohammed ali hamadi , german authorities have secretly released the lebanese hezbollah member who was serving a life sentence in the country for the hijacking of a twa jet and for the murder of a us navy diver .
german prosecutors confirmed the release of mohammed ali hamadi , now in his late 30s , to the associated press and said he was flown back to lebanon last week .
hamadi was convicted in 1989 by a german court of killing us navy diver robert dean stethem during the 1985 hijacking of a twa flight diverted to beirut .
he was sentenced to life without parole .
his sentence is one germany reserves for the most serious and cruel crimes .
it is difficult but not impossible to release someone who receives such a sentence after 15 years .
hamadi served 19 years of his sentence .
hamadi 's other brother , abbas ali , was sentenced to 13 years in prison for plotting the kidnapping of two germans in lebanon in the hope of forcing the release of his brother .
he was released from jail after serving his term .
a tradeoff between hamadi and osthoff ?
hamadi , now in his late 30s , was captured in 1987 .
german officials had tried unsuccessfully in the late 1980s to use him as a bargaining chip to free german hostages held in lebanon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was released after three weeks in captivity in iraq some believe they were finally successful as hamadi 's release occurred shortly before german hostage susanne osthoff was freed in iraq .
the archaeologist was taken on nov .
25 and was said by german authorities on sunday to be in safe custody .
the german foreign ministry however has denied any link between the hamadi and osthoff releases .
" there is no connection between these two cases , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told reuters .
but a lebanese source told reuters that a senior german intelligence officer visited damascus early this month but did not disclose the purpose of the trip .
syria is a key backer of hezbollah and hamadi 's brother , abdul-hadi , was a senior security official of the group .
us disappointed by hamadi release meanwhile , the release has disappointed washington where us prosecutors had indicted hamadi for the murder of 23-year-old us navy diver robert dean stethem , one of the passengers on board while the twa plane was in beirut .
the us had requested extradition if he was released . " we are disappointed by the fact that he was released before the end of his sentence , " state department spokesman sean mccormack said , referring to mohammed ali hamadi .
" the us will make every effort to see that this individual faces justice in the us . "
diplomats also said privately that the affair could further complicate touchy relations between the two allies that had warmed considerably since a dispute over the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany relieved by freeing of hostage , but questions remain germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .

20 , 1955 , germany and italy signed the bilateral recruitment agreement , opening german doors to the first italian temporary " guest workers . " it was the first agreement of its kind .
and it was by no means the last .
when germany signed a treaty with italy to allow italian workers to stay in germany , the country needed labor to maintain its " economic miracle " and italy needed to find jobs for its unemployed .
and so - with a stroke of a pen and without intention - germany began its history as a land of immigration . first came the brochures in italy promising la vita nuova -lrb- a new life -rrb- complete with money and employment , something lacking in southern italy .
then came the work contracts and permits in italian and german , sparking a journey across borders for many young italian men , who in contrast to the booming economy in northern italy were finding it difficult to make ends meet in the impoverished south . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accord was followed by many others that journey usually passed through verona , and later to naples to the so-called german commission , where german authorities issued the necessary documents for the would-be workers .
the bureacratic measures also included a rigorous medical check-up , a particularly hated aspect , with german employers sizing up the applicants . " we looked at height , strength and build , " recalled karl lutterbeck of a farmer 's association in baden-württemberg .
" sometimes we had them show us their hands , sometimes their teeth to see if everything was okay . " the extensive medical examinations were n't just meant to check the working ability of the italians but also to prevent contagious illness from being imported into germany .
the commission assessed some 150 italians per day .
to those it accepted , they gave papers , train tickets and some pocket money . attracting hundreds of thousands in the first five years of the program , about 686,000 italians arrived in germany .
their employers were expected to provide accommodation for them . and for many , the living quarters were the first shock in a series of many . " we arrived to barracks with shared bathrooms and kitchens in the middle , " recalled bernardino di groce who arrived in germany at 17 .
" it was for me as an italian - i do n't want to say that living conditions were so good in italy - but wooden barracks were something incomprehensible for us . " those housing conditions were later to be regulated in another accord between germany and italy in 1964 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first vacationing in italy , many italians later moved back italians went to work in the fields and building sites all over west germany and particularly in the mines of germany 's ruhr industrial heartland . they saved and sent the greater part of their earnings home to their families .
and later they brought their families to germany . it 's not known exactly how many italians came to germany in the 50 years of the program . officials estimate between 2 and 3 million .
and eventually , many left the factories and farms and mines and began their own businesses - often restaurants or ice cream shops .
and the italian lifestyle took root in germany . followed by many the italian program had many critics in the labor ministry and in the unions .
critics complained that germany 's 1 million unemployed should be given a priority .
but it was ludwig erhard , economics minister and architect of the " economic miracle " who pushed the program . it was followed by similar accords with spain and greece in 1960 , with turkey in 1961 and later with morocco , portugal , tunisia and the former yugoslavia .
in 1973 , foreign workers , also known as " guest workers " numbered about 2.6 million . and in that same year , it was over .
the government - amid the oil crisis and troubled economy - stopped the program .
for italians , it did n't matter . since the 1960s , italians could work in germany because of their membership in the european economic community .
still , a majority of italians - about 90 percent - returned to italy .
it was the same with the spanish and portuguese workers . today , about 7 million foreigners live in germany , the majority from turkey . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking back at german-italian relations a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift .

" speaking in an interview with the bavarian daily newspaper , mü n ch n er merkur , singhammer said there were plans in motion to present a draft law banning late-term abortion to the german parliament as early as next year . " no sensible human being can remain calm when a child , which could live , is aborted shortly before its birth , just because it is handicapped , " singhammer said . he added that the law was originally introduced for women whose life was considered to be at risk from a pregnancy , but that it is now much more widely used in order to prevent bringing handicapped children into the world . " we must urgently rethink the value of life , " he said . ulla ellerstorfer , the vice chairwoman of pro familia , an independent nationwide association that offers advice on issues of sexuality , pregnancy , childbirth and parenting , rejected singhammer 's demands . she said that cases where late-term abortions are performed are " extremely rare " cases of " human tragedy .

when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 20.12.2005 out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxed in each others company , merkel and berlusconi look ahead to a friendlier future gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy . german chancellor angela merkel met with italian premier minister silvio berlusconi on monday evening during a short visit to rome and took the opportunity to stress that efforts should be made to improve relations between their two countries which suffered during the term of office of her predecessor . the atmosphere between the two leaders was already a marked improvement on the strained and barely concealed animosity towards the italian government that punctuated the last days of the schröder administration .
merkel and berlusconi were relaxed in each others company and it was a clear indication that rome was a lot happier at the outcome of the german election this time around . the italian prime minister himself was a lot more open in the meeting than he usually is with leaders , aides said .
over dinner , berlusconi told merkel that he had been following the events surrounding the establishment of the new coalition government in germany very closely and had a positive feeling about the future . perso n al a n imosity fuelled past political spats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and berlusconi very rarely saw eye-to-eye the underlying message was that berlusconi was glad to see the back of schröder who had been on the opposite side of the fence during the iraq war and whose government officials had on occasion sparred and publicly argued with their italian counterparts during the second half of his chancellorship . on the whole , however , the working relationship between berlin and rome had been mostly cordial but the personal dislike between the two leaders had often over spilled into the political domain , especially over iraq . the subject of iraq is , of course , one that both merkel and berlusconi will have to breach in time to make way for a new period of calm between the two nations .
the german chancellor avoided the subject directly but made it clear that she would be working towards a more fruitful relationship with the palazzo chigi by strengthening economic and industrial bonds . merkel stresses commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exuding self-confidence , angela merkel added rome to her list of conquests " i 've come here to introduce myself .
relations between our two countries are traditionally very good , " merkel told reporters after briefly meeting with president carlo azeglio ciampi before dinner .
" we know each other from many conversations that we have many common points of views , that we represent a similar social model . " we know that europe faces big challenges and that we in the european union - and germany and italy have always been at the heart of that - must be economically strong .
we must be strong in the areas of research , development and technology , so we in europe do not have to rely on competitors in asia or elsewhere in the world . " she added that the germans and italians also held similar views on the fight against terrorism and the search for a common european policy against unlawful immigration - subjects that would be addressed in more detail during future meetings . berlusco n i looks to cooperatio n o n foreig n policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on opposite sides over iraq , berlusconi hopes germany and italy can now come together berlusconi hinted at the split over iraq but was uncharacteristically restrained in his reference to it . " we 'll vigorously resume together trans-atlantic policy , putting aside the differences of the past , especially on the iraq issue , " berlusconi said .
" with chancellor merkel 's government , we will have the possibility of cooperation on foreign policy . " merkel arrived in italy on a wave of admiration based on her understated summit-saving performance at the eu 's budget meeting at the weekend and the self-confidence gained from that was evident to see during the short visit . italia n charm the ici n g o n the cake berlusconi did n't pass up the opportunity to charm merkel further , once again praising her for her role as mediator at the summit .
it is understood that he told the chancellor of his admiration for her vision during the summit and her female instinct for coming to pragmatic solutions faster than male counterparts . after dinner , berlusconi made his private quarters in his office available for the chancellor to freshen up before her flight back to berlin and bid farewell by extending his hospitality in italy to merkel in the hope that she would regularly enjoy her holidays there as much as her predecessor did . it seemed that , although some things had changed and more needed to do so , the italian prime minister was keen to promote continuity after all . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder and berlusconi lost in translation german chancellor gerhard schröder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have had a number of misunderstandings over the years .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

the bureacratic measures also included a rigorous medical check-up , a particularly hated aspect , with german employers sizing up the applicants . " we looked at height , strength and build , " recalled karl lutterbeck of a farmer 's association in baden-württemberg .
" sometimes we had them show us their hands , sometimes their teeth to see if everything was okay . " the extensive medical examinations were n't just meant to check the working ability of the italians but also to prevent contagious illness from being imported into germany .
the commission assessed some 150 italians per day .
to those it accepted , they gave papers , train tickets and some pocket money . attracting hundreds of thousands in the first five years of the program , about 686,000 italians arrived in germany .
their employers were expected to provide accommodation for them . and for many , the living quarters were the first shock in a series of many . " we arrived to barracks with shared bathrooms and kitchens in the middle , " recalled bernardino di groce who arrived in germany at 17 .
" it was for me as an italian - i do n't want to say that living conditions were so good in italy - but wooden barracks were something incomprehensible for us . " those housing conditions were later to be regulated in another accord between germany and italy in 1964 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at first vacationing in italy , many italians later moved back italians went to work in the fields and building sites all over west germany and particularly in the mines of germany 's ruhr industrial heartland . they saved and sent the greater part of their earnings home to their families .
and later they brought their families to germany . it 's not known exactly how many italians came to germany in the 50 years of the program . officials estimate between 2 and 3 million .
and eventually , many left the factories and farms and mines and began their own businesses - often restaurants or ice cream shops .
and the italian lifestyle took root in germany . followed by many the italian program had many critics in the labor ministry and in the unions .
critics complained that germany 's 1 million unemployed should be given a priority .
but it was ludwig erhard , economics minister and architect of the " economic miracle " who pushed the program . it was followed by similar accords with spain and greece in 1960 , with turkey in 1961 and later with morocco , portugal , tunisia and the former yugoslavia .
in 1973 , foreign workers , also known as " guest workers " numbered about 2.6 million . and in that same year , it was over .
the government - amid the oil crisis and troubled economy - stopped the program .
for italians , it did n't matter . since the 1960s , italians could work in germany because of their membership in the european economic community .
still , a majority of italians - about 90 percent - returned to italy .
it was the same with the spanish and portuguese workers . today , about 7 million foreigners live in germany , the majority from turkey . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking back at german-italian relations a new exhibition in germany takes a nostalgic look at the two-way surge of italian migrant workers to germany in the 1950s and sun-starved germans to bella italia in an era that came before the current transalpine rift .

in december , they mushroom , and in the days before christmas they are unavoidable , advertising gospel choirs , shows , church concerts and sing-alongs . it may seem peculiar that gospel music would find such a warm welcome in germany , a country with one of the lowest rates of church-goers in europe , and without a history of spiritual singing of its own .
but , the numbers are clear : the gospel internet site berlin-gospel-web.de lists 50 gospel choirs in the berlin area alone ; gospelszene.de claims 500 choirs nationwide -lrb- although arjan leuscnhner , a gospel aficionado who helps run the site , estimates there are five times that many . -rrb-

how did the country of bach , beethoven and wagner become enthralled by queen esther marrow , mahalia jackson and the harlem gospel singers ?
music historians say it was part of the general wave of interest in black music that came about after world war ii , helped along by movies like " the blues brothers " and " sister act . "
for the past decade , gospel singers and choir directors - many of whom are americans working in the country - have been hard pressed to keep up with the insatiable demand for concerts and workshops dedicated to black spiritual music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can good singing give the church a boost ?
adrienne morgan hammond has made a career of gospel , though she came to germany as a musical actress and jazz singer .
today she leads three permanent gospel choirs in the cologne area , and holds 20 workshops a year in churches around the country .
" there is a huge following for gospel music ; i 've never performed for less than 400 people , " said morgan hammond , a california native who grew up singing gospel in her church choir .
" i was pretty amazed germans liked this music .
its not really about their culture at all , but i think that has something to do with it .
they 're not allowed to show emotions , and gospel is attractive because they can be emotional in public .
and they can show their belief in god in a completely different way than they are used to . "
let the music speak gospelszene 's leuschner noted : " many young germans find it embarrasing to say , ' i believe in god , ' but they can do it through the music , especially since they are singing it in english . "
one of the pioneers in germany 's gospel scene is angelika rehaag ; she runs a ' gospel academy ' near düssledorf , set up a gospel music festival 10 years ago , and leads seven gospel choirs herself .
she says the traditional church - in germany that means either lutheran or catholic - has left a gap that gospel music has jumped in to fill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional german worship is more of a " sit down and be quiet " affair " people are n't finding a home in the church , it 's too philosophical and theological .
it 's nothing for the heart .
but gospel music is for the heart , " she said .
historical basis according to rehaag , after world war ii , everyday germans were forced to reject their traditional songs , which had been taken over during the war and turned into pro-nazi propaganda .
" after the war , singing stopped in schools and kindergartens .
choirs these days are filled by completely old people , or there are children 's choirs .
but for people between 30 to 50 , there is a huge need , " she said .
rehaag sees gospel as the church 's next best chance to appeal to a younger public .
" a lot of church youth choirs have taken to calling themselves gospel choirs , whether or not they really sing gospel ; maybe they are just singing spirituals .
people come who would avoid the church , but gospel sounds interesting . "
changes to the church ?
ansgar puff , a priest at the st. josef catholic church in düsseldorf , where rehaag leads a gospel choir , sees the matter a little more skeptically .
gospel singing may help bring people closer to religion , but so far there 's no evidence it is swelling the rolls of the faithful .
" often people start singing gospel and they do n't even understand what they are saying .
then at some point they have to come to terms with the words of the text , so that is fruitful , and it leads them to think about their faith .
but the next step would be to join the church , and i have n't seen them do that yet , " he said .
a case in point could be christiane ehlert , a 42-year-old occupational therapist who broke with the church long ago , but who has been singing gospel with morgan hammond for the past two years .
" i do n't necessarily connect my love of this music with the love of the church , " she said .
" it certainly feels good , like medicine .
but it does n't have to be about the love of god . "
on a mission in germany morgan hammond seems to feel the music speaks for itself . " i try not to hammer religion into the heads of these people .
but every other song we sing has the word god in it , " she said .
" i do n't have to stand up and preach it .
people who do n't believe are still touched somehow . "
she added : " in my youth i wanted to be a missionary .
now i call myself a missionary in germany .
i 'm trying to help revolutionize the church and get people back in who got tired of having to be completely quiet in church , of having to suffer .

the heritage lottery fund has pledged the funding for the picture palace project at newcastle 's tyneside cinema .
it is the last surviving purpose-built newsreel cinema in the uk still operating as a cinema .
the money will be used to return the former news theatre to the way it looked in its 1930s heyday and enable it to screen archive newsreels .
tuesday 's announcement means the cinema can now go on to the next stage of securing funding and will now submit a further , fully developed application .
unique heritage cinema chief executive mark dobson said : " the tyneside cinema has a special place in the lives of so many people , both in the region and beyond .
" we are thrilled that we will be able to restore this unique piece of british heritage and at the same time expand and extend the building so that we can engage ever more people with independent film from across the world . "
the cinema was built in 1937 and designed by local architect george bell and commissioned by local film entrepreneur dixon scott .
the restoration and education programme funded by the heritage lottery fund will be complemented by an extension to the building to give budding film-makers the chance to use the building .
the northern rock foundation has also announced a grant of £ 500,000 towards the redevelopment of the cinema .

electricity for about 800 homes will be provided by a turbine to be built as part of a five-year pilot project .
the turbine , powered by the currents at strangford narrows , will be connected to the national grid next autumn .
energy minister angela smith said the scheme , which has been given a £ 4.5m government grant , would " minimise the impacts of energy generation " .
bristol-based company marine current turbines has been licensed to install the single steel tower-like " monopile " which will support two 16-metre rotor blades placed three metres below the sea surface .
an electricity cable will run from the turbine to a land-based sub-station via a directionally drilled hole .
ms smith said the initiative provided " a unique opportunity to investigate the potential to generate significant amounts of clean , renewable electricity " .
" tidal turbine technology is one of the key renewable technologies that will help the uk achieve the carbon dioxide emission reduction targets and is a clean , sustainable replacement for ever more expensive fossil fuels , " she said .
" this project fits closely with government 's commitment to take action now to support the development and use of renewable forms of energy . "
martin wright , managing director of marine current turbines , said strangford lough had one of the strongest tidal currents in the british isles and was therefore " a perfect location for us to test a pre-commercial device " .
however , environmental watchdog , the joint marine partnership , said any " negative impact " caused by the project on the lough 's wildlife would " be unacceptable " .
spokesperson kate hutchinson described the narrows as " a highly sensitive environment " which supported " internationally-important wildlife " .
" as this is a new technology , we do not know its full environmental impacts , for example on large marine animals like seals and cetaceans , and seabed species and habitats located downstream of the proposal in the lough , " she said .
" in principle , the joint marine partnership strongly supports the development of marine renewable technologies , to combat the effects of climate change , but these must be sited appropriately . "

failure to do so will almost certainly result in exxon losing its oil field concessions in the country .
venezuela 's socialist government has now signed new agreements with almost all foreign petroleum companies .
after months of pressure from left- wing leader hugo chavez most foreign oil firms working there have caved in .
they have agreed to hand over a controlling stake of their oil interests to the venezuelan state .
this means that venezuela now calls the shots in what the foreign guests can and can not do .
in addition , the companies which have signed the new contracts - such as chevron , bp , shell and total - will in future be presented with much higher tax bills by the government .
foreign unease but venezuela says it is only fair that the foreigners are made to pay up as they have got away lightly in the past .
much of the oil revenue in venezuela goes into social projects in shanty towns and poor rural areas .
but the us oil giant , exxonmobil , is digging in its heels and is so far refusing to agree to the terms of the new deal .
exxon risks losing venezuelan operations if it fails to comply .
there is growing unease among foreign energy companies based latin america that they may be forced to become junior partners by a string of left wing governments .
in the case of bolivia and the apparent shift to the left there following elections on sunday , it is possible that the new government will decide to follow venezuela 's example and renegotiate oil and gas contracts with foreign investors .

according to a state report on tuesday , china 's economy was 16.8 % larger in 2004 than initially calculated .
that puts china into sixth place in terms of economic size , ahead of italy and close behind the uk and france .
if current growth continues , china could squeeze into fourth position by the end of 2005 , economists believe .
as it gets larger , china is going to have to deal with both political and economic implications , analysts said .
' long tradition ' beijing is already under pressure to allow its currency to strengthen , with nations including the us arguing that it is keeping the yuan undervalued in order to boost exports .
as its economy becomes bigger and more robust , critics are likely to argue that it can better withstand a more freely traded currency . "
some sceptical economists point out that china has a long tradition of massaging statistics " louisa lim , bbc beijing china also is catching up on asia 's biggest economy , japan , and there are likely to be political concerns as it becomes a more important and dominant force in the region , analysts say .
however , louisa lim , the bbc 's correspondent in beijing , urged caution when dealing with data compiled by the chinese government .
" some sceptical economists point out that china has a long tradition of massaging statistics for political motives , " she said .
even so , she pointed out that the world bank had welcomed the new figures as a major improvement .
" it 's not uncommon for countries with dynamic economies to under-represent rapidly growing enterprises , " she said .
' healthy ' tuesday 's figures were issued by the national bureau of statistics following a survey that aimed to gather more accurate data .
according to the report , china 's economy was 2,300bn yuan -lrb- $ 283bn -rrb- bigger than previous figures had shown .
the new research raised the estimate of china 's economic output in 2004 to nearly 16 trillion yuan .
service industries accounted for 93 % of the revision , the bureau said - a reflection of how the sector is playing an ever more important role in china 's economy .
" the revised statistics show that china 's economic structure is more reasonable and healthy than the previous figures showed , " li deshui , the head of the national bureau of statistics , told a news conference .
economists have long said that china 's official annual growth figure of 9 % understates the size of its economy .
inside and out china has recently been benefiting from strong exports and improving domestic demand .
the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said last month that domestic demand would improve between 2006 and 2007 , and that china would increase its share of global trade .
the oecd expects the chinese economy to grow by 9.3 % in 2005 , rising to 9.4 % next year and 9.5 % in 2007 .
despite the sharp upward revision of its gdp , economic output per person is still quite low .
" we still have a long way to go to catch up with the developed countries , " mr li said .
