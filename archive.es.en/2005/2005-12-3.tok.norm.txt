" our net payments must fall , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
it was not possible " one day to urge germany to respect the maastricht criteria " while " already the next day it is not being ruled out in europe that germany should strengthen its position as a net contributor , " he said . steinbrück is a member of the germany 's social democratic party , which forms a grand coalition government with the conservative christian union parties led by chancellor angela merkel . since 2002 germany has been in breach of the maastricht criteria , encoded in the eu stability and growth pact , which lay down among other requirements that a nation 's budget deficit should not exceed three percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück previously served as premier of north rhine-westphalia on monday steinbrück will make his debut as finance minister at a meeting of eu economy and finance ministers in brussels . " there exist in germany some special factors , which we need to explain to partner countries , " he told the newspaper . these included the reunification of west and east germany after 1990 and the reforms launched in 2003 by then chancellor gerhard schröder in the context of the agenda 2010 project . germany and sweden are the two biggest net contributors to the eu budget . eu budget deal impossible ? britain meanwhile warned on saturday that it may not be able to secure a long sought-after deal on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget at the bloc 's next summit in just under two weeks . the government in london , which holds the eu presidency until dec .
31 , is due to submit its first concrete proposals on resolving the budget impasse to its counterparts on monday . " i think probably by the end of next week we will have a clearer idea of whether a deal can actually be done , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , told bbc radio .
" if a deal was not done then i think it would be greatly to our disadvantage , but that may be where we end up .
we are not prepared to sign any deal .
we want to try and get the right deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will british prime minister tony blair find backers for his proposals ?
britain 's offer will be studied by eu foreign ministers at a specially called " conclave " on wednesday in hopes that a deal can be inked by the bloc 's leaders at their summit in brussels on dec .
15-16 . britain has warned that it wants substantial changes made to the previous budget plan , tabled by the luxembourg presidency in june and which was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . leaked details of monday 's offer suggest prime minister tony blair will propose cutting funds to the newcomer states in central and eastern europe . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , last week urged blair not to take from the poor to give to the rich . britai n ready to budge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants to keep its agricultural subsidies the deal is blocked on two key issues : britain 's refusal to surrender its substantial budget rebate , and french resistance to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is a major beneficiary as the biggest agricultural producer in the union . alexander hinted that britain could be prepared to reduce its rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for cutting its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies . " we were clear at the start of our presidency , that we did recognize it was fair for each of us to make contribution towards those costs of enlargement in these poorer countries that have come into the eu , " he said . the rebate averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 , but critics say britain 's economic position has greatly improved since it was first granted . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

it 's a reputation the nation is not keen to have . a recently published report on the state of drug-taking across the european union revealed the czech republic to have overtaken the netherlands in soft drug consumption , but also showed a blurring of the lines between the use of cannabis and harder narcotics . when asked whether they had consumed hashish or cannabis in the past year , more than 20 percent of czechs between the ages of 15 and 34 confirmed that they had . " usage is very widespread , " one school child said .
" for some people it leads to the use of harder drugs , but for most people it does n't cause any great damage . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a firm favorite in the czech republic another pupil said she believes that although everyone she knows who smokes pot is aware of the dangers , nobody has the feeling that they 're not doing anything out of the ordinary or that anything bad will happen to them . drugs versus drinking ivan douda , a psychologist who founded a drop-in center for drug users in prague fifteen years ago , said the high consumption of alcohol among czechs has a lot to do with the rise in drug use . " we have quite a high level of drinking here , and young people seem to be reacting by saying ' you have your alcohol , let us have our soft drugs , " ' he said .
" they genuinely compare one with the other in terms of risks . " he pointed out the irrelevance of having smoked dope in order to become a hard drug user , adding that most of those who end up with an addiction would have gotten there anyhow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocks of hash douda also said that youngsters who enjoy smoking a joint every now and then are most likely to be doing it as a reaction to their parents .
he said they perceive their elders to have had bad experiences , and take it as a warning to do things differently . falling morals are " biggest problem " while the czech republic is now taking part in a europe-wide campaign to treat addicts and reduce the accessibility to drugs , douda said it is important for the czech government to show greater tolerance towards soft drugs , thus preventing young users from having to break the law . " the fact that young people have to break a law , which they consider wrong , leads to falling moral standards , " he said .
" those risks are greater than ones posed by the use of hashish or marijuana .

" it goes without saying that the world cup is a great opportunity to make money , " said katharina cetin , an official at the hydra prostitute advice center in berlin .
" we expect some great revenues .
it 'll be good business . " but there are fears that many of the women who end up working in the sex trade at the 2006 world cup will have been coerced into prostitution or duped by criminal gangs . solwodi , an organization that comes to the aid of women in difficulty , said that many of the illegal prostitutes would come into the country recruited under false pretences , attracted by offers of jobs as baby-sitters , bar workers or waitresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women have been forced to work the streets by gangsters " we do n't know exactly how many women could be forced into prostituting themselves , " said brunhilde raiser , head of the national council of women in germany that has launched a campaign dubbed " red card to forced prostitution . " " but what is sure is that prostitution will increase enormously , " raiser said . german soccer team asked for its support to ramp up public support for its red card campaign , the national council of women has asked players from the german national football team to take part . " as a member of the german national team , you are a model for many men in this country and you know that your choice often counts for more than that of politicians , " the council said in its letter to goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" say to those that think themselves ' real men ' that ' real men ' are rightly against trade in women and forced prostitution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has been the only german squad member to support the campaign kahn 's main rival for the starting goalkeeper 's position , jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , has been the only one to reply so far , the council admitted . " he said he would speak to his colleagues , " raiser said . " we have n't heard anything from him since and all the others are silent . " as for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said in a letter to the former minister for families , renate schmidt , that neither the dfb nor the world cup organizing committee wanted to be " active " in the campaign . " we receive demands for support every day , " mayer-vorfelder said . businesses looking to capitalize on prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany legalized prostitution in designated areas in 2001 but while concerns remain over the unwanted influx , entrepreneurs are working hard to capitalize on the business of sex in a country where prostitution was legalized in 2001 - but only in designated areas . cologne and dortmund , two of the host cities for the world cup , have even erected a number of wooden " sex huts " for the football showpiece with condoms and showers at hand .
the idea is to keep the prostitutes and their clients away from public places .
berlin is considering following suit . " it is better than having the couples in public areas , " said dirk lamprecht , a member of the administrative council in berlin . in berlin itself , a five-million-euro brothel has just opened in 3,000 square meters of a refurbished warehouse just three train stops from the main world cup venue , the olympic stadium . the four-story building will accommodate up to 100 prostitutes and 650 male clients . its owners will demand that its sex workers provide their tax number and proof of permission to work in the european union . " we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " norman jacob , a lawyer for the brothel operators , said of the world cup .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening .
business will be booming .

" i believe that relations are very good and i have the strong impression that the polish president-elect is also interested in very good relations with germany and in the forward-looking positions that we can adopt together , " merkel said after talks with lech kaczynski . but the chancellor , accompanied on the visit by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , acknowledged problems would have to be discussed , " notably , of course , the baltic sea pipeline . " we would like this project to be accessible to everyone and we will set up a joint working group to deal with it , " she said .

" our net payments must fall , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
it was not possible " one day to urge germany to respect the maastricht criteria " while " already the next day it is not being ruled out in europe that germany should strengthen its position as a net contributor , " he said . steinbrück is a member of the germany 's social democratic party , which forms a grand coalition government with the conservative christian union parties led by chancellor angela merkel . since 2002 germany has been in breach of the maastricht criteria , encoded in the eu stability and growth pact , which lay down among other requirements that a nation 's budget deficit should not exceed three percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück previously served as premier of north rhine-westphalia on monday steinbrück will make his debut as finance minister at a meeting of eu economy and finance ministers in brussels . " there exist in germany some special factors , which we need to explain to partner countries , " he told the newspaper . these included the reunification of west and east germany after 1990 and the reforms launched in 2003 by then chancellor gerhard schröder in the context of the agenda 2010 project . germany and sweden are the two biggest net contributors to the eu budget . eu budget deal impossible ? britain meanwhile warned on saturday that it may not be able to secure a long sought-after deal on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget at the bloc 's next summit in just under two weeks . the government in london , which holds the eu presidency until dec .
31 , is due to submit its first concrete proposals on resolving the budget impasse to its counterparts on monday . " i think probably by the end of next week we will have a clearer idea of whether a deal can actually be done , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , told bbc radio .
" if a deal was not done then i think it would be greatly to our disadvantage , but that may be where we end up .
we are not prepared to sign any deal .
we want to try and get the right deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will british prime minister tony blair find backers for his proposals ?
britain 's offer will be studied by eu foreign ministers at a specially called " conclave " on wednesday in hopes that a deal can be inked by the bloc 's leaders at their summit in brussels on dec .
15-16 . britain has warned that it wants substantial changes made to the previous budget plan , tabled by the luxembourg presidency in june and which was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . leaked details of monday 's offer suggest prime minister tony blair will propose cutting funds to the newcomer states in central and eastern europe . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , last week urged blair not to take from the poor to give to the rich . britai n ready to budge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants to keep its agricultural subsidies the deal is blocked on two key issues : britain 's refusal to surrender its substantial budget rebate , and french resistance to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is a major beneficiary as the biggest agricultural producer in the union . alexander hinted that britain could be prepared to reduce its rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for cutting its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies . " we were clear at the start of our presidency , that we did recognize it was fair for each of us to make contribution towards those costs of enlargement in these poorer countries that have come into the eu , " he said . the rebate averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 , but critics say britain 's economic position has greatly improved since it was first granted . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

it 's a reputation the nation is not keen to have . a recently published report on the state of drug-taking across the european union revealed the czech republic to have overtaken the netherlands in soft drug consumption , but also showed a blurring of the lines between the use of cannabis and harder narcotics . when asked whether they had consumed hashish or cannabis in the past year , more than 20 percent of czechs between the ages of 15 and 34 confirmed that they had . " usage is very widespread , " one school child said .
" for some people it leads to the use of harder drugs , but for most people it does n't cause any great damage . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a firm favorite in the czech republic another pupil said she believes that although everyone she knows who smokes pot is aware of the dangers , nobody has the feeling that they 're not doing anything out of the ordinary or that anything bad will happen to them . drugs versus drinking ivan douda , a psychologist who founded a drop-in center for drug users in prague fifteen years ago , said the high consumption of alcohol among czechs has a lot to do with the rise in drug use . " we have quite a high level of drinking here , and young people seem to be reacting by saying ' you have your alcohol , let us have our soft drugs , " ' he said .
" they genuinely compare one with the other in terms of risks . " he pointed out the irrelevance of having smoked dope in order to become a hard drug user , adding that most of those who end up with an addiction would have gotten there anyhow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocks of hash douda also said that youngsters who enjoy smoking a joint every now and then are most likely to be doing it as a reaction to their parents .
he said they perceive their elders to have had bad experiences , and take it as a warning to do things differently . falling morals are " biggest problem " while the czech republic is now taking part in a europe-wide campaign to treat addicts and reduce the accessibility to drugs , douda said it is important for the czech government to show greater tolerance towards soft drugs , thus preventing young users from having to break the law . " the fact that young people have to break a law , which they consider wrong , leads to falling moral standards , " he said .

" it goes without saying that the world cup is a great opportunity to make money , " said katharina cetin , an official at the hydra prostitute advice center in berlin .
" we expect some great revenues .
it 'll be good business . " but there are fears that many of the women who end up working in the sex trade at the 2006 world cup will have been coerced into prostitution or duped by criminal gangs . solwodi , an organization that comes to the aid of women in difficulty , said that many of the illegal prostitutes would come into the country recruited under false pretences , attracted by offers of jobs as baby-sitters , bar workers or waitresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women have been forced to work the streets by gangsters " we do n't know exactly how many women could be forced into prostituting themselves , " said brunhilde raiser , head of the national council of women in germany that has launched a campaign dubbed " red card to forced prostitution . " " but what is sure is that prostitution will increase enormously , " raiser said . german soccer team asked for its support to ramp up public support for its red card campaign , the national council of women has asked players from the german national football team to take part . " as a member of the german national team , you are a model for many men in this country and you know that your choice often counts for more than that of politicians , " the council said in its letter to goalkeeper oliver kahn .

" he said he would speak to his colleagues , " raiser said . " we have n't heard anything from him since and all the others are silent . " as for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said in a letter to the former minister for families , renate schmidt , that neither the dfb nor the world cup organizing committee wanted to be " active " in the campaign . " we receive demands for support every day , " mayer-vorfelder said . businesses looking to capitalize on prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany legalized prostitution in designated areas in 2001 but while concerns remain over the unwanted influx , entrepreneurs are working hard to capitalize on the business of sex in a country where prostitution was legalized in 2001 - but only in designated areas . cologne and dortmund , two of the host cities for the world cup , have even erected a number of wooden " sex huts " for the football showpiece with condoms and showers at hand .
the idea is to keep the prostitutes and their clients away from public places .
berlin is considering following suit . " it is better than having the couples in public areas , " said dirk lamprecht , a member of the administrative council in berlin . in berlin itself , a five-million-euro brothel has just opened in 3,000 square meters of a refurbished warehouse just three train stops from the main world cup venue , the olympic stadium . the four-story building will accommodate up to 100 prostitutes and 650 male clients . its owners will demand that its sex workers provide their tax number and proof of permission to work in the european union . " we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " norman jacob , a lawyer for the brothel operators , said of the world cup .

" our net payments must fall , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
it was not possible " one day to urge germany to respect the maastricht criteria " while " already the next day it is not being ruled out in europe that germany should strengthen its position as a net contributor , " he said . steinbrück is a member of the germany 's social democratic party , which forms a grand coalition government with the conservative christian union parties led by chancellor angela merkel . since 2002 germany has been in breach of the maastricht criteria , encoded in the eu stability and growth pact , which lay down among other requirements that a nation 's budget deficit should not exceed three percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück previously served as premier of north rhine-westphalia on monday steinbrück will make his debut as finance minister at a meeting of eu economy and finance ministers in brussels . " there exist in germany some special factors , which we need to explain to partner countries , " he told the newspaper . these included the reunification of west and east germany after 1990 and the reforms launched in 2003 by then chancellor gerhard schröder in the context of the agenda 2010 project . germany and sweden are the two biggest net contributors to the eu budget . eu budget deal impossible ? britain meanwhile warned on saturday that it may not be able to secure a long sought-after deal on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget at the bloc 's next summit in just under two weeks . the government in london , which holds the eu presidency until dec .
31 , is due to submit its first concrete proposals on resolving the budget impasse to its counterparts on monday . " i think probably by the end of next week we will have a clearer idea of whether a deal can actually be done , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , told bbc radio .
" if a deal was not done then i think it would be greatly to our disadvantage , but that may be where we end up .
we are not prepared to sign any deal .

" we were clear at the start of our presidency , that we did recognize it was fair for each of us to make contribution towards those costs of enlargement in these poorer countries that have come into the eu , " he said . the rebate averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 , but critics say britain 's economic position has greatly improved since it was first granted . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

" it goes without saying that the world cup is a great opportunity to make money , " said katharina cetin , an official at the hydra prostitute advice center in berlin .
" we expect some great revenues .
it 'll be good business . " but there are fears that many of the women who end up working in the sex trade at the 2006 world cup will have been coerced into prostitution or duped by criminal gangs . solwodi , an organization that comes to the aid of women in difficulty , said that many of the illegal prostitutes would come into the country recruited under false pretences , attracted by offers of jobs as baby-sitters , bar workers or waitresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women have been forced to work the streets by gangsters " we do n't know exactly how many women could be forced into prostituting themselves , " said brunhilde raiser , head of the national council of women in germany that has launched a campaign dubbed " red card to forced prostitution . " " but what is sure is that prostitution will increase enormously , " raiser said . german soccer team asked for its support to ramp up public support for its red card campaign , the national council of women has asked players from the german national football team to take part . " as a member of the german national team , you are a model for many men in this country and you know that your choice often counts for more than that of politicians , " the council said in its letter to goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" say to those that think themselves ' real men ' that ' real men ' are rightly against trade in women and forced prostitution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has been the only german squad member to support the campaign kahn 's main rival for the starting goalkeeper 's position , jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , has been the only one to reply so far , the council admitted . " he said he would speak to his colleagues , " raiser said . " we have n't heard anything from him since and all the others are silent . " as for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said in a letter to the former minister for families , renate schmidt , that neither the dfb nor the world cup organizing committee wanted to be " active " in the campaign . " we receive demands for support every day , " mayer-vorfelder said . businesses looking to capitalize on prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany legalized prostitution in designated areas in 2001 but while concerns remain over the unwanted influx , entrepreneurs are working hard to capitalize on the business of sex in a country where prostitution was legalized in 2001 - but only in designated areas . cologne and dortmund , two of the host cities for the world cup , have even erected a number of wooden " sex huts " for the football showpiece with condoms and showers at hand .
the idea is to keep the prostitutes and their clients away from public places .
berlin is considering following suit . " it is better than having the couples in public areas , " said dirk lamprecht , a member of the administrative council in berlin . in berlin itself , a five-million-euro brothel has just opened in 3,000 square meters of a refurbished warehouse just three train stops from the main world cup venue , the olympic stadium . the four-story building will accommodate up to 100 prostitutes and 650 male clients . its owners will demand that its sex workers provide their tax number and proof of permission to work in the european union . " we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " norman jacob , a lawyer for the brothel operators , said of the world cup .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening .
business will be booming .
football and sex belong together , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

" our net payments must fall , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
it was not possible " one day to urge germany to respect the maastricht criteria " while " already the next day it is not being ruled out in europe that germany should strengthen its position as a net contributor , " he said . steinbrück is a member of the germany 's social democratic party , which forms a grand coalition government with the conservative christian union parties led by chancellor angela merkel . since 2002 germany has been in breach of the maastricht criteria , encoded in the eu stability and growth pact , which lay down among other requirements that a nation 's budget deficit should not exceed three percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück previously served as premier of north rhine-westphalia on monday steinbrück will make his debut as finance minister at a meeting of eu economy and finance ministers in brussels . " there exist in germany some special factors , which we need to explain to partner countries , " he told the newspaper . these included the reunification of west and east germany after 1990 and the reforms launched in 2003 by then chancellor gerhard schröder in the context of the agenda 2010 project . germany and sweden are the two biggest net contributors to the eu budget . eu budget deal impossible ? britain meanwhile warned on saturday that it may not be able to secure a long sought-after deal on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget at the bloc 's next summit in just under two weeks . the government in london , which holds the eu presidency until dec .
31 , is due to submit its first concrete proposals on resolving the budget impasse to its counterparts on monday . " i think probably by the end of next week we will have a clearer idea of whether a deal can actually be done , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , told bbc radio .
" if a deal was not done then i think it would be greatly to our disadvantage , but that may be where we end up .
we are not prepared to sign any deal .
we want to try and get the right deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will british prime minister tony blair find backers for his proposals ?
britain 's offer will be studied by eu foreign ministers at a specially called " conclave " on wednesday in hopes that a deal can be inked by the bloc 's leaders at their summit in brussels on dec .
15-16 . britain has warned that it wants substantial changes made to the previous budget plan , tabled by the luxembourg presidency in june and which was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . leaked details of monday 's offer suggest prime minister tony blair will propose cutting funds to the newcomer states in central and eastern europe . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , last week urged blair not to take from the poor to give to the rich . britai n ready to budge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants to keep its agricultural subsidies the deal is blocked on two key issues : britain 's refusal to surrender its substantial budget rebate , and french resistance to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is a major beneficiary as the biggest agricultural producer in the union . alexander hinted that britain could be prepared to reduce its rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for cutting its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies . " we were clear at the start of our presidency , that we did recognize it was fair for each of us to make contribution towards those costs of enlargement in these poorer countries that have come into the eu , " he said . the rebate averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 , but critics say britain 's economic position has greatly improved since it was first granted . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

" i believe that relations are very good and i have the strong impression that the polish president-elect is also interested in very good relations with germany and in the forward-looking positions that we can adopt together , " merkel said after talks with lech kaczynski . but the chancellor , accompanied on the visit by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , acknowledged problems would have to be discussed , " notably , of course , the baltic sea pipeline . " we would like this project to be accessible to everyone and we will set up a joint working group to deal with it , " she said .
" i made it very clear , of course , that we want to have good strategic relations with russia - not over the head of poland , but in consultation with poland .
we wish to avoid friction , but to have good relations with both russia and poland .

" it goes without saying that the world cup is a great opportunity to make money , " said katharina cetin , an official at the hydra prostitute advice center in berlin .
" we expect some great revenues .
it 'll be good business . " but there are fears that many of the women who end up working in the sex trade at the 2006 world cup will have been coerced into prostitution or duped by criminal gangs . solwodi , an organization that comes to the aid of women in difficulty , said that many of the illegal prostitutes would come into the country recruited under false pretences , attracted by offers of jobs as baby-sitters , bar workers or waitresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women have been forced to work the streets by gangsters " we do n't know exactly how many women could be forced into prostituting themselves , " said brunhilde raiser , head of the national council of women in germany that has launched a campaign dubbed " red card to forced prostitution . " " but what is sure is that prostitution will increase enormously , " raiser said . german soccer team asked for its support to ramp up public support for its red card campaign , the national council of women has asked players from the german national football team to take part . " as a member of the german national team , you are a model for many men in this country and you know that your choice often counts for more than that of politicians , " the council said in its letter to goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" say to those that think themselves ' real men ' that ' real men ' are rightly against trade in women and forced prostitution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has been the only german squad member to support the campaign kahn 's main rival for the starting goalkeeper 's position , jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , has been the only one to reply so far , the council admitted . " he said he would speak to his colleagues , " raiser said . " we have n't heard anything from him since and all the others are silent . " as for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said in a letter to the former minister for families , renate schmidt , that neither the dfb nor the world cup organizing committee wanted to be " active " in the campaign . " we receive demands for support every day , " mayer-vorfelder said . businesses looking to capitalize on prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany legalized prostitution in designated areas in 2001 but while concerns remain over the unwanted influx , entrepreneurs are working hard to capitalize on the business of sex in a country where prostitution was legalized in 2001 - but only in designated areas . cologne and dortmund , two of the host cities for the world cup , have even erected a number of wooden " sex huts " for the football showpiece with condoms and showers at hand .
the idea is to keep the prostitutes and their clients away from public places .
berlin is considering following suit . " it is better than having the couples in public areas , " said dirk lamprecht , a member of the administrative council in berlin . in berlin itself , a five-million-euro brothel has just opened in 3,000 square meters of a refurbished warehouse just three train stops from the main world cup venue , the olympic stadium . the four-story building will accommodate up to 100 prostitutes and 650 male clients . its owners will demand that its sex workers provide their tax number and proof of permission to work in the european union . " we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " norman jacob , a lawyer for the brothel operators , said of the world cup .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening .
business will be booming .
football and sex belong together , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

" it goes without saying that the world cup is a great opportunity to make money , " said katharina cetin , an official at the hydra prostitute advice center in berlin .
" we expect some great revenues .
it 'll be good business . " but there are fears that many of the women who end up working in the sex trade at the 2006 world cup will have been coerced into prostitution or duped by criminal gangs . solwodi , an organization that comes to the aid of women in difficulty , said that many of the illegal prostitutes would come into the country recruited under false pretences , attracted by offers of jobs as baby-sitters , bar workers or waitresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women have been forced to work the streets by gangsters " we do n't know exactly how many women could be forced into prostituting themselves , " said brunhilde raiser , head of the national council of women in germany that has launched a campaign dubbed " red card to forced prostitution . " " but what is sure is that prostitution will increase enormously , " raiser said . german soccer team asked for its support to ramp up public support for its red card campaign , the national council of women has asked players from the german national football team to take part . " as a member of the german national team , you are a model for many men in this country and you know that your choice often counts for more than that of politicians , " the council said in its letter to goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" say to those that think themselves ' real men ' that ' real men ' are rightly against trade in women and forced prostitution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has been the only german squad member to support the campaign kahn 's main rival for the starting goalkeeper 's position , jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , has been the only one to reply so far , the council admitted . " he said he would speak to his colleagues , " raiser said . " we have n't heard anything from him since and all the others are silent . " as for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said in a letter to the former minister for families , renate schmidt , that neither the dfb nor the world cup organizing committee wanted to be " active " in the campaign . " we receive demands for support every day , " mayer-vorfelder said . businesses looking to capitalize on prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany legalized prostitution in designated areas in 2001 but while concerns remain over the unwanted influx , entrepreneurs are working hard to capitalize on the business of sex in a country where prostitution was legalized in 2001 - but only in designated areas . cologne and dortmund , two of the host cities for the world cup , have even erected a number of wooden " sex huts " for the football showpiece with condoms and showers at hand .
the idea is to keep the prostitutes and their clients away from public places .
berlin is considering following suit . " it is better than having the couples in public areas , " said dirk lamprecht , a member of the administrative council in berlin . in berlin itself , a five-million-euro brothel has just opened in 3,000 square meters of a refurbished warehouse just three train stops from the main world cup venue , the olympic stadium . the four-story building will accommodate up to 100 prostitutes and 650 male clients . its owners will demand that its sex workers provide their tax number and proof of permission to work in the european union . " we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " norman jacob , a lawyer for the brothel operators , said of the world cup .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening .
business will be booming .

" it goes without saying that the world cup is a great opportunity to make money , " said katharina cetin , an official at the hydra prostitute advice center in berlin .
" we expect some great revenues .
it 'll be good business . " but there are fears that many of the women who end up working in the sex trade at the 2006 world cup will have been coerced into prostitution or duped by criminal gangs . solwodi , an organization that comes to the aid of women in difficulty , said that many of the illegal prostitutes would come into the country recruited under false pretences , attracted by offers of jobs as baby-sitters , bar workers or waitresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women have been forced to work the streets by gangsters " we do n't know exactly how many women could be forced into prostituting themselves , " said brunhilde raiser , head of the national council of women in germany that has launched a campaign dubbed " red card to forced prostitution .

" as a member of the german national team , you are a model for many men in this country and you know that your choice often counts for more than that of politicians , " the council said in its letter to goalkeeper oliver kahn .

" as for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said in a letter to the former minister for families , renate schmidt , that neither the dfb nor the world cup organizing committee wanted to be " active " in the campaign .

the idea is to keep the prostitutes and their clients away from public places .
berlin is considering following suit . " it is better than having the couples in public areas , " said dirk lamprecht , a member of the administrative council in berlin . in berlin itself , a five-million-euro brothel has just opened in 3,000 square meters of a refurbished warehouse just three train stops from the main world cup venue , the olympic stadium . the four-story building will accommodate up to 100 prostitutes and 650 male clients . its owners will demand that its sex workers provide their tax number and proof of permission to work in the european union .

it 's a reputation the nation is not keen to have . a recently published report on the state of drug-taking across the european union revealed the czech republic to have overtaken the netherlands in soft drug consumption , but also showed a blurring of the lines between the use of cannabis and harder narcotics . when asked whether they had consumed hashish or cannabis in the past year , more than 20 percent of czechs between the ages of 15 and 34 confirmed that they had . " usage is very widespread , " one school child said .
" for some people it leads to the use of harder drugs , but for most people it does n't cause any great damage .

" we have quite a high level of drinking here , and young people seem to be reacting by saying ' you have your alcohol , let us have our soft drugs , " ' he said .
" they genuinely compare one with the other in terms of risks . " he pointed out the irrelevance of having smoked dope in order to become a hard drug user , adding that most of those who end up with an addiction would have gotten there anyhow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocks of hash douda also said that youngsters who enjoy smoking a joint every now and then are most likely to be doing it as a reaction to their parents .
he said they perceive their elders to have had bad experiences , and take it as a warning to do things differently . falling morals are " biggest problem " while the czech republic is now taking part in a europe-wide campaign to treat addicts and reduce the accessibility to drugs , douda said it is important for the czech government to show greater tolerance towards soft drugs , thus preventing young users from having to break the law . " the fact that young people have to break a law , which they consider wrong , leads to falling moral standards , " he said .

" our net payments must fall , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
it was not possible " one day to urge germany to respect the maastricht criteria " while " already the next day it is not being ruled out in europe that germany should strengthen its position as a net contributor , " he said . steinbrück is a member of the germany 's social democratic party , which forms a grand coalition government with the conservative christian union parties led by chancellor angela merkel . since 2002 germany has been in breach of the maastricht criteria , encoded in the eu stability and growth pact , which lay down among other requirements that a nation 's budget deficit should not exceed three percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück previously served as premier of north rhine-westphalia on monday steinbrück will make his debut as finance minister at a meeting of eu economy and finance ministers in brussels . " there exist in germany some special factors , which we need to explain to partner countries , " he told the newspaper . these included the reunification of west and east germany after 1990 and the reforms launched in 2003 by then chancellor gerhard schröder in the context of the agenda 2010 project . germany and sweden are the two biggest net contributors to the eu budget . eu budget deal impossible ? britain meanwhile warned on saturday that it may not be able to secure a long sought-after deal on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget at the bloc 's next summit in just under two weeks . the government in london , which holds the eu presidency until dec .
31 , is due to submit its first concrete proposals on resolving the budget impasse to its counterparts on monday . " i think probably by the end of next week we will have a clearer idea of whether a deal can actually be done , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , told bbc radio .
" if a deal was not done then i think it would be greatly to our disadvantage , but that may be where we end up .
we are not prepared to sign any deal .
we want to try and get the right deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will british prime minister tony blair find backers for his proposals ?

" it goes without saying that the world cup is a great opportunity to make money , " said katharina cetin , an official at the hydra prostitute advice center in berlin .
" we expect some great revenues .
it 'll be good business . " but there are fears that many of the women who end up working in the sex trade at the 2006 world cup will have been coerced into prostitution or duped by criminal gangs . solwodi , an organization that comes to the aid of women in difficulty , said that many of the illegal prostitutes would come into the country recruited under false pretences , attracted by offers of jobs as baby-sitters , bar workers or waitresses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women have been forced to work the streets by gangsters " we do n't know exactly how many women could be forced into prostituting themselves , " said brunhilde raiser , head of the national council of women in germany that has launched a campaign dubbed " red card to forced prostitution . " " but what is sure is that prostitution will increase enormously , " raiser said . german soccer team asked for its support to ramp up public support for its red card campaign , the national council of women has asked players from the german national football team to take part . " as a member of the german national team , you are a model for many men in this country and you know that your choice often counts for more than that of politicians , " the council said in its letter to goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" say to those that think themselves ' real men ' that ' real men ' are rightly against trade in women and forced prostitution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann has been the only german squad member to support the campaign kahn 's main rival for the starting goalkeeper 's position , jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , has been the only one to reply so far , the council admitted . " he said he would speak to his colleagues , " raiser said . " we have n't heard anything from him since and all the others are silent . " as for the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said in a letter to the former minister for families , renate schmidt , that neither the dfb nor the world cup organizing committee wanted to be " active " in the campaign . " we receive demands for support every day , " mayer-vorfelder said . businesses looking to capitalize on prostitution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany legalized prostitution in designated areas in 2001 but while concerns remain over the unwanted influx , entrepreneurs are working hard to capitalize on the business of sex in a country where prostitution was legalized in 2001 - but only in designated areas . cologne and dortmund , two of the host cities for the world cup , have even erected a number of wooden " sex huts " for the football showpiece with condoms and showers at hand .
the idea is to keep the prostitutes and their clients away from public places .
berlin is considering following suit . " it is better than having the couples in public areas , " said dirk lamprecht , a member of the administrative council in berlin . in berlin itself , a five-million-euro brothel has just opened in 3,000 square meters of a refurbished warehouse just three train stops from the main world cup venue , the olympic stadium . the four-story building will accommodate up to 100 prostitutes and 650 male clients . its owners will demand that its sex workers provide their tax number and proof of permission to work in the european union . " we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " norman jacob , a lawyer for the brothel operators , said of the world cup .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening .
business will be booming .

" our net payments must fall , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
it was not possible " one day to urge germany to respect the maastricht criteria " while " already the next day it is not being ruled out in europe that germany should strengthen its position as a net contributor , " he said . steinbrück is a member of the germany 's social democratic party , which forms a grand coalition government with the conservative christian union parties led by chancellor angela merkel . since 2002 germany has been in breach of the maastricht criteria , encoded in the eu stability and growth pact , which lay down among other requirements that a nation 's budget deficit should not exceed three percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück previously served as premier of north rhine-westphalia on monday steinbrück will make his debut as finance minister at a meeting of eu economy and finance ministers in brussels . " there exist in germany some special factors , which we need to explain to partner countries , " he told the newspaper . these included the reunification of west and east germany after 1990 and the reforms launched in 2003 by then chancellor gerhard schröder in the context of the agenda 2010 project . germany and sweden are the two biggest net contributors to the eu budget . eu budget deal impossible ? britain meanwhile warned on saturday that it may not be able to secure a long sought-after deal on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget at the bloc 's next summit in just under two weeks . the government in london , which holds the eu presidency until dec .
31 , is due to submit its first concrete proposals on resolving the budget impasse to its counterparts on monday . " i think probably by the end of next week we will have a clearer idea of whether a deal can actually be done , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , told bbc radio .
" if a deal was not done then i think it would be greatly to our disadvantage , but that may be where we end up .
we are not prepared to sign any deal .
we want to try and get the right deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will british prime minister tony blair find backers for his proposals ?
britain 's offer will be studied by eu foreign ministers at a specially called " conclave " on wednesday in hopes that a deal can be inked by the bloc 's leaders at their summit in brussels on dec .
15-16 . britain has warned that it wants substantial changes made to the previous budget plan , tabled by the luxembourg presidency in june and which was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . leaked details of monday 's offer suggest prime minister tony blair will propose cutting funds to the newcomer states in central and eastern europe . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , last week urged blair not to take from the poor to give to the rich . britai n ready to budge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants to keep its agricultural subsidies the deal is blocked on two key issues : britain 's refusal to surrender its substantial budget rebate , and french resistance to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is a major beneficiary as the biggest agricultural producer in the union . alexander hinted that britain could be prepared to reduce its rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for cutting its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies . " we were clear at the start of our presidency , that we did recognize it was fair for each of us to make contribution towards those costs of enlargement in these poorer countries that have come into the eu , " he said . the rebate averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 , but critics say britain 's economic position has greatly improved since it was first granted . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

15-16 . britain has warned that it wants substantial changes made to the previous budget plan , tabled by the luxembourg presidency in june and which was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . leaked details of monday 's offer suggest prime minister tony blair will propose cutting funds to the newcomer states in central and eastern europe . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , last week urged blair not to take from the poor to give to the rich . britai n ready to budge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants to keep its agricultural subsidies the deal is blocked on two key issues : britain 's refusal to surrender its substantial budget rebate , and french resistance to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is a major beneficiary as the biggest agricultural producer in the union . alexander hinted that britain could be prepared to reduce its rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for cutting its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies . " we were clear at the start of our presidency , that we did recognize it was fair for each of us to make contribution towards those costs of enlargement in these poorer countries that have come into the eu , " he said . the rebate averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 , but critics say britain 's economic position has greatly improved since it was first granted . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

" our net payments must fall , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
it was not possible " one day to urge germany to respect the maastricht criteria " while " already the next day it is not being ruled out in europe that germany should strengthen its position as a net contributor , " he said . steinbrück is a member of the germany 's social democratic party , which forms a grand coalition government with the conservative christian union parties led by chancellor angela merkel . since 2002 germany has been in breach of the maastricht criteria , encoded in the eu stability and growth pact , which lay down among other requirements that a nation 's budget deficit should not exceed three percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück previously served as premier of north rhine-westphalia on monday steinbrück will make his debut as finance minister at a meeting of eu economy and finance ministers in brussels . " there exist in germany some special factors , which we need to explain to partner countries , " he told the newspaper . these included the reunification of west and east germany after 1990 and the reforms launched in 2003 by then chancellor gerhard schröder in the context of the agenda 2010 project . germany and sweden are the two biggest net contributors to the eu budget . eu budget deal impossible ? britain meanwhile warned on saturday that it may not be able to secure a long sought-after deal on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget at the bloc 's next summit in just under two weeks . the government in london , which holds the eu presidency until dec .
31 , is due to submit its first concrete proposals on resolving the budget impasse to its counterparts on monday . " i think probably by the end of next week we will have a clearer idea of whether a deal can actually be done , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , told bbc radio .
" if a deal was not done then i think it would be greatly to our disadvantage , but that may be where we end up .
we are not prepared to sign any deal .
we want to try and get the right deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will british prime minister tony blair find backers for his proposals ?
britain 's offer will be studied by eu foreign ministers at a specially called " conclave " on wednesday in hopes that a deal can be inked by the bloc 's leaders at their summit in brussels on dec .
15-16 . britain has warned that it wants substantial changes made to the previous budget plan , tabled by the luxembourg presidency in june and which was rejected by britain , finland , the netherlands , spain and sweden . leaked details of monday 's offer suggest prime minister tony blair will propose cutting funds to the newcomer states in central and eastern europe . the european commission , the eu 's executive branch , last week urged blair not to take from the poor to give to the rich . britai n ready to budge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france wants to keep its agricultural subsidies the deal is blocked on two key issues : britain 's refusal to surrender its substantial budget rebate , and french resistance to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is a major beneficiary as the biggest agricultural producer in the union . alexander hinted that britain could be prepared to reduce its rebate , a jealously-guarded mechanism for cutting its financial burden because it profits little from subsidies . " we were clear at the start of our presidency , that we did recognize it was fair for each of us to make contribution towards those costs of enlargement in these poorer countries that have come into the eu , " he said . the rebate averaged 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- annually between 1997 and 2003 , but critics say britain 's economic position has greatly improved since it was first granted . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

" i believe that relations are very good and i have the strong impression that the polish president-elect is also interested in very good relations with germany and in the forward-looking positions that we can adopt together , " merkel said after talks with lech kaczynski . but the chancellor , accompanied on the visit by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , acknowledged problems would have to be discussed , " notably , of course , the baltic sea pipeline .

this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments i had spent over two hours this morning trying to access a number of sites -lrb- ticketmaster , ticketline , aloud.com and the nec group -rrb- to buy tickets for my wife , but to no avail .
all sites were swamped , unavailable or out of service and the phone lines were just as bad - permanently engaged .
eventually i had to drive to the nec box office and buy them in person .
matthew evans , birmingham , uk i just managed to get tickets having been on line since bang on nine this morning .
i got tickets directly from the wembley website for 25 may but the seat at right at the back of the arena - still better than nothing ! ! !
carol , greece i have tried since 9am this morning for tickets from hallam fm arena and have had no luck whatsoever .
i have tried websites seetickets , ticketmaster etc ... and have had no luck at all .
i am really disappointed .
please take that add more dates .
dawn outram , worksop , notts i spent over two and a half hours trying to get tickets on four different websites and every time i got close the websites shut down .
two of the websites did n't even say when tickets were sold out !
what a waste of time ! ! !
sarah o 'hanlon , nantwich i tried from 9am .
all i wanted was five tickets for my family to go .
i was trying the websites and i was just going round in circles , the same as the phones .
i finally managed to get three tickets at 2:30 this afternoon .
it annoys me that people buy tickets and go on to sell them on ebay .
those tickets could have gone to someone who really wanted them and could n't get them .
natalie , london my daughter and myself have been trying the internet and phone all day separately and neither of us have got through , are all dates on sale ?
janet hardman , manchester i had no problems getting my tickets this morning , but i did note that ticketmaster 's online service opened a few minutes earlier than expected , meaning that i was just lucky ...
i think matthew evans who bought tickets for his wife is my hero !
georgia burns , newcastle , uk two hours wasted , flitting between all the different websites and phone numbers with no luck what so ever !
only to hear that i can only get them from the sharks that are now selling them on ebay for 10 times the ticket value .
what can i do to get tickets the legitimate way ? ? ?
julie gray , fareham , hampshire i could n't get away from work to get tickets for either the glasgow or newcastle gig .
ticketmaster etc were my only option .
i am left very disappointed and what makes me angry is that people who did n't actually want the tickets are selling them on ebay for £ 500 a shot which was n't very fair on the true fans .
emma , bathgate , scotland i tried from 9am this morning when the tickets went on sale and it took me over an hour and a half to get them with the use of many windows open and this was only when the second extra manchester date was added .
it 'll be well worth it though !
sarah , manchester the websites were a nightmare , none of them working and phone lines constantly jammed .
they need to do something to improve the situation .
emma castle , edinburgh i spent over three and a half hours trying to buy tickets this morning from all the online sites and on the phone as well .
luckily i finally managed to buy the tickets online from seetickets .
i was rather frustrated at the time but i feel very lucky now !
claire lokie , harrogate , uk i started trying to get tickets from the internet from 9am .
i had huge problems trying to even access the web pages and when i finally could all the tickets had sold out .
i refreshed the page one last time to see a new date had been added and got them there and then .
less than five minutes later that new date had sold out as well .
i 'm so happy though !
charlotte , brighton i spent from 8:50 to past midday trying to get tickets .
the phone lines were jammed and all internet sites were too busy to handle the demand .
but with luck at just after midday i finally got the tickets -lrb- not the best in the world -rrb- .
i am pleased but do feel sorry for the true fans whom where not able to be as lucky .
i just hope people do n't start selling them at high prices .
james moore , aldershot , hampshire i had no luck trying to get tickets either on the secc website or ticketmaster or on the telephone .
as usual people in scotland find it harder to get tickets due to the fact that there are only two dates in glasgow for the whole of scotland .
there should be more than two dates or they should be playing more places in scotland than just glasgow .
alison sherriffs , aberdeen i logged on at 9am and had my tickets from ticketmaster by 9.10am.
emma , birmingham i was trying from 8.45 this morning with no such luck .
all the internet sites and phone lines where jammed .
i am so frustrated .. it was n't this difficult to get tickets first time around .
emma , manchester , england there are five people in our office , and we all managed to get tickets to the venues we wanted via ticketmaster .
yes it was busy , but sticking with the same website obviously work for us .
caroline , leeds took me almost two hours , but with some perseverance on the ticketmaster website i finally got two tickets so i could take my fiance .
had to wait for the third lot of extra shows to be released , but it was a huge relief when they were .
rob , manchester , england i tried from 9.00 this morning to get tickets from the ticketmaster website , and also aloud.com.
both websites said no seats available but i eventually got through on the phones at 12.30 and got two seats at newcastle louise , durham such was my determination to get tickets that i took the day off work !
seems like i had n't underestimated the scramble for tickets as i could n't access one website , and that was trying from before 9am .
decided to give the websites a miss and concentrate on the phone lines .
i finally got through to the men , only to find that both dates were completely sold out .
luckily it seems as though i got through as they released the third date and was able to get my four tickets .
lizzie g , poole , dorset i was online before 9am and searched for the best available tickets for the wembley gig on 8 may .
at 9.01am i got a page telling me that the best available ticket was in the upper side tier near the corner .
i tried throughout the day and as more and more dates were added i was never able to get anything near the front .
the ticket agencies need to be much more transparent about what tickets they actually have on sale .
phil , london i have been trying since 9am this morning for the newcastle dates .
i have had no luck at all .
the websites kept crashing and the phone lines were constantly engaged .
very disappointed that i have n't been fortunate enough , especially as the tickets were on ebay by 10am this morning for ridiculous amounts of money .
please add more dates to newcastle so those of us who have n't been lucky enough to get tickets so far can go !
anon , newcastle i logged on at 8.45 , unable to access the sheffield hallam fm arena website .
the sheffield arena box office hotline was jammed all morning .
i tried ticketmaster etc but all jammed .
very disappointed .
i hope its not another 10 years before they tour again .
alison , huddersfield i managed to get tickets for birmingham via the ticketline phone number and have got a ticket and bus for £ 60 which i feel is well worth it .
think yourself lucky in england , scotland , n ireland , ireland .
they did n't put on any dates in cardiff !
abby , wales i was on the phone and the websites from nine this morning .
on the wembley site i booked tickets and gave all my details but the site crashed before the order had gone through .
this happened on many occasions and was very frustrating as each time i had to start again , and each time i started again more of the dates had sold out .
i managed to get some from ticketmaster when they had announced a new date .
lizzie , maidenhead absolutely gutted .
i have been phoning and going online since 10 this morning - constantly engaged and the web continually failing .
i refuse to pay hundreds of pounds .
oh well maybe next year ! !
joanna brown , birmingham i queued at the nec box office from 5.15am.
by 9 i was wet and tired , but i got fourth row tickets .
i have tried websites and phone lines before , and decided the only way to make sure i had tickets was to buy them in person .
emma , birmingham finally got tickets to the last date in wembley after the gig was added .
the websites were either jammed or out of date .
i got through the automated booking only to find that there were no tickets available and they had not been updated with the extra dates .
it was an utter shambles and did n't represent the professionalism of the boys .
mark , hertford i went on ticketmaster at 9am and was lucky enough to come across two tickets by 9.45am.
i feel sorry for anyone who has n't managed to get any , but i 'm certainly not complaining .
my mate actually tried to get me to put them on ebay , she said i could make my money back 10 times over .
but this is n't about the profit , i 've been waiting for take that to reform for nearly 10 years .
it 's a dream come true , and i would n't trade them in for the world .
natasha bowie , wellingborough , northamptonshire i must have been very lucky .
i logged into ticketmaster just before 8.55am , kept refreshing until 9am and got through without any problems .
i ca n't believe that i actually got row 9 seats for take that in belfast kathy , northern ireland i was lucky enough to fluke two tickets for the sheffield gig from seetickets.com , but that was after trying for newcastle tickets for three hours .
so although i have to travel and stay in sheffield , i suppose i 'm one of the lucky ones !
sian , sunderland tried for three hours from nine to get tickets from nec on website but kept crashing never got anywhere near to booking .
phone line constantly engaged .
ticketmaster not much better eventually luckily got some elsewhere for wembley .
surely there must be something the venues can do to stop the sale of tickets on places like ebay so only those who genuinely want to go can get tickets .
sarah ventrella , cheltenham , glos i spent four hours today trying to get tickets for the nec .
i reached the payment screens of the nec website twice but then it froze .
i eventually got a message telling me that my order had been processed but there was also an error message on the screen .
i had to call the nec technical team to find out what was going on .
they confirmed that my order had been processed and i had four tickets .
rob clarke , west midlands i tried on ticketmaster as soon as i got into work to get some tickets for my sister and a couple of her friends .
sadly , no luck , simply no chance if you were n't online before 9.10 .
my sister resigned to defeat , i persevered , and by 11am , the new dates showed up .
three tickets right near the front !
my sister overjoyed , she now simply has to wait six months .
peter , brighton i was lucky enough to book four consecutive nights in a row .
each night i get closer and closer to the boys !
lucky me ! -lrb- with a very understanding husband -rrb- kerry brant , bournemouth , dorset ticketmaster worked very well ! !
i got tickets for dublin and london !
frederique , netherlands my sister has been trying ticketmaster all day - i went on the wembley site at 3.30pm and got five tickets straight away .
just tried to revisit it for a friend and now all gone .
katie , dover i tried to call wembley at 8.45am and it was engaged even then !
i think the tickets went on sale at about 8.55am because all the best things had gone by 9am .
i eventually got tickets for the wembley 26 may date - at gone one in the afternoon !
i could n't believe the rate they were selling out .
unbelievable !
nicola , eastbourne , east sussex i tried for two-and-a-half hours , using different windows and websites !
eventually getting through to ticketmaster .
so relieved i got tickets !
it was a nightmare .
i think its disgusting that so many people are just buying them to sell on ebay at ridiculous prices . this needs to stop !

this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments i had spent over two hours this morning trying to access a number of sites -lrb- ticketmaster , ticketline , aloud.com and the nec group -rrb- to buy tickets for my wife , but to no avail .
all sites were swamped , unavailable or out of service and the phone lines were just as bad - permanently engaged .
eventually i had to drive to the nec box office and buy them in person .
matthew evans , birmingham , uk i just managed to get tickets having been on line since bang on nine this morning .
i got tickets directly from the wembley website for 25 may but the seat at right at the back of the arena - still better than nothing ! ! !
carol , greece i have tried since 9am this morning for tickets from hallam fm arena and have had no luck whatsoever .
i have tried websites seetickets , ticketmaster etc ... and have had no luck at all .
i am really disappointed .
please take that add more dates .
dawn outram , worksop , notts i spent over two and a half hours trying to get tickets on four different websites and every time i got close the websites shut down .
two of the websites did n't even say when tickets were sold out !
what a waste of time ! ! !
sarah o 'hanlon , nantwich i tried from 9am .
all i wanted was five tickets for my family to go .
i was trying the websites and i was just going round in circles , the same as the phones .
i finally managed to get three tickets at 2:30 this afternoon .
it annoys me that people buy tickets and go on to sell them on ebay .
those tickets could have gone to someone who really wanted them and could n't get them .
natalie , london my daughter and myself have been trying the internet and phone all day separately and neither of us have got through , are all dates on sale ?
janet hardman , manchester i had no problems getting my tickets this morning , but i did note that ticketmaster 's online service opened a few minutes earlier than expected , meaning that i was just lucky ...
i think matthew evans who bought tickets for his wife is my hero !
georgia burns , newcastle , uk two hours wasted , flitting between all the different websites and phone numbers with no luck what so ever !
only to hear that i can only get them from the sharks that are now selling them on ebay for 10 times the ticket value .
what can i do to get tickets the legitimate way ? ? ?
julie gray , fareham , hampshire i could n't get away from work to get tickets for either the glasgow or newcastle gig .
ticketmaster etc were my only option .
i am left very disappointed and what makes me angry is that people who did n't actually want the tickets are selling them on ebay for £ 500 a shot which was n't very fair on the true fans .
emma , bathgate , scotland i tried from 9am this morning when the tickets went on sale and it took me over an hour and a half to get them with the use of many windows open and this was only when the second extra manchester date was added .
it 'll be well worth it though !
sarah , manchester the websites were a nightmare , none of them working and phone lines constantly jammed .
they need to do something to improve the situation .
emma castle , edinburgh i spent over three and a half hours trying to buy tickets this morning from all the online sites and on the phone as well .
luckily i finally managed to buy the tickets online from seetickets .
i was rather frustrated at the time but i feel very lucky now !
claire lokie , harrogate , uk i started trying to get tickets from the internet from 9am .
i had huge problems trying to even access the web pages and when i finally could all the tickets had sold out .
i refreshed the page one last time to see a new date had been added and got them there and then .
less than five minutes later that new date had sold out as well .
i 'm so happy though !
charlotte , brighton i spent from 8:50 to past midday trying to get tickets .
the phone lines were jammed and all internet sites were too busy to handle the demand .
but with luck at just after midday i finally got the tickets -lrb- not the best in the world -rrb- .
i am pleased but do feel sorry for the true fans whom where not able to be as lucky .
i just hope people do n't start selling them at high prices .
james moore , aldershot , hampshire i had no luck trying to get tickets either on the secc website or ticketmaster or on the telephone .
as usual people in scotland find it harder to get tickets due to the fact that there are only two dates in glasgow for the whole of scotland .
there should be more than two dates or they should be playing more places in scotland than just glasgow .
alison sherriffs , aberdeen i logged on at 9am and had my tickets from ticketmaster by 9.10am.
emma , birmingham i was trying from 8.45 this morning with no such luck .
all the internet sites and phone lines where jammed .
i am so frustrated .. it was n't this difficult to get tickets first time around .
emma , manchester , england there are five people in our office , and we all managed to get tickets to the venues we wanted via ticketmaster .
yes it was busy , but sticking with the same website obviously work for us .
caroline , leeds took me almost two hours , but with some perseverance on the ticketmaster website i finally got two tickets so i could take my fiance .
had to wait for the third lot of extra shows to be released , but it was a huge relief when they were .
rob , manchester , england i tried from 9.00 this morning to get tickets from the ticketmaster website , and also aloud.com.
both websites said no seats available but i eventually got through on the phones at 12.30 and got two seats at newcastle louise , durham such was my determination to get tickets that i took the day off work !
seems like i had n't underestimated the scramble for tickets as i could n't access one website , and that was trying from before 9am .
decided to give the websites a miss and concentrate on the phone lines .
i finally got through to the men , only to find that both dates were completely sold out .
luckily it seems as though i got through as they released the third date and was able to get my four tickets .
lizzie g , poole , dorset i was online before 9am and searched for the best available tickets for the wembley gig on 8 may .
at 9.01am i got a page telling me that the best available ticket was in the upper side tier near the corner .
i tried throughout the day and as more and more dates were added i was never able to get anything near the front .
the ticket agencies need to be much more transparent about what tickets they actually have on sale .
phil , london i have been trying since 9am this morning for the newcastle dates .
i have had no luck at all .
the websites kept crashing and the phone lines were constantly engaged .
very disappointed that i have n't been fortunate enough , especially as the tickets were on ebay by 10am this morning for ridiculous amounts of money .
please add more dates to newcastle so those of us who have n't been lucky enough to get tickets so far can go !
anon , newcastle i logged on at 8.45 , unable to access the sheffield hallam fm arena website .
the sheffield arena box office hotline was jammed all morning .
i tried ticketmaster etc but all jammed .
very disappointed .
i hope its not another 10 years before they tour again .
alison , huddersfield i managed to get tickets for birmingham via the ticketline phone number and have got a ticket and bus for £ 60 which i feel is well worth it .
think yourself lucky in england , scotland , n ireland , ireland .
they did n't put on any dates in cardiff !
abby , wales i was on the phone and the websites from nine this morning .
on the wembley site i booked tickets and gave all my details but the site crashed before the order had gone through .
this happened on many occasions and was very frustrating as each time i had to start again , and each time i started again more of the dates had sold out .
i managed to get some from ticketmaster when they had announced a new date .
lizzie , maidenhead absolutely gutted .
i have been phoning and going online since 10 this morning - constantly engaged and the web continually failing .
i refuse to pay hundreds of pounds .
oh well maybe next year ! !
joanna brown , birmingham i queued at the nec box office from 5.15am.
by 9 i was wet and tired , but i got fourth row tickets .
i have tried websites and phone lines before , and decided the only way to make sure i had tickets was to buy them in person .
emma , birmingham finally got tickets to the last date in wembley after the gig was added .
the websites were either jammed or out of date .
i got through the automated booking only to find that there were no tickets available and they had not been updated with the extra dates .
it was an utter shambles and did n't represent the professionalism of the boys .
mark , hertford i went on ticketmaster at 9am and was lucky enough to come across two tickets by 9.45am.
i feel sorry for anyone who has n't managed to get any , but i 'm certainly not complaining .
my mate actually tried to get me to put them on ebay , she said i could make my money back 10 times over .
but this is n't about the profit , i 've been waiting for take that to reform for nearly 10 years .
it 's a dream come true , and i would n't trade them in for the world .
natasha bowie , wellingborough , northamptonshire i must have been very lucky .
i logged into ticketmaster just before 8.55am , kept refreshing until 9am and got through without any problems .
i ca n't believe that i actually got row 9 seats for take that in belfast kathy , northern ireland i was lucky enough to fluke two tickets for the sheffield gig from seetickets.com , but that was after trying for newcastle tickets for three hours .
so although i have to travel and stay in sheffield , i suppose i 'm one of the lucky ones !
sian , sunderland tried for three hours from nine to get tickets from nec on website but kept crashing never got anywhere near to booking .
phone line constantly engaged .
ticketmaster not much better eventually luckily got some elsewhere for wembley .
surely there must be something the venues can do to stop the sale of tickets on places like ebay so only those who genuinely want to go can get tickets .
sarah ventrella , cheltenham , glos i spent four hours today trying to get tickets for the nec .
i reached the payment screens of the nec website twice but then it froze .
i eventually got a message telling me that my order had been processed but there was also an error message on the screen .
i had to call the nec technical team to find out what was going on .
they confirmed that my order had been processed and i had four tickets .
rob clarke , west midlands i tried on ticketmaster as soon as i got into work to get some tickets for my sister and a couple of her friends .
sadly , no luck , simply no chance if you were n't online before 9.10 .
my sister resigned to defeat , i persevered , and by 11am , the new dates showed up .
three tickets right near the front !
my sister overjoyed , she now simply has to wait six months .
peter , brighton i was lucky enough to book four consecutive nights in a row .
each night i get closer and closer to the boys !
lucky me ! -lrb- with a very understanding husband -rrb- kerry brant , bournemouth , dorset ticketmaster worked very well ! !
i got tickets for dublin and london !
frederique , netherlands my sister has been trying ticketmaster all day - i went on the wembley site at 3.30pm and got five tickets straight away .
just tried to revisit it for a friend and now all gone .
katie , dover i tried to call wembley at 8.45am and it was engaged even then !
i think the tickets went on sale at about 8.55am because all the best things had gone by 9am .
i eventually got tickets for the wembley 26 may date - at gone one in the afternoon !
i could n't believe the rate they were selling out .
unbelievable !
nicola , eastbourne , east sussex i tried for two-and-a-half hours , using different windows and websites !
eventually getting through to ticketmaster .
so relieved i got tickets !
it was a nightmare .
i think its disgusting that so many people are just buying them to sell on ebay at ridiculous prices . this needs to stop !

this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments i had spent over two hours this morning trying to access a number of sites -lrb- ticketmaster , ticketline , aloud.com and the nec group -rrb- to buy tickets for my wife , but to no avail .
all sites were swamped , unavailable or out of service and the phone lines were just as bad - permanently engaged .
eventually i had to drive to the nec box office and buy them in person .
matthew evans , birmingham , uk i just managed to get tickets having been on line since bang on nine this morning .
i got tickets directly from the wembley website for 25 may but the seat at right at the back of the arena - still better than nothing ! ! !
carol , greece i have tried since 9am this morning for tickets from hallam fm arena and have had no luck whatsoever .
i have tried websites seetickets , ticketmaster etc ... and have had no luck at all .
i am really disappointed .
please take that add more dates .
dawn outram , worksop , notts i spent over two and a half hours trying to get tickets on four different websites and every time i got close the websites shut down .
two of the websites did n't even say when tickets were sold out !
what a waste of time ! ! !
sarah o 'hanlon , nantwich i tried from 9am .
all i wanted was five tickets for my family to go .
i was trying the websites and i was just going round in circles , the same as the phones .
i finally managed to get three tickets at 2:30 this afternoon .
it annoys me that people buy tickets and go on to sell them on ebay .
those tickets could have gone to someone who really wanted them and could n't get them .
natalie , london my daughter and myself have been trying the internet and phone all day separately and neither of us have got through , are all dates on sale ?
janet hardman , manchester i had no problems getting my tickets this morning , but i did note that ticketmaster 's online service opened a few minutes earlier than expected , meaning that i was just lucky ...
i think matthew evans who bought tickets for his wife is my hero !
georgia burns , newcastle , uk two hours wasted , flitting between all the different websites and phone numbers with no luck what so ever !
only to hear that i can only get them from the sharks that are now selling them on ebay for 10 times the ticket value .
what can i do to get tickets the legitimate way ? ? ?
julie gray , fareham , hampshire i could n't get away from work to get tickets for either the glasgow or newcastle gig .
ticketmaster etc were my only option .
i am left very disappointed and what makes me angry is that people who did n't actually want the tickets are selling them on ebay for £ 500 a shot which was n't very fair on the true fans .
emma , bathgate , scotland i tried from 9am this morning when the tickets went on sale and it took me over an hour and a half to get them with the use of many windows open and this was only when the second extra manchester date was added .
it 'll be well worth it though !
sarah , manchester the websites were a nightmare , none of them working and phone lines constantly jammed .
they need to do something to improve the situation .
emma castle , edinburgh i spent over three and a half hours trying to buy tickets this morning from all the online sites and on the phone as well .
luckily i finally managed to buy the tickets online from seetickets .
i was rather frustrated at the time but i feel very lucky now !
claire lokie , harrogate , uk i started trying to get tickets from the internet from 9am .
i had huge problems trying to even access the web pages and when i finally could all the tickets had sold out .
i refreshed the page one last time to see a new date had been added and got them there and then .
less than five minutes later that new date had sold out as well .
i 'm so happy though !
charlotte , brighton i spent from 8:50 to past midday trying to get tickets .
the phone lines were jammed and all internet sites were too busy to handle the demand .
but with luck at just after midday i finally got the tickets -lrb- not the best in the world -rrb- .
i am pleased but do feel sorry for the true fans whom where not able to be as lucky .
i just hope people do n't start selling them at high prices .
james moore , aldershot , hampshire i had no luck trying to get tickets either on the secc website or ticketmaster or on the telephone .
as usual people in scotland find it harder to get tickets due to the fact that there are only two dates in glasgow for the whole of scotland .
there should be more than two dates or they should be playing more places in scotland than just glasgow .
alison sherriffs , aberdeen i logged on at 9am and had my tickets from ticketmaster by 9.10am.
emma , birmingham i was trying from 8.45 this morning with no such luck .
all the internet sites and phone lines where jammed .
i am so frustrated .. it was n't this difficult to get tickets first time around .
emma , manchester , england there are five people in our office , and we all managed to get tickets to the venues we wanted via ticketmaster .
yes it was busy , but sticking with the same website obviously work for us .
caroline , leeds took me almost two hours , but with some perseverance on the ticketmaster website i finally got two tickets so i could take my fiance .
had to wait for the third lot of extra shows to be released , but it was a huge relief when they were .
rob , manchester , england i tried from 9.00 this morning to get tickets from the ticketmaster website , and also aloud.com.
both websites said no seats available but i eventually got through on the phones at 12.30 and got two seats at newcastle louise , durham such was my determination to get tickets that i took the day off work !
seems like i had n't underestimated the scramble for tickets as i could n't access one website , and that was trying from before 9am .
decided to give the websites a miss and concentrate on the phone lines .
i finally got through to the men , only to find that both dates were completely sold out .
luckily it seems as though i got through as they released the third date and was able to get my four tickets .
lizzie g , poole , dorset i was online before 9am and searched for the best available tickets for the wembley gig on 8 may .
at 9.01am i got a page telling me that the best available ticket was in the upper side tier near the corner .
i tried throughout the day and as more and more dates were added i was never able to get anything near the front .
the ticket agencies need to be much more transparent about what tickets they actually have on sale .
phil , london i have been trying since 9am this morning for the newcastle dates .
i have had no luck at all .
the websites kept crashing and the phone lines were constantly engaged .
very disappointed that i have n't been fortunate enough , especially as the tickets were on ebay by 10am this morning for ridiculous amounts of money .
please add more dates to newcastle so those of us who have n't been lucky enough to get tickets so far can go !
anon , newcastle i logged on at 8.45 , unable to access the sheffield hallam fm arena website .
the sheffield arena box office hotline was jammed all morning .
i tried ticketmaster etc but all jammed .
very disappointed .
i hope its not another 10 years before they tour again .
alison , huddersfield i managed to get tickets for birmingham via the ticketline phone number and have got a ticket and bus for £ 60 which i feel is well worth it .
think yourself lucky in england , scotland , n ireland , ireland .
they did n't put on any dates in cardiff !
abby , wales i was on the phone and the websites from nine this morning .
on the wembley site i booked tickets and gave all my details but the site crashed before the order had gone through .
this happened on many occasions and was very frustrating as each time i had to start again , and each time i started again more of the dates had sold out .
i managed to get some from ticketmaster when they had announced a new date .
lizzie , maidenhead absolutely gutted .
i have been phoning and going online since 10 this morning - constantly engaged and the web continually failing .
i refuse to pay hundreds of pounds .
oh well maybe next year ! !
joanna brown , birmingham i queued at the nec box office from 5.15am.
by 9 i was wet and tired , but i got fourth row tickets .
i have tried websites and phone lines before , and decided the only way to make sure i had tickets was to buy them in person .
emma , birmingham finally got tickets to the last date in wembley after the gig was added .
the websites were either jammed or out of date .
i got through the automated booking only to find that there were no tickets available and they had not been updated with the extra dates .
it was an utter shambles and did n't represent the professionalism of the boys .
mark , hertford i went on ticketmaster at 9am and was lucky enough to come across two tickets by 9.45am.
i feel sorry for anyone who has n't managed to get any , but i 'm certainly not complaining .
my mate actually tried to get me to put them on ebay , she said i could make my money back 10 times over .
but this is n't about the profit , i 've been waiting for take that to reform for nearly 10 years .
it 's a dream come true , and i would n't trade them in for the world .
natasha bowie , wellingborough , northamptonshire i must have been very lucky .
i logged into ticketmaster just before 8.55am , kept refreshing until 9am and got through without any problems .
i ca n't believe that i actually got row 9 seats for take that in belfast kathy , northern ireland i was lucky enough to fluke two tickets for the sheffield gig from seetickets.com , but that was after trying for newcastle tickets for three hours .
so although i have to travel and stay in sheffield , i suppose i 'm one of the lucky ones !
sian , sunderland tried for three hours from nine to get tickets from nec on website but kept crashing never got anywhere near to booking .
phone line constantly engaged .
ticketmaster not much better eventually luckily got some elsewhere for wembley .
surely there must be something the venues can do to stop the sale of tickets on places like ebay so only those who genuinely want to go can get tickets .
sarah ventrella , cheltenham , glos i spent four hours today trying to get tickets for the nec .
i reached the payment screens of the nec website twice but then it froze .
i eventually got a message telling me that my order had been processed but there was also an error message on the screen .
i had to call the nec technical team to find out what was going on .
they confirmed that my order had been processed and i had four tickets .
rob clarke , west midlands i tried on ticketmaster as soon as i got into work to get some tickets for my sister and a couple of her friends .
sadly , no luck , simply no chance if you were n't online before 9.10 .
my sister resigned to defeat , i persevered , and by 11am , the new dates showed up .
three tickets right near the front !
my sister overjoyed , she now simply has to wait six months .
peter , brighton i was lucky enough to book four consecutive nights in a row .
each night i get closer and closer to the boys !
lucky me ! -lrb- with a very understanding husband -rrb- kerry brant , bournemouth , dorset ticketmaster worked very well ! !
i got tickets for dublin and london !
frederique , netherlands my sister has been trying ticketmaster all day - i went on the wembley site at 3.30pm and got five tickets straight away .
just tried to revisit it for a friend and now all gone .
katie , dover i tried to call wembley at 8.45am and it was engaged even then !
i think the tickets went on sale at about 8.55am because all the best things had gone by 9am .
i eventually got tickets for the wembley 26 may date - at gone one in the afternoon !
i could n't believe the rate they were selling out .
unbelievable !
nicola , eastbourne , east sussex i tried for two-and-a-half hours , using different windows and websites !
eventually getting through to ticketmaster .
so relieved i got tickets !
it was a nightmare .
i think its disgusting that so many people are just buying them to sell on ebay at ridiculous prices . this needs to stop !

" we always knew our fans were great , as they used to follow us around , but the response from them today has been overwhelming and we are so grateful for their loyalty and support . "
the rolling stones have added a second date to the uk leg of their a bigger bang tour at wembley stadium on 22 august .
their first concert at the venue on 20 august sold out in less than an hour , a spokesman said .
have you had difficulties purchasing take that tickets ?
a selection of your comments will appear here .
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments i had spent over two hours this morning trying to access a number of sites -lrb- ticketmaster , ticketline , aloud.com and the nec group -rrb- to buy tickets for my wife , but to no avail .
all sites were swamped , unavailable or out of service and the phone lines were just as bad - permanently engaged .
eventually i had to drive to the nec box office and buy them in person .
matthew evans , birmingham , uk i just managed to get tickets having been on line since bang on nine this morning .
i got tickets directly from the wembley website for 25 may but the seat at right at the back of the arena - still better than nothing ! ! !
carol , greece i have tried since 9am this morning for tickets from hallam fm arena and have had no luck whatsoever .
i have tried websites seetickets , ticketmaster etc ... and have had no luck at all .
i am really disappointed .
please take that add more dates .
dawn outram , worksop , notts i spent over two and a half hours trying to get tickets on four different websites and every time i got close the websites shut down .
two of the websites did n't even say when tickets were sold out !
what a waste of time ! ! !
sarah o 'hanlon , nantwich i tried from 9am .
all i wanted was five tickets for my family to go .
i was trying the websites and i was just going round in circles , the same as the phones .
i finally managed to get three tickets at 2:30 this afternoon .
it annoys me that people buy tickets and go on to sell them on ebay .
those tickets could have gone to someone who really wanted them and could n't get them .
natalie , london my daughter and myself have been trying the internet and phone all day separately and neither of us have got through , are all dates on sale ?
janet hardman , manchester i had no problems getting my tickets this morning , but i did note that ticketmaster 's online service opened a few minutes earlier than expected , meaning that i was just lucky ...
i think matthew evans who bought tickets for his wife is my hero !
georgia burns , newcastle , uk two hours wasted , flitting between all the different websites and phone numbers with no luck what so ever !
only to hear that i can only get them from the sharks that are now selling them on ebay for 10 times the ticket value .
what can i do to get tickets the legitimate way ? ? ?
julie gray , fareham , hampshire i could n't get away from work to get tickets for either the glasgow or newcastle gig .
ticketmaster etc were my only option .
i am left very disappointed and what makes me angry is that people who did n't actually want the tickets are selling them on ebay for £ 500 a shot which was n't very fair on the true fans .
emma , bathgate , scotland i tried from 9am this morning when the tickets went on sale and it took me over an hour and a half to get them with the use of many windows open and this was only when the second extra manchester date was added .
it 'll be well worth it though !
sarah , manchester the websites were a nightmare , none of them working and phone lines constantly jammed .
they need to do something to improve the situation .
emma castle , edinburgh i spent over three and a half hours trying to buy tickets this morning from all the online sites and on the phone as well .
luckily i finally managed to buy the tickets online from seetickets .
i was rather frustrated at the time but i feel very lucky now !
claire lokie , harrogate , uk i started trying to get tickets from the internet from 9am .
i had huge problems trying to even access the web pages and when i finally could all the tickets had sold out .
i refreshed the page one last time to see a new date had been added and got them there and then .
less than five minutes later that new date had sold out as well .
i 'm so happy though !
charlotte , brighton i spent from 8:50 to past midday trying to get tickets .
the phone lines were jammed and all internet sites were too busy to handle the demand .
but with luck at just after midday i finally got the tickets -lrb- not the best in the world -rrb- .
i am pleased but do feel sorry for the true fans whom where not able to be as lucky .
i just hope people do n't start selling them at high prices .
james moore , aldershot , hampshire i had no luck trying to get tickets either on the secc website or ticketmaster or on the telephone .
as usual people in scotland find it harder to get tickets due to the fact that there are only two dates in glasgow for the whole of scotland .
there should be more than two dates or they should be playing more places in scotland than just glasgow .
alison sherriffs , aberdeen i logged on at 9am and had my tickets from ticketmaster by 9.10am.
emma , birmingham i was trying from 8.45 this morning with no such luck .
all the internet sites and phone lines where jammed .
i am so frustrated .. it was n't this difficult to get tickets first time around .
emma , manchester , england there are five people in our office , and we all managed to get tickets to the venues we wanted via ticketmaster .
yes it was busy , but sticking with the same website obviously work for us .
caroline , leeds took me almost two hours , but with some perseverance on the ticketmaster website i finally got two tickets so i could take my fiance .
had to wait for the third lot of extra shows to be released , but it was a huge relief when they were .
rob , manchester , england i tried from 9.00 this morning to get tickets from the ticketmaster website , and also aloud.com.
both websites said no seats available but i eventually got through on the phones at 12.30 and got two seats at newcastle louise , durham such was my determination to get tickets that i took the day off work !
seems like i had n't underestimated the scramble for tickets as i could n't access one website , and that was trying from before 9am .
decided to give the websites a miss and concentrate on the phone lines .
i finally got through to the men , only to find that both dates were completely sold out .
luckily it seems as though i got through as they released the third date and was able to get my four tickets .
lizzie g , poole , dorset i was online before 9am and searched for the best available tickets for the wembley gig on 8 may .
at 9.01am i got a page telling me that the best available ticket was in the upper side tier near the corner .
i tried throughout the day and as more and more dates were added i was never able to get anything near the front .
the ticket agencies need to be much more transparent about what tickets they actually have on sale .
phil , london i have been trying since 9am this morning for the newcastle dates .
i have had no luck at all .
the websites kept crashing and the phone lines were constantly engaged .
very disappointed that i have n't been fortunate enough , especially as the tickets were on ebay by 10am this morning for ridiculous amounts of money .
please add more dates to newcastle so those of us who have n't been lucky enough to get tickets so far can go !
anon , newcastle i logged on at 8.45 , unable to access the sheffield hallam fm arena website .
the sheffield arena box office hotline was jammed all morning .
i tried ticketmaster etc but all jammed .
very disappointed .
i hope its not another 10 years before they tour again .
alison , huddersfield i managed to get tickets for birmingham via the ticketline phone number and have got a ticket and bus for £ 60 which i feel is well worth it .
think yourself lucky in england , scotland , n ireland , ireland .
they did n't put on any dates in cardiff !
abby , wales i was on the phone and the websites from nine this morning .
on the wembley site i booked tickets and gave all my details but the site crashed before the order had gone through .
this happened on many occasions and was very frustrating as each time i had to start again , and each time i started again more of the dates had sold out .
i managed to get some from ticketmaster when they had announced a new date .
lizzie , maidenhead absolutely gutted .
i have been phoning and going online since 10 this morning - constantly engaged and the web continually failing .
i refuse to pay hundreds of pounds .
oh well maybe next year ! !
joanna brown , birmingham i queued at the nec box office from 5.15am.
by 9 i was wet and tired , but i got fourth row tickets .
i have tried websites and phone lines before , and decided the only way to make sure i had tickets was to buy them in person .
emma , birmingham finally got tickets to the last date in wembley after the gig was added .
the websites were either jammed or out of date .
i got through the automated booking only to find that there were no tickets available and they had not been updated with the extra dates .
it was an utter shambles and did n't represent the professionalism of the boys .
mark , hertford i went on ticketmaster at 9am and was lucky enough to come across two tickets by 9.45am.
i feel sorry for anyone who has n't managed to get any , but i 'm certainly not complaining .
my mate actually tried to get me to put them on ebay , she said i could make my money back 10 times over .
but this is n't about the profit , i 've been waiting for take that to reform for nearly 10 years .
it 's a dream come true , and i would n't trade them in for the world .
natasha bowie , wellingborough , northamptonshire i must have been very lucky .
i logged into ticketmaster just before 8.55am , kept refreshing until 9am and got through without any problems .
i ca n't believe that i actually got row 9 seats for take that in belfast kathy , northern ireland i was lucky enough to fluke two tickets for the sheffield gig from seetickets.com , but that was after trying for newcastle tickets for three hours .
so although i have to travel and stay in sheffield , i suppose i 'm one of the lucky ones !
sian , sunderland tried for three hours from nine to get tickets from nec on website but kept crashing never got anywhere near to booking .
phone line constantly engaged .
ticketmaster not much better eventually luckily got some elsewhere for wembley .
surely there must be something the venues can do to stop the sale of tickets on places like ebay so only those who genuinely want to go can get tickets .
sarah ventrella , cheltenham , glos i spent four hours today trying to get tickets for the nec .
i reached the payment screens of the nec website twice but then it froze .
i eventually got a message telling me that my order had been processed but there was also an error message on the screen .
i had to call the nec technical team to find out what was going on .
they confirmed that my order had been processed and i had four tickets .
rob clarke , west midlands i tried on ticketmaster as soon as i got into work to get some tickets for my sister and a couple of her friends .
sadly , no luck , simply no chance if you were n't online before 9.10 .
my sister resigned to defeat , i persevered , and by 11am , the new dates showed up .
three tickets right near the front !
my sister overjoyed , she now simply has to wait six months .
peter , brighton i was lucky enough to book four consecutive nights in a row .
each night i get closer and closer to the boys !
lucky me ! -lrb- with a very understanding husband -rrb- kerry brant , bournemouth , dorset ticketmaster worked very well ! !
i got tickets for dublin and london !
frederique , netherlands my sister has been trying ticketmaster all day - i went on the wembley site at 3.30pm and got five tickets straight away .
just tried to revisit it for a friend and now all gone .
katie , dover i tried to call wembley at 8.45am and it was engaged even then !
i think the tickets went on sale at about 8.55am because all the best things had gone by 9am .
i eventually got tickets for the wembley 26 may date - at gone one in the afternoon !
i could n't believe the rate they were selling out .
unbelievable !
nicola , eastbourne , east sussex i tried for two-and-a-half hours , using different windows and websites !
eventually getting through to ticketmaster .
so relieved i got tickets !
it was a nightmare .
i think its disgusting that so many people are just buying them to sell on ebay at ridiculous prices . this needs to stop !
