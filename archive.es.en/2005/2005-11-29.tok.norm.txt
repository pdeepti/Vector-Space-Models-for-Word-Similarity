a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .
another click takes you to a form where you can provide your account details for a bank transfer .
when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .
bildunterschrift : potentially worth 300,000 euros not a field of flowers still , the publicity the organization gains from the campaign is at least as important as the money .
parts of zizka 's minefield has been exhibited in the rotterdam art hall , frankfurt 's schauspielhaus theater and in the german foreign office in berlin , the aim being to reach as many people as possible .
only after a second glance , does one recognize that the different-sized discs scattered on the warm beige background are n't just part of an aesthetically pleasing floor covering .
" it almost looks like a field of flowers , " said zizka .
" in the foreign office , one of the gentlemen who works there came and said , ' ah , you 're making christmas decorations ? " ' the next stop in the minefield 's tour will be the nobel museum in oslo , but part of it will already have been cleared by then .
the plates sold to donors will have been sent to the people who paid for their removal . mathias bölinger -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making afghan children smile founded in kabul , the mobile mini circus for children are bringing their show to audiences in germany and denmark .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .
" perhaps we have our own special connections .

while the new foreign minister hopes for better ties with the us , it could still be a baptism of fire . it is one of the hottest " hot potatoes " that frank-walter steinmeier is ever likely to juggle in his new role as germany 's foreign minister .
while european squabbles may prove to be the cause for many a future headache , germany 's new man abroad will find few tasks as complex and potentially combustible as dealing with the united states . steinmeier debuted in washington on monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan but the main event will be on tuesday when germany ’ s chief diplomat will hold talks with his counterpart , us secretary of state condoleezza rice . while steinmeier 's predecessor may privately lament his tenure as foreign minister being cut short by germany 's september general election and the subsequent formation of a christian union-social democrat coalition , joschka fischer is unlikely to miss sparring with the likes of messrs. cheney , powell and rumsfeld . during fischer 's seven years in the foreign office , german-us relations hit an all-time low as a direct result of gerhard schröder 's militant stand against the invasion of iraq .

earlier this month , steinmeier responded to reports that the us had requested that germany expands its activities in iraq by ruling out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly in the war-ravaged nation . however , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us .

" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship would one of the two main pillars of german foreign policy along with european integration . loyalty to schröder may rankle in washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's loyalty to his former boss could alienate some in the us while this could mean that there will be no new spats over german involvement in iraq , steinmeier will be charged with keeping a lid on old problems which could be just as challenging as avoiding new ones . a staunch supporter of the ex-chancellor and formerly schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier is a social democrat foreign minister who strongly supported his former boss ' stand against the us .
this may rub some old foes in washington the wrong way despite his arrival with olive branch in hand . if steinmeier can steer a smooth course on iraq during his meeting with rice , there are other potential storms which could blow their embryonic working relationship off course . carrying on fischer 's project of diplomacy with iran the topic of iran 's nuclear ambitions may provoke a difference of opinion as steinmeier takes over the diplomatic torch from fischer as part of the eu-3 negotiating team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice has often made her suspicions of the eu-3 public rice has been suspicious of the europeans ' efforts to resolve the crisis diplomatically and recently reiterated us willingness to bring tehran before the un security council .
while germany has led with , albeit thinning , patience , the united states has , on the whole , been more in favor of sanctions sooner rather than later . environment issues and cia bases lie in wait the new foreign minister , who revealed before his visit that he wanted to address climate issues as well , may also be faced with a backlash brought on from comments by jürgen trittin , the former environment minister , who caused outrage with " reap what you sow " statements in the aftermath of the destruction meted out on the us by hurricane katrina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could urge the us to do more to address climate change while steinmeier will undoubtedly take a more diplomatic approach , his willingness to broach the subject of climate change and germany 's own stance on the environment may hint at tense discussions on the topic at some point in his future dealings with the us . the foreign minister also said he would raise the issue of clandestine stopovers at european airports by cia planes allegedly carrying terror suspects to secret prison camps while in washington .
it is a subject that steinmeier will almost certainly direct at white house national security adviser stephen hadley when the two meet later on tuesday and one which is likely to become more sensitive as eu investigations into the flights intensify . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .

finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .
another click takes you to a form where you can provide your account details for a bank transfer .
when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .
bildunterschrift : potentially worth 300,000 euros not a field of flowers still , the publicity the organization gains from the campaign is at least as important as the money .
parts of zizka 's minefield has been exhibited in the rotterdam art hall , frankfurt 's schauspielhaus theater and in the german foreign office in berlin , the aim being to reach as many people as possible .
only after a second glance , does one recognize that the different-sized discs scattered on the warm beige background are n't just part of an aesthetically pleasing floor covering .
" it almost looks like a field of flowers , " said zizka .
" in the foreign office , one of the gentlemen who works there came and said , ' ah , you 're making christmas decorations ? " ' the next stop in the minefield 's tour will be the nobel museum in oslo , but part of it will already have been cleared by then .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .

" on the back of the reports , the us-based independent watchdog human rights watch also said it was " practically convinced " of the existence of such centers in poland and romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner , franco frattini " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said .
this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government . awaiting white house response the justice commissioner added that although the eu had made contact with washington several days earlier to get to the bottom of the allegations , brussels had so far received no " formal assurance " of the reports being untrue . the state department said on monday that it had received inquiries from europe concerning the press reports , and would be willing to answer any queries " in as complete and forthright manner " as possible when secretary of state condoleezza rice visits europe next week . the us secretary of state will also be expected to respond to reports that the cia tortured terror suspects during flights in european airspace .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .
rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .
" perhaps we have our own special connections .

a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .

a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .
another click takes you to a form where you can provide your account details for a bank transfer .
when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? europe -pipe- 29.11.2005 europe facing environmental disaster through global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice caps in the north could push europeans into the center of the continent europe is facing the worst climate change in five millennia as a result of global warming , the european environment agency warned in a report issued tuesday as the un 's summit on climate control entered its second day . europe 's four hottest years on record were 1998 , 2002 , 2003 and 2004 , the agency said . " ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .
rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .
rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

while the new foreign minister hopes for better ties with the us , it could still be a baptism of fire . it is one of the hottest " hot potatoes " that frank-walter steinmeier is ever likely to juggle in his new role as germany 's foreign minister .
while european squabbles may prove to be the cause for many a future headache , germany 's new man abroad will find few tasks as complex and potentially combustible as dealing with the united states . steinmeier debuted in washington on monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan but the main event will be on tuesday when germany ’ s chief diplomat will hold talks with his counterpart , us secretary of state condoleezza rice . while steinmeier 's predecessor may privately lament his tenure as foreign minister being cut short by germany 's september general election and the subsequent formation of a christian union-social democrat coalition , joschka fischer is unlikely to miss sparring with the likes of messrs. cheney , powell and rumsfeld . during fischer 's seven years in the foreign office , german-us relations hit an all-time low as a direct result of gerhard schröder 's militant stand against the invasion of iraq .
while schröder took regular and uncompromising flak for his stance from across the atlantic , the former chancellor very rarely had to deal with the abuse face to face .
fischer was the man who was charged with butting heads with the state department and the white house . iraq remains the main contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's staunch opposition to the iraq war still sticks in the craw despite the icy chill somewhat thawing between the two nations of late , frank-walter steinmeier will now be that point man .
while some of the personnel may have changed - rice having taken over from colin powell - the main topic remains the same : iraq . before even being sworn in , steinmeier had set out his stall on the subject that had come so very close to irrevocably damaging transatlantic relations during the summer of 2002 .
earlier this month , steinmeier responded to reports that the us had requested that germany expands its activities in iraq by ruling out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly in the war-ravaged nation . however , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship would one of the two main pillars of german foreign policy along with european integration . loyalty to schröder may rankle in washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's loyalty to his former boss could alienate some in the us while this could mean that there will be no new spats over german involvement in iraq , steinmeier will be charged with keeping a lid on old problems which could be just as challenging as avoiding new ones . a staunch supporter of the ex-chancellor and formerly schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier is a social democrat foreign minister who strongly supported his former boss ' stand against the us .
this may rub some old foes in washington the wrong way despite his arrival with olive branch in hand . if steinmeier can steer a smooth course on iraq during his meeting with rice , there are other potential storms which could blow their embryonic working relationship off course . carrying on fischer 's project of diplomacy with iran the topic of iran 's nuclear ambitions may provoke a difference of opinion as steinmeier takes over the diplomatic torch from fischer as part of the eu-3 negotiating team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice has often made her suspicions of the eu-3 public rice has been suspicious of the europeans ' efforts to resolve the crisis diplomatically and recently reiterated us willingness to bring tehran before the un security council .
while germany has led with , albeit thinning , patience , the united states has , on the whole , been more in favor of sanctions sooner rather than later . environment issues and cia bases lie in wait the new foreign minister , who revealed before his visit that he wanted to address climate issues as well , may also be faced with a backlash brought on from comments by jürgen trittin , the former environment minister , who caused outrage with " reap what you sow " statements in the aftermath of the destruction meted out on the us by hurricane katrina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could urge the us to do more to address climate change while steinmeier will undoubtedly take a more diplomatic approach , his willingness to broach the subject of climate change and germany 's own stance on the environment may hint at tense discussions on the topic at some point in his future dealings with the us . the foreign minister also said he would raise the issue of clandestine stopovers at european airports by cia planes allegedly carrying terror suspects to secret prison camps while in washington .
it is a subject that steinmeier will almost certainly direct at white house national security adviser stephen hadley when the two meet later on tuesday and one which is likely to become more sensitive as eu investigations into the flights intensify . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

fischer was the man who was charged with butting heads with the state department and the white house . iraq remains the main contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's staunch opposition to the iraq war still sticks in the craw despite the icy chill somewhat thawing between the two nations of late , frank-walter steinmeier will now be that point man .
while some of the personnel may have changed - rice having taken over from colin powell - the main topic remains the same : iraq . before even being sworn in , steinmeier had set out his stall on the subject that had come so very close to irrevocably damaging transatlantic relations during the summer of 2002 .
earlier this month , steinmeier responded to reports that the us had requested that germany expands its activities in iraq by ruling out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly in the war-ravaged nation . however , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship would one of the two main pillars of german foreign policy along with european integration . loyalty to schröder may rankle in washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's loyalty to his former boss could alienate some in the us while this could mean that there will be no new spats over german involvement in iraq , steinmeier will be charged with keeping a lid on old problems which could be just as challenging as avoiding new ones . a staunch supporter of the ex-chancellor and formerly schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier is a social democrat foreign minister who strongly supported his former boss ' stand against the us .
this may rub some old foes in washington the wrong way despite his arrival with olive branch in hand . if steinmeier can steer a smooth course on iraq during his meeting with rice , there are other potential storms which could blow their embryonic working relationship off course . carrying on fischer 's project of diplomacy with iran the topic of iran 's nuclear ambitions may provoke a difference of opinion as steinmeier takes over the diplomatic torch from fischer as part of the eu-3 negotiating team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice has often made her suspicions of the eu-3 public rice has been suspicious of the europeans ' efforts to resolve the crisis diplomatically and recently reiterated us willingness to bring tehran before the un security council .
while germany has led with , albeit thinning , patience , the united states has , on the whole , been more in favor of sanctions sooner rather than later . environment issues and cia bases lie in wait the new foreign minister , who revealed before his visit that he wanted to address climate issues as well , may also be faced with a backlash brought on from comments by jürgen trittin , the former environment minister , who caused outrage with " reap what you sow " statements in the aftermath of the destruction meted out on the us by hurricane katrina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could urge the us to do more to address climate change while steinmeier will undoubtedly take a more diplomatic approach , his willingness to broach the subject of climate change and germany 's own stance on the environment may hint at tense discussions on the topic at some point in his future dealings with the us . the foreign minister also said he would raise the issue of clandestine stopovers at european airports by cia planes allegedly carrying terror suspects to secret prison camps while in washington .
it is a subject that steinmeier will almost certainly direct at white house national security adviser stephen hadley when the two meet later on tuesday and one which is likely to become more sensitive as eu investigations into the flights intensify . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .

but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

" all the efforts of the federal government are aimed at ensuring the safety of those affected and protecting their lives , " she said . " in this difficult time , our thoughts are with the relatives and friends of those affected .
you can be sure that the government will do everything in its power to bring the two to safety as soon as possible and protect their lives . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor angela merkel faces her first international crisis .
merkel confirmed that a crisis cell at the foreign ministry had been established and was in contact " with all relevant institutions " .
she said she had spoken with the president of the federal intelligence agency . rolling news channel n24 identified the woman as 43-year-old susanne osthoff , a trained archaeologist who had been doing aid work in the country for several years . ard public television said the woman and her driver had been taken hostage friday in ninawa in the northwest of the country .

osthoff 's mother told the channel her daughter had been organizing aid shipments for iraq since the 1991 gulf war and helping to provide medical treatment , adding that she had always " showed an interest in the people , the culture and the country " . the mother said she was counting on the german government to help return her daughter , adding that she had learned of her disappearance from german federal police overnight . the mayor of her bavarian hometown glonn , martin esterl , said osterhoff had an 11-year-old daughter by a man of arab origin .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .
" perhaps we have our own special connections .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .

" the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .

europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .

the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .

a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .
another click takes you to a form where you can provide your account details for a bank transfer .
when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .
bildunterschrift : potentially worth 300,000 euros not a field of flowers still , the publicity the organization gains from the campaign is at least as important as the money .
parts of zizka 's minefield has been exhibited in the rotterdam art hall , frankfurt 's schauspielhaus theater and in the german foreign office in berlin , the aim being to reach as many people as possible .
only after a second glance , does one recognize that the different-sized discs scattered on the warm beige background are n't just part of an aesthetically pleasing floor covering .
" it almost looks like a field of flowers , " said zizka .
" in the foreign office , one of the gentlemen who works there came and said , ' ah , you 're making christmas decorations ? " ' the next stop in the minefield 's tour will be the nobel museum in oslo , but part of it will already have been cleared by then .
the plates sold to donors will have been sent to the people who paid for their removal . mathias bölinger -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making afghan children smile founded in kabul , the mobile mini circus for children are bringing their show to audiences in germany and denmark .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .

a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .
another click takes you to a form where you can provide your account details for a bank transfer .
when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .
bildunterschrift : potentially worth 300,000 euros not a field of flowers still , the publicity the organization gains from the campaign is at least as important as the money .
parts of zizka 's minefield has been exhibited in the rotterdam art hall , frankfurt 's schauspielhaus theater and in the german foreign office in berlin , the aim being to reach as many people as possible .
only after a second glance , does one recognize that the different-sized discs scattered on the warm beige background are n't just part of an aesthetically pleasing floor covering .
" it almost looks like a field of flowers , " said zizka .
" in the foreign office , one of the gentlemen who works there came and said , ' ah , you 're making christmas decorations ? " ' the next stop in the minefield 's tour will be the nobel museum in oslo , but part of it will already have been cleared by then .
the plates sold to donors will have been sent to the people who paid for their removal . mathias bölinger -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making afghan children smile founded in kabul , the mobile mini circus for children are bringing their show to audiences in germany and denmark .

" on the back of the reports , the us-based independent watchdog human rights watch also said it was " practically convinced " of the existence of such centers in poland and romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner , franco frattini " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said .
this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government . awaiting white house response the justice commissioner added that although the eu had made contact with washington several days earlier to get to the bottom of the allegations , brussels had so far received no " formal assurance " of the reports being untrue . the state department said on monday that it had received inquiries from europe concerning the press reports , and would be willing to answer any queries " in as complete and forthright manner " as possible when secretary of state condoleezza rice visits europe next week . the us secretary of state will also be expected to respond to reports that the cia tortured terror suspects during flights in european airspace .
on monday , germany 's new defense minister franz josef jung said berlin was waiting for the white house to either confirm or deny the claims that islamic extremists were tortured during cia flights , which touched down on german soil en route to secret detention centers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state , condoleezza rice us state department spokesman , sean mccormack said that rice , who is due to visit germany , romania and ukraine before heading to belgium for a nato meeting , was prepared to discuss the reported secret prisons if asked by her country 's allies .
but he gave no indication whether she would go beyond the us administration 's line , neither confirming nor denying the existence of the interrogation centers , but defending the us stance on the continued war against terror . " i think the conversation will take place in the broader context of our common struggle against terrorism , " he said . investigations underway the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly had already announced a probe into reports of the cia operating clandestine prisons in some european countries , and many eu countries including finland , italy , poland , romania and spain have opened their own investigations into the allegations of aviation aircraft stopovers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier germany has launched an investigation into a case in which an egyptian suspect was transported via ramstein , the largest us airbase on european soil , to egypt where his supporters say he was tortured . the new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , is under domestic political pressure to raise the issue in washington on tuesday when he holds his first meeting with rice since taking up office earlier this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? europe -pipe- 29.11.2005 europe facing environmental disaster through global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice caps in the north could push europeans into the center of the continent europe is facing the worst climate change in five millennia as a result of global warming , the european environment agency warned in a report issued tuesday as the un 's summit on climate control entered its second day . europe 's four hottest years on record were 1998 , 2002 , 2003 and 2004 , the agency said . " ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.11.2005 germany 's new man abroad faces early transatlantic test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will face few tasks tougher than negotiating with the us frank-walter steinmeier meets with white house officials including secretary of state condoleezza rice on tuesday .
while the new foreign minister hopes for better ties with the us , it could still be a baptism of fire . it is one of the hottest " hot potatoes " that frank-walter steinmeier is ever likely to juggle in his new role as germany 's foreign minister .
while european squabbles may prove to be the cause for many a future headache , germany 's new man abroad will find few tasks as complex and potentially combustible as dealing with the united states . steinmeier debuted in washington on monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan but the main event will be on tuesday when germany ’ s chief diplomat will hold talks with his counterpart , us secretary of state condoleezza rice . while steinmeier 's predecessor may privately lament his tenure as foreign minister being cut short by germany 's september general election and the subsequent formation of a christian union-social democrat coalition , joschka fischer is unlikely to miss sparring with the likes of messrs. cheney , powell and rumsfeld . during fischer 's seven years in the foreign office , german-us relations hit an all-time low as a direct result of gerhard schröder 's militant stand against the invasion of iraq .
while schröder took regular and uncompromising flak for his stance from across the atlantic , the former chancellor very rarely had to deal with the abuse face to face .
fischer was the man who was charged with butting heads with the state department and the white house . iraq remains the main contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's staunch opposition to the iraq war still sticks in the craw despite the icy chill somewhat thawing between the two nations of late , frank-walter steinmeier will now be that point man .
while some of the personnel may have changed - rice having taken over from colin powell - the main topic remains the same : iraq . before even being sworn in , steinmeier had set out his stall on the subject that had come so very close to irrevocably damaging transatlantic relations during the summer of 2002 .
earlier this month , steinmeier responded to reports that the us had requested that germany expands its activities in iraq by ruling out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly in the war-ravaged nation . however , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship would one of the two main pillars of german foreign policy along with european integration . loyalty to schröder may rankle in washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's loyalty to his former boss could alienate some in the us while this could mean that there will be no new spats over german involvement in iraq , steinmeier will be charged with keeping a lid on old problems which could be just as challenging as avoiding new ones . a staunch supporter of the ex-chancellor and formerly schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier is a social democrat foreign minister who strongly supported his former boss ' stand against the us .
this may rub some old foes in washington the wrong way despite his arrival with olive branch in hand . if steinmeier can steer a smooth course on iraq during his meeting with rice , there are other potential storms which could blow their embryonic working relationship off course . carrying on fischer 's project of diplomacy with iran the topic of iran 's nuclear ambitions may provoke a difference of opinion as steinmeier takes over the diplomatic torch from fischer as part of the eu-3 negotiating team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice has often made her suspicions of the eu-3 public rice has been suspicious of the europeans ' efforts to resolve the crisis diplomatically and recently reiterated us willingness to bring tehran before the un security council .
while germany has led with , albeit thinning , patience , the united states has , on the whole , been more in favor of sanctions sooner rather than later . environment issues and cia bases lie in wait the new foreign minister , who revealed before his visit that he wanted to address climate issues as well , may also be faced with a backlash brought on from comments by jürgen trittin , the former environment minister , who caused outrage with " reap what you sow " statements in the aftermath of the destruction meted out on the us by hurricane katrina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could urge the us to do more to address climate change while steinmeier will undoubtedly take a more diplomatic approach , his willingness to broach the subject of climate change and germany 's own stance on the environment may hint at tense discussions on the topic at some point in his future dealings with the us . the foreign minister also said he would raise the issue of clandestine stopovers at european airports by cia planes allegedly carrying terror suspects to secret prison camps while in washington .
it is a subject that steinmeier will almost certainly direct at white house national security adviser stephen hadley when the two meet later on tuesday and one which is likely to become more sensitive as eu investigations into the flights intensify . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? europe -pipe- 29.11.2005 europe facing environmental disaster through global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice caps in the north could push europeans into the center of the continent europe is facing the worst climate change in five millennia as a result of global warming , the european environment agency warned in a report issued tuesday as the un 's summit on climate control entered its second day . europe 's four hottest years on record were 1998 , 2002 , 2003 and 2004 , the agency said . " ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .
rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

" on the back of the reports , the us-based independent watchdog human rights watch also said it was " practically convinced " of the existence of such centers in poland and romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner , franco frattini " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said .
this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government . awaiting white house response the justice commissioner added that although the eu had made contact with washington several days earlier to get to the bottom of the allegations , brussels had so far received no " formal assurance " of the reports being untrue . the state department said on monday that it had received inquiries from europe concerning the press reports , and would be willing to answer any queries " in as complete and forthright manner " as possible when secretary of state condoleezza rice visits europe next week . the us secretary of state will also be expected to respond to reports that the cia tortured terror suspects during flights in european airspace .

but he gave no indication whether she would go beyond the us administration 's line , neither confirming nor denying the existence of the interrogation centers , but defending the us stance on the continued war against terror . " i think the conversation will take place in the broader context of our common struggle against terrorism , " he said . investigations underway the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly had already announced a probe into reports of the cia operating clandestine prisons in some european countries , and many eu countries including finland , italy , poland , romania and spain have opened their own investigations into the allegations of aviation aircraft stopovers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier germany has launched an investigation into a case in which an egyptian suspect was transported via ramstein , the largest us airbase on european soil , to egypt where his supporters say he was tortured . the new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , is under domestic political pressure to raise the issue in washington on tuesday when he holds his first meeting with rice since taking up office earlier this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .
" perhaps we have our own special connections .

she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.11.2005 germany 's new man abroad faces early transatlantic test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will face few tasks tougher than negotiating with the us frank-walter steinmeier meets with white house officials including secretary of state condoleezza rice on tuesday .
while the new foreign minister hopes for better ties with the us , it could still be a baptism of fire . it is one of the hottest " hot potatoes " that frank-walter steinmeier is ever likely to juggle in his new role as germany 's foreign minister .
while european squabbles may prove to be the cause for many a future headache , germany 's new man abroad will find few tasks as complex and potentially combustible as dealing with the united states . steinmeier debuted in washington on monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan but the main event will be on tuesday when germany ’ s chief diplomat will hold talks with his counterpart , us secretary of state condoleezza rice . while steinmeier 's predecessor may privately lament his tenure as foreign minister being cut short by germany 's september general election and the subsequent formation of a christian union-social democrat coalition , joschka fischer is unlikely to miss sparring with the likes of messrs. cheney , powell and rumsfeld . during fischer 's seven years in the foreign office , german-us relations hit an all-time low as a direct result of gerhard schröder 's militant stand against the invasion of iraq .
while schröder took regular and uncompromising flak for his stance from across the atlantic , the former chancellor very rarely had to deal with the abuse face to face .
fischer was the man who was charged with butting heads with the state department and the white house . iraq remains the main contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's staunch opposition to the iraq war still sticks in the craw despite the icy chill somewhat thawing between the two nations of late , frank-walter steinmeier will now be that point man .
while some of the personnel may have changed - rice having taken over from colin powell - the main topic remains the same : iraq . before even being sworn in , steinmeier had set out his stall on the subject that had come so very close to irrevocably damaging transatlantic relations during the summer of 2002 .
earlier this month , steinmeier responded to reports that the us had requested that germany expands its activities in iraq by ruling out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly in the war-ravaged nation . however , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship would one of the two main pillars of german foreign policy along with european integration . loyalty to schröder may rankle in washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's loyalty to his former boss could alienate some in the us while this could mean that there will be no new spats over german involvement in iraq , steinmeier will be charged with keeping a lid on old problems which could be just as challenging as avoiding new ones . a staunch supporter of the ex-chancellor and formerly schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier is a social democrat foreign minister who strongly supported his former boss ' stand against the us .
this may rub some old foes in washington the wrong way despite his arrival with olive branch in hand . if steinmeier can steer a smooth course on iraq during his meeting with rice , there are other potential storms which could blow their embryonic working relationship off course . carrying on fischer 's project of diplomacy with iran the topic of iran 's nuclear ambitions may provoke a difference of opinion as steinmeier takes over the diplomatic torch from fischer as part of the eu-3 negotiating team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice has often made her suspicions of the eu-3 public rice has been suspicious of the europeans ' efforts to resolve the crisis diplomatically and recently reiterated us willingness to bring tehran before the un security council .
while germany has led with , albeit thinning , patience , the united states has , on the whole , been more in favor of sanctions sooner rather than later . environment issues and cia bases lie in wait the new foreign minister , who revealed before his visit that he wanted to address climate issues as well , may also be faced with a backlash brought on from comments by jürgen trittin , the former environment minister , who caused outrage with " reap what you sow " statements in the aftermath of the destruction meted out on the us by hurricane katrina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could urge the us to do more to address climate change while steinmeier will undoubtedly take a more diplomatic approach , his willingness to broach the subject of climate change and germany 's own stance on the environment may hint at tense discussions on the topic at some point in his future dealings with the us . the foreign minister also said he would raise the issue of clandestine stopovers at european airports by cia planes allegedly carrying terror suspects to secret prison camps while in washington .
it is a subject that steinmeier will almost certainly direct at white house national security adviser stephen hadley when the two meet later on tuesday and one which is likely to become more sensitive as eu investigations into the flights intensify . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .
another click takes you to a form where you can provide your account details for a bank transfer .
when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .
bildunterschrift : potentially worth 300,000 euros not a field of flowers still , the publicity the organization gains from the campaign is at least as important as the money .
parts of zizka 's minefield has been exhibited in the rotterdam art hall , frankfurt 's schauspielhaus theater and in the german foreign office in berlin , the aim being to reach as many people as possible .
only after a second glance , does one recognize that the different-sized discs scattered on the warm beige background are n't just part of an aesthetically pleasing floor covering .
" it almost looks like a field of flowers , " said zizka .
" in the foreign office , one of the gentlemen who works there came and said , ' ah , you 're making christmas decorations ? " ' the next stop in the minefield 's tour will be the nobel museum in oslo , but part of it will already have been cleared by then .
the plates sold to donors will have been sent to the people who paid for their removal . mathias bölinger -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making afghan children smile founded in kabul , the mobile mini circus for children are bringing their show to audiences in germany and denmark .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .

while the new foreign minister hopes for better ties with the us , it could still be a baptism of fire . it is one of the hottest " hot potatoes " that frank-walter steinmeier is ever likely to juggle in his new role as germany 's foreign minister .
while european squabbles may prove to be the cause for many a future headache , germany 's new man abroad will find few tasks as complex and potentially combustible as dealing with the united states . steinmeier debuted in washington on monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan but the main event will be on tuesday when germany ’ s chief diplomat will hold talks with his counterpart , us secretary of state condoleezza rice . while steinmeier 's predecessor may privately lament his tenure as foreign minister being cut short by germany 's september general election and the subsequent formation of a christian union-social democrat coalition , joschka fischer is unlikely to miss sparring with the likes of messrs. cheney , powell and rumsfeld . during fischer 's seven years in the foreign office , german-us relations hit an all-time low as a direct result of gerhard schröder 's militant stand against the invasion of iraq .
while schröder took regular and uncompromising flak for his stance from across the atlantic , the former chancellor very rarely had to deal with the abuse face to face .

while some of the personnel may have changed - rice having taken over from colin powell - the main topic remains the same : iraq . before even being sworn in , steinmeier had set out his stall on the subject that had come so very close to irrevocably damaging transatlantic relations during the summer of 2002 .
earlier this month , steinmeier responded to reports that the us had requested that germany expands its activities in iraq by ruling out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly in the war-ravaged nation . however , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship would one of the two main pillars of german foreign policy along with european integration . loyalty to schröder may rankle in washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's loyalty to his former boss could alienate some in the us while this could mean that there will be no new spats over german involvement in iraq , steinmeier will be charged with keeping a lid on old problems which could be just as challenging as avoiding new ones . a staunch supporter of the ex-chancellor and formerly schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier is a social democrat foreign minister who strongly supported his former boss ' stand against the us .
this may rub some old foes in washington the wrong way despite his arrival with olive branch in hand . if steinmeier can steer a smooth course on iraq during his meeting with rice , there are other potential storms which could blow their embryonic working relationship off course . carrying on fischer 's project of diplomacy with iran the topic of iran 's nuclear ambitions may provoke a difference of opinion as steinmeier takes over the diplomatic torch from fischer as part of the eu-3 negotiating team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice has often made her suspicions of the eu-3 public rice has been suspicious of the europeans ' efforts to resolve the crisis diplomatically and recently reiterated us willingness to bring tehran before the un security council .
while germany has led with , albeit thinning , patience , the united states has , on the whole , been more in favor of sanctions sooner rather than later . environment issues and cia bases lie in wait the new foreign minister , who revealed before his visit that he wanted to address climate issues as well , may also be faced with a backlash brought on from comments by jürgen trittin , the former environment minister , who caused outrage with " reap what you sow " statements in the aftermath of the destruction meted out on the us by hurricane katrina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could urge the us to do more to address climate change while steinmeier will undoubtedly take a more diplomatic approach , his willingness to broach the subject of climate change and germany 's own stance on the environment may hint at tense discussions on the topic at some point in his future dealings with the us . the foreign minister also said he would raise the issue of clandestine stopovers at european airports by cia planes allegedly carrying terror suspects to secret prison camps while in washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? europe -pipe- 29.11.2005 europe facing environmental disaster through global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice caps in the north could push europeans into the center of the continent europe is facing the worst climate change in five millennia as a result of global warming , the european environment agency warned in a report issued tuesday as the un 's summit on climate control entered its second day . europe 's four hottest years on record were 1998 , 2002 , 2003 and 2004 , the agency said . " ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .
rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .
rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.11.2005 art against land mines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zizka 's virtual minefield looks like 1950s linoleum from afar despite the international ban on land mines , many countries continue to lay the explosives .
a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .
another click takes you to a form where you can provide your account details for a bank transfer .
when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .
bildunterschrift : potentially worth 300,000 euros not a field of flowers still , the publicity the organization gains from the campaign is at least as important as the money .
parts of zizka 's minefield has been exhibited in the rotterdam art hall , frankfurt 's schauspielhaus theater and in the german foreign office in berlin , the aim being to reach as many people as possible .
only after a second glance , does one recognize that the different-sized discs scattered on the warm beige background are n't just part of an aesthetically pleasing floor covering .
" it almost looks like a field of flowers , " said zizka .
" in the foreign office , one of the gentlemen who works there came and said , ' ah , you 're making christmas decorations ? " ' the next stop in the minefield 's tour will be the nobel museum in oslo , but part of it will already have been cleared by then .
the plates sold to donors will have been sent to the people who paid for their removal . mathias bölinger -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making afghan children smile founded in kabul , the mobile mini circus for children are bringing their show to audiences in germany and denmark .

a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .

when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .
bildunterschrift : potentially worth 300,000 euros not a field of flowers still , the publicity the organization gains from the campaign is at least as important as the money .
parts of zizka 's minefield has been exhibited in the rotterdam art hall , frankfurt 's schauspielhaus theater and in the german foreign office in berlin , the aim being to reach as many people as possible .
only after a second glance , does one recognize that the different-sized discs scattered on the warm beige background are n't just part of an aesthetically pleasing floor covering .
" it almost looks like a field of flowers , " said zizka .
" in the foreign office , one of the gentlemen who works there came and said , ' ah , you 're making christmas decorations ? " ' the next stop in the minefield 's tour will be the nobel museum in oslo , but part of it will already have been cleared by then .

" on the back of the reports , the us-based independent watchdog human rights watch also said it was " practically convinced " of the existence of such centers in poland and romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner , franco frattini " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said .
this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government . awaiting white house response the justice commissioner added that although the eu had made contact with washington several days earlier to get to the bottom of the allegations , brussels had so far received no " formal assurance " of the reports being untrue . the state department said on monday that it had received inquiries from europe concerning the press reports , and would be willing to answer any queries " in as complete and forthright manner " as possible when secretary of state condoleezza rice visits europe next week . the us secretary of state will also be expected to respond to reports that the cia tortured terror suspects during flights in european airspace .

but he gave no indication whether she would go beyond the us administration 's line , neither confirming nor denying the existence of the interrogation centers , but defending the us stance on the continued war against terror . " i think the conversation will take place in the broader context of our common struggle against terrorism , " he said . investigations underway the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly had already announced a probe into reports of the cia operating clandestine prisons in some european countries , and many eu countries including finland , italy , poland , romania and spain have opened their own investigations into the allegations of aviation aircraft stopovers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier germany has launched an investigation into a case in which an egyptian suspect was transported via ramstein , the largest us airbase on european soil , to egypt where his supporters say he was tortured . the new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , is under domestic political pressure to raise the issue in washington on tuesday when he holds his first meeting with rice since taking up office earlier this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? europe -pipe- 29.11.2005 europe facing environmental disaster through global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice caps in the north could push europeans into the center of the continent europe is facing the worst climate change in five millennia as a result of global warming , the european environment agency warned in a report issued tuesday as the un 's summit on climate control entered its second day . europe 's four hottest years on record were 1998 , 2002 , 2003 and 2004 , the agency said . " ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .

but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .
" perhaps we have our own special connections .

a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .
another click takes you to a form where you can provide your account details for a bank transfer .
when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .
bildunterschrift : potentially worth 300,000 euros not a field of flowers still , the publicity the organization gains from the campaign is at least as important as the money .
parts of zizka 's minefield has been exhibited in the rotterdam art hall , frankfurt 's schauspielhaus theater and in the german foreign office in berlin , the aim being to reach as many people as possible .
only after a second glance , does one recognize that the different-sized discs scattered on the warm beige background are n't just part of an aesthetically pleasing floor covering .
" it almost looks like a field of flowers , " said zizka .
" in the foreign office , one of the gentlemen who works there came and said , ' ah , you 're making christmas decorations ? " ' the next stop in the minefield 's tour will be the nobel museum in oslo , but part of it will already have been cleared by then .

" on the back of the reports , the us-based independent watchdog human rights watch also said it was " practically convinced " of the existence of such centers in poland and romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner , franco frattini " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said .
this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government . awaiting white house response the justice commissioner added that although the eu had made contact with washington several days earlier to get to the bottom of the allegations , brussels had so far received no " formal assurance " of the reports being untrue . the state department said on monday that it had received inquiries from europe concerning the press reports , and would be willing to answer any queries " in as complete and forthright manner " as possible when secretary of state condoleezza rice visits europe next week . the us secretary of state will also be expected to respond to reports that the cia tortured terror suspects during flights in european airspace .

but he gave no indication whether she would go beyond the us administration 's line , neither confirming nor denying the existence of the interrogation centers , but defending the us stance on the continued war against terror . " i think the conversation will take place in the broader context of our common struggle against terrorism , " he said . investigations underway the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly had already announced a probe into reports of the cia operating clandestine prisons in some european countries , and many eu countries including finland , italy , poland , romania and spain have opened their own investigations into the allegations of aviation aircraft stopovers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier germany has launched an investigation into a case in which an egyptian suspect was transported via ramstein , the largest us airbase on european soil , to egypt where his supporters say he was tortured . the new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , is under domestic political pressure to raise the issue in washington on tuesday when he holds his first meeting with rice since taking up office earlier this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .
" perhaps we have our own special connections .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .
rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.11.2005 germany 's new man abroad faces early transatlantic test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will face few tasks tougher than negotiating with the us frank-walter steinmeier meets with white house officials including secretary of state condoleezza rice on tuesday .
while the new foreign minister hopes for better ties with the us , it could still be a baptism of fire . it is one of the hottest " hot potatoes " that frank-walter steinmeier is ever likely to juggle in his new role as germany 's foreign minister .
while european squabbles may prove to be the cause for many a future headache , germany 's new man abroad will find few tasks as complex and potentially combustible as dealing with the united states . steinmeier debuted in washington on monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan but the main event will be on tuesday when germany ’ s chief diplomat will hold talks with his counterpart , us secretary of state condoleezza rice . while steinmeier 's predecessor may privately lament his tenure as foreign minister being cut short by germany 's september general election and the subsequent formation of a christian union-social democrat coalition , joschka fischer is unlikely to miss sparring with the likes of messrs. cheney , powell and rumsfeld . during fischer 's seven years in the foreign office , german-us relations hit an all-time low as a direct result of gerhard schröder 's militant stand against the invasion of iraq .
while schröder took regular and uncompromising flak for his stance from across the atlantic , the former chancellor very rarely had to deal with the abuse face to face .
fischer was the man who was charged with butting heads with the state department and the white house . iraq remains the main contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's staunch opposition to the iraq war still sticks in the craw despite the icy chill somewhat thawing between the two nations of late , frank-walter steinmeier will now be that point man .
while some of the personnel may have changed - rice having taken over from colin powell - the main topic remains the same : iraq . before even being sworn in , steinmeier had set out his stall on the subject that had come so very close to irrevocably damaging transatlantic relations during the summer of 2002 .
earlier this month , steinmeier responded to reports that the us had requested that germany expands its activities in iraq by ruling out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly in the war-ravaged nation . however , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship would one of the two main pillars of german foreign policy along with european integration . loyalty to schröder may rankle in washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's loyalty to his former boss could alienate some in the us while this could mean that there will be no new spats over german involvement in iraq , steinmeier will be charged with keeping a lid on old problems which could be just as challenging as avoiding new ones . a staunch supporter of the ex-chancellor and formerly schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier is a social democrat foreign minister who strongly supported his former boss ' stand against the us .
this may rub some old foes in washington the wrong way despite his arrival with olive branch in hand . if steinmeier can steer a smooth course on iraq during his meeting with rice , there are other potential storms which could blow their embryonic working relationship off course . carrying on fischer 's project of diplomacy with iran the topic of iran 's nuclear ambitions may provoke a difference of opinion as steinmeier takes over the diplomatic torch from fischer as part of the eu-3 negotiating team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice has often made her suspicions of the eu-3 public rice has been suspicious of the europeans ' efforts to resolve the crisis diplomatically and recently reiterated us willingness to bring tehran before the un security council .
while germany has led with , albeit thinning , patience , the united states has , on the whole , been more in favor of sanctions sooner rather than later . environment issues and cia bases lie in wait the new foreign minister , who revealed before his visit that he wanted to address climate issues as well , may also be faced with a backlash brought on from comments by jürgen trittin , the former environment minister , who caused outrage with " reap what you sow " statements in the aftermath of the destruction meted out on the us by hurricane katrina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could urge the us to do more to address climate change while steinmeier will undoubtedly take a more diplomatic approach , his willingness to broach the subject of climate change and germany 's own stance on the environment may hint at tense discussions on the topic at some point in his future dealings with the us . the foreign minister also said he would raise the issue of clandestine stopovers at european airports by cia planes allegedly carrying terror suspects to secret prison camps while in washington .
it is a subject that steinmeier will almost certainly direct at white house national security adviser stephen hadley when the two meet later on tuesday and one which is likely to become more sensitive as eu investigations into the flights intensify . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .
" some letters just make you laugh , like the one where a girl wrote that the little sister she had wished for a year ago , and gotten , would be picked up again . " anniversary the christmas child office in engelskirchen is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year .
before then , the german postal service would forward occasional letters to the christmas child without addresses to the engelskirchen post office , probably because of the town 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child office in engelskirchen there , an employee would generally read them and answer one or two .
over time however , an official service developed and just last year , 70,000 letters with christmas wishes made their way to the town . it 's not only children who write , but often retirees and people in prison .
for them , even though they no longer believe in the christmas child , they delight in simply knowing that someone is reading their letters and will send a response . most letters , however , come from children between the ages of seven and twelve and are often decorated with stickers , drawings or pictures cut out of catalogues , just so the christmas child is very clear exactly what present is wanted . but teenagers also write sometimes , says birgit müller , although toys are generally not on their mind - love is . " teenagers will write , for example , that we should try and get the object of their affection to notice them , " she said .
" perhaps we have our own special connections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany what can the world expect post-kyoto ? europe -pipe- 29.11.2005 europe facing environmental disaster through global warming großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting ice caps in the north could push europeans into the center of the continent europe is facing the worst climate change in five millennia as a result of global warming , the european environment agency warned in a report issued tuesday as the un 's summit on climate control entered its second day . europe 's four hottest years on record were 1998 , 2002 , 2003 and 2004 , the agency said . " ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .

but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .

" on the back of the reports , the us-based independent watchdog human rights watch also said it was " practically convinced " of the existence of such centers in poland and romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice commissioner , franco frattini " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said .

" i think the conversation will take place in the broader context of our common struggle against terrorism , " he said . investigations underway the council of europe 's parliamentary assembly had already announced a probe into reports of the cia operating clandestine prisons in some european countries , and many eu countries including finland , italy , poland , romania and spain have opened their own investigations into the allegations of aviation aircraft stopovers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier germany has launched an investigation into a case in which an egyptian suspect was transported via ramstein , the largest us airbase on european soil , to egypt where his supporters say he was tortured . the new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , is under domestic political pressure to raise the issue in washington on tuesday when he holds his first meeting with rice since taking up office earlier this month . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .
rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen . as the weather turns colder in germany and the days grow shorter , children 's thoughts often turn to christmas and the gifts they hope to receive .
already pens and pencils are being applied to paper and lists are being made to make sure the christmas child is clear about what she should bring on december 24 . for two decades now , letters addressed to the german bringer of presents have gone to a small town in western germany , engelskirchen .
-lrb- appropriately enough , since the town 's name means ' angel 's church ' -rrb- .
there , the letters are read and senders receive an answer , although the post office there is not responsible for actually procuring the gifts . " a barbie castle , a stuffed animal , barbie and princes … " reads five-year-old lara 's letter , which arrived in engelskirchen recently .
but she really wants the christmas child to stay at her house overnight this year . christmas child tradition that particular wish is not likely to be fulfilled , since the fictional christmas child is somewhat analogous to the equally fictional american santa claus or the british father christmas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas child at the opening of the nuremberg christmas market according to tradition , the christmas child , often portrayed as a young , female angel , comes to children 's homes , always unseen since the wee ones are either in another room or away from the house .
she decorates the tree and leaves presents before slipping away again . letters to the christmas child arrive in engelskirchen not only from germany , they also come from as far away as japan , australia , china , brazil and russia and start showing up as early as summer .
the mailbox is emptied daily and ten local housewives go through the letters . " dear christmas child : i want a little sister so bad , but my parents have said we wo n't get one .
i would also be very happy to get a pet , either a dog or a guinea pig .
and please let it really snow at christmas this year , so we can go sledding , " wrote little maren this year . even if the letter writers do n't get a personal answer , their notes do get read and those with return addresses get a christmas child form letter response .
she thanks the sender for writing , tells a little about her work and reminds children that they do n't always get everything they wish for . wish trends birgit müller , one of the women who reads the letters , is always in the know when it comes to the toys that companies have released during the year , since the whole spectrum is reflected in the children 's letters .
but she says this year there has been a trend away from computer games and toward real , hands-on toys , such as legos , dolls , trucks , bicycles and inline skates . but the letters are not just full of desires for material things , müller says .
many children write in saying they would like all children to have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear . " there are letters that kids really empty their hearts , and write for example that they want mommy and daddy to get back together again , " she said .

" ten percent of alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone , " the report said .
" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .
negotiations are expected to last several years . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on climate change read a selection dw-world articles on the ups and downs of establishing an effective global climate policy and the long road ahead .

but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .

a german artist has found a way to use his work for removing them . theater-goers at the german premier of us composer philip glass ' opera " civil wars " in freiburg last year sipped their champagne while traipsing across a minefield .
commissioned by the city 's stadttheater for the building 's foyer , the installation was the work of artist peter zizka . the work got zizka to thinking about how he could take it further .
finally , he contacted aid organization medico international with a unique proposal : he suggested his minefield become part of a traveling exhibition and the individual mines be sold in exchange for donations for the removal of the explosives . now the 600 plates that make up zizka 's minefield can be viewed on medico 's german web site .
intertested parties can help clear the mines by clicking on one of the 600 plates , each of which cost a 500-euro -lrb- $ 590 -rrb- donation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clearing landmines in sri lanka clicking on a mine leads you first to information about the group that would benefit from you donating for that particular plate .
another click takes you to a form where you can provide your account details for a bank transfer .
when medico receives the money , the land mine plate is stamped with the word " geräumt , " or cleared , on the web site .
buy a landmine , help an amputee almost half of the plates have been sold so far , according to medico 's thomas gebauer .
and both of the project 's aims have nearly been reached : " first , naturally raising awareness among the population that mine problems have by no means been solved with the signature of the ottawa treaty -lrb- that bans land mines -rrb- , and we 've collected 150,000 euros , " gebauer said . the donations go to organizations that remove land mines , raise awareness in countries where mines are a danger and help victims , such as the afghan group amputee bicyclists for rehabilitation and recreation , a prosthesis workshop in el salvador or the cambodian volleyball league for the handicapped . but the money can only contribute a small part to the actual cost of removing an anti-personnel mine , which costs up to $ 1,000 -lrb- 850 euros -rrb- , according to united nations .
in angola , where an estimated 10 million mines have been laid , up to $ 10 billion would be necessary to clear the whole country .
medico would have to sell 30,000 minefields .
bildunterschrift : potentially worth 300,000 euros not a field of flowers still , the publicity the organization gains from the campaign is at least as important as the money .
parts of zizka 's minefield has been exhibited in the rotterdam art hall , frankfurt 's schauspielhaus theater and in the german foreign office in berlin , the aim being to reach as many people as possible .
only after a second glance , does one recognize that the different-sized discs scattered on the warm beige background are n't just part of an aesthetically pleasing floor covering .

" at current rates , three-quarters of switzerland 's glaciers will have melted by 2050 .
europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5,000 years . " the report was issued at the agency 's headquarters in copenhagen , coinciding with the first full day of debate at key un talks on curbing the greenhouse gases that stoke global warming . in the 20th century , the average global temperature rose 0.7 c -lrb- 1.25 f -rrb- as a result of burning coal , gas and coal - the carbon fuels that are mainly to blame for the rise .
but the rise in europe was 0.95 c -lrb- 1.71 f -rrb- , 35 percent higher , because of the continent 's vulnerable location and smaller land mass , the eaa said . " without effective action over several decades , global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south .
the continent 's population could effectively be concentrated in the centre , " eaa executive director jacqueline mcglade said . the european union is striving to limit the overall global rise in temperature to 2 c -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- by implementing the un 's kyoto protocol on greenhouse-gas pollution and encouraging the use of cleaner resources . conditions " never experienced by humans " but mcglade warned : " even if we constrain global warming to the eu target of a two-degree -lrb- celsius -rrb- increase , we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced .
deeper cuts in emissions are needed . " the report , " the european environment - state and outlook 2005 , " is an assessment of environmental quality in 31 countries that is published every five years . global warming is listed as one challenge , alongside preserving biodiversity and marine ecosystems , land and water resources and tackling air pollution . the 12-day montreal talks , which opened monday , gather signatories of the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , kyoto 's parent treaty . their main task is to take the first steps towards deciding how to shape commitments for reducing greenhouse gases after the present " commitment period " under the protocol runs out in 2012 . in its present format , kyoto requires only industrialized ratifying countries to make target reductions in the pollution .
but it does not include the biggest polluter , the united states , which walked out of the pact in 2001 , nor china and india , which are now big emitters of carbon dioxide , included in the reductions targets . apocalyptic peril bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some compare problems caused by greenhouse gases to weapons of mass destruction meanwhile at the montreal summit , lord may , the president of britain 's leading scientific body , the royal society , warned that global warming was an apocalyptic peril whose effects are already visible .
" the impacts of global warming are many and serious , " may said in an advance copy of his speech released monday , adding that the environmental problems wrought by greenhouse gases " invite comparison with weapons of mass destruction . " evironmental groups greenpeace and friends of the earth warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast .
" extreme weather events , drought and rising sea levels threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world .
negotiators must remember this as they enter these talks , " said catherine pearce of friends of the earth international . greenpeace campaigner steve sawyer said the meeting urgently had to give a sign that binding caps would remain post-2012 , otherwise the world 's fledgling market in carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions could be wrecked .
europe already behind un representative richard kinley urged industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming . but meeting the demands of the kyoto protocol is apparently a massive challenge , especially for europe .
the eu is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent by 2012 .
but the european environment agency has warned that at least 15 major eu countries are only likely to achieve a drop of 2.5 percent .
a report on europe 's environmental condition indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have actually been rising since 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is n't bound by kyoto it 's not just industrialized giants that are causing concern .
experts pointed out that developing countries like china and india will now have to contribute to anti-pollution controls .
the two are not currently bound by the kyoto protocol . the montreal meeting is the first by the convention since the kyoto protocol , signed by 156 countries , took effect in february .
the pact commits industrialized nations to making specific cuts in carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases that trap solar heat , thus warming the planet 's surface and disrupting its delicate climate system .
success limited without us but the present commitment period does not include the planet 's worst polluter , the united states , which walked away from the protocol in 2001 because of the high cost of meeting its kyoto targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ozone layer continues getting thinner the present kyoto period is only just a tiny first step towards tackling greenhouse gases that have increased dramatically in recent decades as fossil fuels are burned to power economic growth . atmospheric co2 levels are now at the highest in 650,000 years , scientists say , and 2005 is likely to go into history books as the warmest year on record . for post-2012 kyoto to make serious inroads into this pollution , it would have to include the united states and big developing countries .
but finding a format that bridges this gulf of interests is a huge task .

but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.11.2005 germany 's new man abroad faces early transatlantic test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will face few tasks tougher than negotiating with the us frank-walter steinmeier meets with white house officials including secretary of state condoleezza rice on tuesday .
while the new foreign minister hopes for better ties with the us , it could still be a baptism of fire . it is one of the hottest " hot potatoes " that frank-walter steinmeier is ever likely to juggle in his new role as germany 's foreign minister .
while european squabbles may prove to be the cause for many a future headache , germany 's new man abroad will find few tasks as complex and potentially combustible as dealing with the united states . steinmeier debuted in washington on monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan but the main event will be on tuesday when germany ’ s chief diplomat will hold talks with his counterpart , us secretary of state condoleezza rice . while steinmeier 's predecessor may privately lament his tenure as foreign minister being cut short by germany 's september general election and the subsequent formation of a christian union-social democrat coalition , joschka fischer is unlikely to miss sparring with the likes of messrs. cheney , powell and rumsfeld . during fischer 's seven years in the foreign office , german-us relations hit an all-time low as a direct result of gerhard schröder 's militant stand against the invasion of iraq .
while schröder took regular and uncompromising flak for his stance from across the atlantic , the former chancellor very rarely had to deal with the abuse face to face .
fischer was the man who was charged with butting heads with the state department and the white house . iraq remains the main contentious issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's staunch opposition to the iraq war still sticks in the craw despite the icy chill somewhat thawing between the two nations of late , frank-walter steinmeier will now be that point man .
while some of the personnel may have changed - rice having taken over from colin powell - the main topic remains the same : iraq . before even being sworn in , steinmeier had set out his stall on the subject that had come so very close to irrevocably damaging transatlantic relations during the summer of 2002 .
earlier this month , steinmeier responded to reports that the us had requested that germany expands its activities in iraq by ruling out any major foreign policy changes in transatlantic ties , particularly in the war-ravaged nation . however , steinmeier announced that he would undertake efforts to further improve relations with the us .
" to do nothing would surely not be good advice , " said steinmeier , pointing out the social democrats and conservatives had made it clear in their coalition deal that the transatlantic relationship would one of the two main pillars of german foreign policy along with european integration . loyalty to schröder may rankle in washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's loyalty to his former boss could alienate some in the us while this could mean that there will be no new spats over german involvement in iraq , steinmeier will be charged with keeping a lid on old problems which could be just as challenging as avoiding new ones . a staunch supporter of the ex-chancellor and formerly schröder 's chief of staff , steinmeier is a social democrat foreign minister who strongly supported his former boss ' stand against the us .
this may rub some old foes in washington the wrong way despite his arrival with olive branch in hand . if steinmeier can steer a smooth course on iraq during his meeting with rice , there are other potential storms which could blow their embryonic working relationship off course . carrying on fischer 's project of diplomacy with iran the topic of iran 's nuclear ambitions may provoke a difference of opinion as steinmeier takes over the diplomatic torch from fischer as part of the eu-3 negotiating team . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice has often made her suspicions of the eu-3 public rice has been suspicious of the europeans ' efforts to resolve the crisis diplomatically and recently reiterated us willingness to bring tehran before the un security council .
while germany has led with , albeit thinning , patience , the united states has , on the whole , been more in favor of sanctions sooner rather than later . environment issues and cia bases lie in wait the new foreign minister , who revealed before his visit that he wanted to address climate issues as well , may also be faced with a backlash brought on from comments by jürgen trittin , the former environment minister , who caused outrage with " reap what you sow " statements in the aftermath of the destruction meted out on the us by hurricane katrina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could urge the us to do more to address climate change while steinmeier will undoubtedly take a more diplomatic approach , his willingness to broach the subject of climate change and germany 's own stance on the environment may hint at tense discussions on the topic at some point in his future dealings with the us . the foreign minister also said he would raise the issue of clandestine stopovers at european airports by cia planes allegedly carrying terror suspects to secret prison camps while in washington .
it is a subject that steinmeier will almost certainly direct at white house national security adviser stephen hadley when the two meet later on tuesday and one which is likely to become more sensitive as eu investigations into the flights intensify . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

the country 's senior electoral official declared opposition candidate manuel zelaya the winner , even though only 1 % of votes had been counted .
his opponent , porfirio lobo , decried the announcement , demanding that every ballot be tallied .
outgoing president ricardo maduro has asked both candidates for restraint .
" we have a president-elect , " aristides mejia , the head of the country 's electoral tribunal , told reuters on monday .
" i believe the difference is clear and conclusive . "
mr lobo , from the ruling party , has refused to admit defeat mr zelaya promptly claimed victory , and his supporters broke into celebrations , with singing and dancing at his liberal party 's campaign headquarters .
however results giving mr zelaya 50 % of the vote to mr lobo 's 45 % were only gathered from a small number of polling stations .
other officials cautioned that the full results may take days or weeks to come in .
mr lobo refused to accept defeat .
" i 'm going to defend the right of my people to have their votes counted , " he said .
sunday 's vote was the seventh presidential election since 1981 , when civilian rule was restored .
violence both right-wing leading candidates , who were neck-and-neck going into the polls , vowed to cut crime in honduras , which is wracked by gang violence , 30 % unemployment and poverty .
mr lobo , 57 , is a former communist who has pledged to introduce the death penalty for crimes such as sexual assault , kidnapping and murder .
mr zelaya , 53 , is a civil engineer and rancher who has previously served as investment minister , and wants to maintain life sentences for the worst offences while doubling police on the streets .
the three other candidates who contested the election were not expected to draw widespread support .
elections guide how latin america 's political landscape could be redrawn mr lobo worked alongside current president ricardo maduro , a national party colleague , to introduce penal code reform that has criminalised gang membership .
but there has been little let-up in the violence , with at least 45,000 gang members estimated to be operating inside honduras .
the gangs grew out of los angeles and have become a fixture of life in honduras .
the most notorious group , the mara salvatrucha , is blamed for a bus massacre that killed 28 people in late 2004 .
an estimated four million registered honduran voters have also elected 298 mayors and 128 deputies to the single-chamber congress .

the village became known worldwide as the site of the classic 1960s series .
sky plans a new run inspired by the original , which starred patrick mcgoohan as a trapped ex-secret agent .
roger langley , of appreciation society six of one , said it was difficult to imagine it being set anywhere else .
the prisoner ran for only 17 episodes on itv from 1967 , but inspires fanatical devotion and helps attracts some of the village 's 250,000 annual visitors .
in the series , patrick mcgoohan was unable to escape portmeirion , which was populated by a brainwashed population held captive by a mysterious regime .
the prisoners were known only by numbers and mcgoohan 's character was famously called number six .
there 's nowhere else like portmeirion on earth roger langley , six of one there were no bars or barbed wire , but massive balloons would smother anyone attempting to escape .
the series was shown in more than 60 countries throughout the world .
" it 's very disappointing news that they 've ruled it out at such an early stage , " said mr langley .
" most people who remember the prisoner remember that strange place where number six was and the landscape and architecture of portmeirion .
portmeirion facts portmeirion was built between 1926 - 1939 and 1954 - 1972 by clough williams-ellis the mcgoohan character in the prisoner famously declared : " i am not a number ; i am a free man " the finale of the itv hit show cold feet was filmed there in 2003 the village includes colourful cottages and examples of varying architectural styles " you ca n't duplicate the visual attraction .
you know it 's a real place - you felt you were there .
you could identify with the character being held there .
" there 's nowhere else like portmeirion on earth . "
the fan club is supporting the proposed remake , however .
" we want it to succeed .
if something as good as that can be made we would certainly welcome it . "
" but they probably wo n't get anywhere quite like portmeirion , " he added .
the portmeirion setting would hit the cutting room floor in the new series , according to broadcast magazine .
the producers of the new series said they were aiming for a " radical reinvention " of the series and intended to take " liberties with the original " .
but they said the themes of paranoia , conspiracy and identity crisis would remain .
a spokesman for sky one said it was too early to say for certain what would happen with the series , which was still in the commissioning stage .
in may , a plaque was unveiled in portmeirion by actress fenella fielding , who provided the unseen village voice , to honour the series .

running water was switched off to the city 's 3.8m people for five days after 100 tonnes of benzene spilled into the songhua river .
despite reassurances by city officials , some residents said they were still too nervous to drink the water .
communities further along the river are having to cut off their water supplies as the polluted slick moves downstream .
russia has warned the spill is heading towards its amur river , which feeds water to more than 500,000 residents of the khabarovsk region .
but officials say they expect pollution levels to be substantially lower than those in the songhua .
the water supply in harbin was switched back on on sunday .
for the previous five days , people had had to rely on bottled water and water delivered by lorries .
" harbin 's water is now safe to use and drink , " said xiu tinggong of the city 's health inspection bureau .
" everybody can rest assured that the water is safe . "
schools return but not everyone is convinced .
" we still ca n't be sure that it 's safe , " bank worker sun ning was quoted by the associated press as saying .
" it 's not that we do n't trust the government but we are still not totally at ease . "
and education chiefs have told schools to buy in " quality drinking water " or instruct the city 's 400,000 school children to take bottled water from home when they go back to school on wednesday .
meanwhile , downstream in yilan county , 30,000 people were to have their water supplies closed off four days .
the spillage was caused by an explosion on 13 november at a petrochemical plant upstream in jilin .
harbin 's water supply was cut off eight days later .
local government officials initially said it was for mains maintenance .
only after state media revealed the water could have been contaminated by the blast did the authorities admit very high levels of the highly poisonous toxin , which is also carcinogenic , had been found .
beijing pledged to hold an inquiry , as government credibility came into question .

communities further along the river are having to cut off their water supplies as the polluted slick moves downstream .
russia has warned the spill is heading towards its amur river , which feeds water to more than 500,000 residents of the khabarovsk region .
but officials say they expect pollution levels to be substantially lower than those in the songhua .
the water supply in harbin was switched back on on sunday .
for the previous five days , people had had to rely on bottled water and water delivered by lorries .
" harbin 's water is now safe to use and drink , " said xiu tinggong of the city 's health inspection bureau .
" everybody can rest assured that the water is safe . "
schools return but not everyone is convinced .
" we still ca n't be sure that it 's safe , " bank worker sun ning was quoted by the associated press as saying .
" it 's not that we do n't trust the government but we are still not totally at ease . "
and education chiefs have told schools to buy in " quality drinking water " or instruct the city 's 400,000 school children to take bottled water from home when they go back to school on wednesday .
meanwhile , downstream in yilan county , 30,000 people were to have their water supplies closed off four days .
the spillage was caused by an explosion on 13 november at a petrochemical plant upstream in jilin .
harbin 's water supply was cut off eight days later .
local government officials initially said it was for mains maintenance .
only after state media revealed the water could have been contaminated by the blast did the authorities admit very high levels of the highly poisonous toxin , which is also carcinogenic , had been found .
beijing pledged to hold an inquiry , as government credibility came into question .

the change has raised question marks over argentina 's continuing economic rehabilitation , and the main buenos aires share index dropped 4.5 % .
felisa miceli , president of the state-owned national bank of argentina , has been chosen to succeed mr lavagna .
analysts said political pressures had led to mr lavagna 's resignation .
time to change argentina 's president nestor kirchner decided to reshuffle his cabinet following last month 's elections which saw him pick up support .
as well as mr lavagna , foreign minister rafael bielsa , defence minister jose pampuro and social development minister alicia kirchner , the president 's sister , were also replaced .
according to reports , mr lavagna 's view of how the economy should be developed differed from that of president kirchner .
the financial times said that the president and minister had clashed over the way money was being spent on infrastructure projects .
the reuters news agency said president kirchner was also not keen to slow economic growth in order to rein in inflation , and wanted to boost wages to cut the gap between the poor and rich .
' very bad news ' the worry among analysts is that argentina may now be less willing to enforce tough spending measures .
" mr lavagna was one of the few members of the cabinet that seemed to have some understanding of the concerns and interests of investors , " said alberto bernal , an analyst at bear stearns .
" mr lavagna 's resignation is very bad news for the government , " he said .
appointed economy minister in 2002 , mr lavagna took over at a time when argentina was still struggling to recover from its debt default and currency devaluation at the end of 2001 .
a key part of his work was helping reschedule argentina 's $ 120bn -lrb- £ 70bn -rrb- in foreign debts .
" mr lavagna was well considered , that 's why his exit has affected the markets , " said noelia lucini , an analyst at capital markets argentina .
better times ?
argentina 's economy has been growing in recent years , though it is still saddled with massive debts .
growth this year is expected at close to 8 % , after expansion of 9 % in 2004 .
" the change of ministers at this time is very risky because the current minister has shown after several years that he is moderate and can help meet our objectives , as seen by the current economic conditions , " said miguel schiaritti , president of the argentine chamber of commerce .
as well as the decline on the benchmark merval stock index , argentina 's peso lost 1.3 % against the us dollar .
" there is a sensation that the market does n't like the change , " said hector blanco , a broker with abc mercado de cambio .
" it looks like a political choice rather than picking some one with the education and experience for such an important job , " he said .
analysts said the ms miceli , the ministry 's first female boss , faced a number of key challenges , including bringing down inflation and reaching new agreements with creditors such as the international monetary fund .

the national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- says hundreds of millions of tonnes of coal could still be retrieved from coastal areas of the region .
the north east 's last deep colliery at ellington , near ashington , closed earlier this year with 350 job losses .
a government review of britain 's energy policy is under way amid fears gas supplies may run short .
num chairman ian lavery said : " we can produce coal cheaply and burned with near zero emission levels , so why not begin production again ?
" basically , we have to understand that coal is a fuel of the future and not a fuel of the past .
clean technology " we have people all over the north east who would love to be working back down the pit . "
mr lavery questioned the long-term cost effectiveness of nuclear and gas import options being considered by the government .
he added : " i would suggest that the reopening of the coalfields and associated clean coal technology in power stations will produce electricity far cheaper than anything else that is currently being considered . "
mr lavery 's comments come as the price of wholesale gas has almost doubled during the past week , prompting fears about winter supplies to industry in the uk .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out an expansion of britain 's civil nuclear generating programme .

firefox 1.5 is due to be available for download on 29 november , marking the end of a thriving year for the browser .
analysts say firefox has grabbed a 10 % share of the browser market and it claims to have a core of 40-50 million dedicated users .
firefox maker mozilla is now planning more regular updates and to take swift action on security lapses .
engine overhaul the firefox web browser had its first birthday on 9 november 2005 and in the last 12 months has been downloaded by a huge number of web users .
in early november , it celebrated its 100 millionth download .
the last year has been phenomenal in terms of adoption , demand and the feedback we receive from a growing number of people chris beard , mozilla over the past 12 months , firefox has chipped away at the hold that microsoft 's internet explorer browser has over web users .
figures released in early november suggest it is now on 10 % of web users ' computers .
but microsoft 's internet explorer still leads the field with a global share of around 85 % .
firefox 's popularity has been helped by the fact that users can contribute to how it develops .
many have written extensions that add specific functions to the browser , such as a rss feed reader .
" the last year has been phenomenal in terms of adoption , demand and the feedback we receive from a growing number of people , " said chris beard , vice president of products at the mozilla corporation which oversees firefox development .
the mozilla foundation was started by browser maker netscape and it became a non-profit company in order to drive development of the software .
mr beard said the user base tended to be concentrated among the biggest users of the net but now mozilla was planning a push to get the software adopted by more consumers .
he said it was looking to work with net service firms and computer makers to get the browser in front of users who had not seen it before .
at the same time , it will step up efforts to spread the word about firefox and is seeking videos from fans of the ways they use the software .
many more websites were also tweaking their webpages to ensure they render properly .
mozilla will also put tools in the next release of the browser that let people report webpages that look strange when viewed via firefox .
at the same time mozilla is planning regular updates to firefox every six to nine months and to move quickly to close security loopholes .
the release of firefox 1.5 marks a big overhaul of the browsing " engine " inside the program , mr beard told the bbc news website .
