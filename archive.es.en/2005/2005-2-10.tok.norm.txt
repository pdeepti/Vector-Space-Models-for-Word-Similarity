10 - 20 , is now a must - along with cannes and venice .
it was n't always this way .
on the european scene , the milan-based film market , mifed , used to be stronger competition for berlin .
but when the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved its date from february to november , industry insiders heard the death knell for october 's mifed . according to the hollywood reporter , buyers felt the milan market offered a poor return .
the afm 's date swap has not only lent berlin a higher profile , it has also removed scheduling conflicts for buyers wanting to attend the berlinale 's sister event , the european film market . " i 'll be going to berlin for seven days , whereas in the past , i 'd only go if i had a film in the festival selection , " jean labadie , head of french distributor bac films told the hollywood reporter . star attraction more buyers might be winging their way to berlin this year , but what about the stars ?
after all , the number of big name celebrities in attendance is a key factor in a festival 's success .
there have been worries that the timing of the oscar nominations could result in fewer stars gracing the red carpet at the berlinale . in the past , oscar nominees were announced during the berlinale , making the festival a perfect stage for academy award-hopefuls .
last year , however , was the first year that the oscars took place a month earlier than usual .
the nominees , consequently , were announced earlier , and suddenly , high-voltage celebrities such as nicole kidman failed to show .
this year , though , promises to be different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter kosslick " there were people who were worrying about whether , after this thing with the oscars , anyone would come along , " berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a press conference , a big grin on his face . the reason ?
he 'd just finished reeling off a list of dozens of celebrities expected to crowd the main venue at potsdamer platz this year .
it included keanu reeves , will smith , kevin spacey , daniel day-lewis , catherine deneuve , joseph fiennes , glenn close , and gerard depardieu .
the glamor factor , it seems , is a sure thing . and yet , kosslick said he 's not even that concerned about the number of stars who come to berlin .
this year , hollywood films , he said , make up only two to three percent of the 343 films being screened .
in his view , the berlinale is a political film festival .
he cited the fact that 10 years after the genocide in rwanda , two of the competition films this year focus on what happened there . indeed , the berlinale has garnered a reputation among industry executives as a quality market , albeit a euro-centric one .
translated into hollywood-speak , that means it 's not the place to buy popular , blockbuster material .
but that does n't bother kosslick . " we do n't want to be the biggest festival in the world , because we already are , " he said , referring to the fact that the berlinale plays to the largest audience of any film festival in the world .

10 - 20 , is now a must - along with cannes and venice .
it was n't always this way .
on the european scene , the milan-based film market , mifed , used to be stronger competition for berlin .
but when the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved its date from february to november , industry insiders heard the death knell for october 's mifed . according to the hollywood reporter , buyers felt the milan market offered a poor return .
the afm 's date swap has not only lent berlin a higher profile , it has also removed scheduling conflicts for buyers wanting to attend the berlinale 's sister event , the european film market . " i 'll be going to berlin for seven days , whereas in the past , i 'd only go if i had a film in the festival selection , " jean labadie , head of french distributor bac films told the hollywood reporter . star attraction more buyers might be winging their way to berlin this year , but what about the stars ?
after all , the number of big name celebrities in attendance is a key factor in a festival 's success .
there have been worries that the timing of the oscar nominations could result in fewer stars gracing the red carpet at the berlinale . in the past , oscar nominees were announced during the berlinale , making the festival a perfect stage for academy award-hopefuls .
last year , however , was the first year that the oscars took place a month earlier than usual .
the nominees , consequently , were announced earlier , and suddenly , high-voltage celebrities such as nicole kidman failed to show .
this year , though , promises to be different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter kosslick " there were people who were worrying about whether , after this thing with the oscars , anyone would come along , " berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a press conference , a big grin on his face . the reason ?
he 'd just finished reeling off a list of dozens of celebrities expected to crowd the main venue at potsdamer platz this year .
it included keanu reeves , will smith , kevin spacey , daniel day-lewis , catherine deneuve , joseph fiennes , glenn close , and gerard depardieu .
the glamor factor , it seems , is a sure thing . and yet , kosslick said he 's not even that concerned about the number of stars who come to berlin .
this year , hollywood films , he said , make up only two to three percent of the 343 films being screened .
in his view , the berlinale is a political film festival .
he cited the fact that 10 years after the genocide in rwanda , two of the competition films this year focus on what happened there . indeed , the berlinale has garnered a reputation among industry executives as a quality market , albeit a euro-centric one .
translated into hollywood-speak , that means it 's not the place to buy popular , blockbuster material .
but that does n't bother kosslick . " we do n't want to be the biggest festival in the world , because we already are , " he said , referring to the fact that the berlinale plays to the largest audience of any film festival in the world .

but jürgen klinsmann 's squad gave up the lead twice and settled with a tie against argentina wednesday night . germany 's miserable run against top nations continues as argentina twice came from behind to net a 2:2 draw in the international friendly in düsseldorf .
the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schneider , center challenges for the ball with aldo pedro duscher , left , and juan pablo sorin , right , during the friendly match against argentina the germans played the better first half against the team klinsmann called " possibly the best team in the world at the moment . "
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .
penalties come in twos on the other side of the pitch , jens lehmann , who started in goal for germany while oliver kahn watched from the sidelines , faced a penalty kick duel of his own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's keeper jens lehmann fails to catch the 1-1 penalty wednesday night juan pablo sorin was chopped down by a cluster of defenders in what looked like a fair challenge to the upset german bench .
ac milan striker hernan crespo drilled the kick home , scoring his first of two goals on the night in the 40th minute .
" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .

spectacular lob draws score the trickery of saviola and villareal playmaker juan roman riquelme was a delight for the capacity 52,000 fans but not german defenders perplexed by their nimble footwork .
" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .
the south american team 's attacking quality is undoubtedly their strength and in the 81st minute a brilliant move carved the german defense apart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.02.2005 charles and camilla set to wed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the happy couple britain 's prince charles and his longtime companion camilla parker bowles are to marry , putting the official seal on a relationship that first blossomed 35 years ago . clarence house , charles 's residence in london , said the civil wedding would take place on april 8 at windsor castle , the royal family 's weekend retreat west of london . a subsequent service of prayer and dedication at the castle 's st george 's chapel will be led by the archbishop of canterbury , the spiritual head of the church of england .
" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .
jean holt , a housewife from essex , east of london , was also nenthusiastic .

happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .

he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .
the country has to seriously address that , if it 's not already too late .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " let 's leave that up to the conscience of the pope , " said sodano , who in the past dismissed talk of papal retirement .
" we have to have enormous faith in him .
he knows what he has to do . "
just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "

while it remains bad form to talk of the next pope in rome , dionigi tettamanzi , archbishop of milan ; francis arinze of nigeria ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , archbishop of tegucigalpa in honduras ; and angelo scola , another italian , the patriarch of venice are also seen to be in the unofficial running for the pontiff position .
as the pews in europe and north america remain empty , some observers have said a pontiff from africa or latin america would be a sign that the church is moving with the times .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .

just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 german civil servants get new deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : productivity will play more of a role in their work an agreement has finally been reached in the long-running pay dispute for germany 's more than 2 million federal and local public sector workers .
the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved . " we worked together extremely well and made some real progress towards the very end of the talks , " he said .
" and one giant step was managing to prevent the further privatization of public services . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske -lrb- r . -rrb- and interior minister otto schily announced the deal wednesday .
although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved . " we worked together extremely well and made some real progress towards the very end of the talks , " he said .
" and one giant step was managing to prevent the further privatization of public services . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske -lrb- r . -rrb- and interior minister otto schily announced the deal wednesday .
although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

he said germany must think about its children . speaking at the christian socialist union conference in the bavarian town of passau , party leader stoiber , said he was concerned about the well-being of children being brought up by same-sex parents .
" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

but thus far , the boys have n't exactly been fighting for a taste of the action .
on the contrary , they have shown their suitors the cold shoulder .

humboldt penguins are considered an endangered species , which makes it all the more important that those in captivity do the decent thing and reproduce .
the zoo is planning to wait until spring 2006 to see if their international match-making efforts spawn results . however , with humboldt penguins renowned for their gay persuasion , the odds are not stacked in favour of success .

he said germany must think about its children . speaking at the christian socialist union conference in the bavarian town of passau , party leader stoiber , said he was concerned about the well-being of children being brought up by same-sex parents .
" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "
he went on to dispute the ruling coalition 's justification to legalise gay adoption on the grounds that almost a quarter of gay and lesbians in germany wanted to have children .
" we are not talking here about self-realization of gays or lesbians , " he said .

at the end of last year , the government approved amendments introduced by justice minister brigitte zypries to the partnership law of 2001 which first introduced " gay marriage " to germany .
if unthwarted by the bavarian conservatives ' plans to block the bill , it would allow homosexuals to adopt the biological child of their partner , if the other biological parent consents .
if the amendments are passed by parliament , gay and lesbian " registered couples " will enjoy most of the same rights and responsibilities heterosexual spouses do , including pension rights and financial support responsibilities in the event of separation .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved . " we worked together extremely well and made some real progress towards the very end of the talks , " he said .
" and one giant step was managing to prevent the further privatization of public services . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske -lrb- r . -rrb- and interior minister otto schily announced the deal wednesday .
although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

" what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved .

frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .
this to my mind is the most important conclusion from the trip , " he said . the tide appears to be slowly turning .
through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .
" last month 's elections in iraq have helped the momentum .
there 's no point in arguing about the war any more as everyone agrees that we have to win the peace , " he told afp . simmering difficulties remain " this is all well and good , and sets things up nicely for the bush visit .
but there are a number of issues still simmering under the surface , not least china .

the eu 's intention to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo against china provided one cause of dissent during rice 's talks in europe .
us suspicions about iran 's nuclear programme provided another , with rice warning the heavyweight eu trio of britain , france and germany not to be too forgiving in their nuclear negotiations with the islamic regime . those issues , along with climate change and perennial trade disputes , will no doubt be prominent when president bush comes to brussels later this month on his first overseas visit since beginning his second term . he will as ever enjoy a warm welcome from british prime minister tony blair .

so far , there 's been no success . the zoo came up with the ingenious idea of trying to convert the feathered queens by flying in some exotic birds from scandinavia .
but thus far , the boys have n't exactly been fighting for a taste of the action .
on the contrary , they have shown their suitors the cold shoulder . " the relationships were obviously too serious , " zoo director heike kück said of the same sex penguin couples who seem to prefer sitting on stones , which serve as a replacement for the eggs they will never be able to lay , to flapping about over the evidently superfluous seductresses . but the zoo , which advertises itself with the slogan " encounters of a special kind , " is n't planning to give up too easily .
humboldt penguins are considered an endangered species , which makes it all the more important that those in captivity do the decent thing and reproduce .
the zoo is planning to wait until spring 2006 to see if their international match-making efforts spawn results . however , with humboldt penguins renowned for their gay persuasion , the odds are not stacked in favour of success .
but just in case the girls really ca n't pull of the conversion act , the zoo in sweden has sent a couple of its own males to save the ladies from out and out sexual frustration . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from animal antics and wacky inventions to celebrity gaffes and cultural idiosyncrasies - dw-world 's " and finally … " brings you news on weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .

but jürgen klinsmann 's squad gave up the lead twice and settled with a tie against argentina wednesday night . germany 's miserable run against top nations continues as argentina twice came from behind to net a 2:2 draw in the international friendly in düsseldorf .
the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schneider , center challenges for the ball with aldo pedro duscher , left , and juan pablo sorin , right , during the friendly match against argentina the germans played the better first half against the team klinsmann called " possibly the best team in the world at the moment . "
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .
penalties come in twos on the other side of the pitch , jens lehmann , who started in goal for germany while oliver kahn watched from the sidelines , faced a penalty kick duel of his own .

ac milan striker hernan crespo drilled the kick home , scoring his first of two goals on the night in the 40th minute .
" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .

spectacular lob draws score the trickery of saviola and villareal playmaker juan roman riquelme was a delight for the capacity 52,000 fans but not german defenders perplexed by their nimble footwork .
" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .
the south american team 's attacking quality is undoubtedly their strength and in the 81st minute a brilliant move carved the german defense apart .

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .

doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved . " we worked together extremely well and made some real progress towards the very end of the talks , " he said .
" and one giant step was managing to prevent the further privatization of public services . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske -lrb- r . -rrb- and interior minister otto schily announced the deal wednesday .
although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

he said germany must think about its children . speaking at the christian socialist union conference in the bavarian town of passau , party leader stoiber , said he was concerned about the well-being of children being brought up by same-sex parents .
" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "
he went on to dispute the ruling coalition 's justification to legalise gay adoption on the grounds that almost a quarter of gay and lesbians in germany wanted to have children .
" we are not talking here about self-realization of gays or lesbians , " he said .
no equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that " the discrimination of homosexual couples has to be consigned to history , " but the csu is opposed to granting homosexual couples equality with heterosexual relationships .
at the end of last year , the government approved amendments introduced by justice minister brigitte zypries to the partnership law of 2001 which first introduced " gay marriage " to germany .
if unthwarted by the bavarian conservatives ' plans to block the bill , it would allow homosexuals to adopt the biological child of their partner , if the other biological parent consents .
if the amendments are passed by parliament , gay and lesbian " registered couples " will enjoy most of the same rights and responsibilities heterosexual spouses do , including pension rights and financial support responsibilities in the event of separation .

but jürgen klinsmann 's squad gave up the lead twice and settled with a tie against argentina wednesday night . germany 's miserable run against top nations continues as argentina twice came from behind to net a 2:2 draw in the international friendly in düsseldorf .
the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "

wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " let 's leave that up to the conscience of the pope , " said sodano , who in the past dismissed talk of papal retirement .
" we have to have enormous faith in him .
he knows what he has to do . "
just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "
willing to take interim post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think of ratzinger -lrb- next to pope -rrb- as a top conservative papal candidate as head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which oversees moral and theological issues , all of ratzinger 's key decisions received the pontiff 's blessing , leading some to call him " john paul iii " the bavarian cardinal is against allowing priests to marry and has taken a hard line against abortion .
while it remains bad form to talk of the next pope in rome , dionigi tettamanzi , archbishop of milan ; francis arinze of nigeria ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , archbishop of tegucigalpa in honduras ; and angelo scola , another italian , the patriarch of venice are also seen to be in the unofficial running for the pontiff position .
as the pews in europe and north america remain empty , some observers have said a pontiff from africa or latin america would be a sign that the church is moving with the times .
possibly as a way of pleasing his supporters and calming his foes , ratzinger himself has said if he were to become pontiff , he would be prepared " to give up the job after a few years .

his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .

" we have to have enormous faith in him .
he knows what he has to do . "
just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "

but jürgen klinsmann 's squad gave up the lead twice and settled with a tie against argentina wednesday night . germany 's miserable run against top nations continues as argentina twice came from behind to net a 2:2 draw in the international friendly in düsseldorf .
the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "

"
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .
penalties come in twos on the other side of the pitch , jens lehmann , who started in goal for germany while oliver kahn watched from the sidelines , faced a penalty kick duel of his own .

ac milan striker hernan crespo drilled the kick home , scoring his first of two goals on the night in the 40th minute .
" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .

spectacular lob draws score the trickery of saviola and villareal playmaker juan roman riquelme was a delight for the capacity 52,000 fans but not german defenders perplexed by their nimble footwork .
" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .
the south american team 's attacking quality is undoubtedly their strength and in the 81st minute a brilliant move carved the german defense apart .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved .

" in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 pushing the boundaries of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the limit of medical possibilities been reached ?
while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "

but jürgen klinsmann 's squad gave up the lead twice and settled with a tie against argentina wednesday night . germany 's miserable run against top nations continues as argentina twice came from behind to net a 2:2 draw in the international friendly in düsseldorf .
the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schneider , center challenges for the ball with aldo pedro duscher , left , and juan pablo sorin , right , during the friendly match against argentina the germans played the better first half against the team klinsmann called " possibly the best team in the world at the moment . "
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .
penalties come in twos on the other side of the pitch , jens lehmann , who started in goal for germany while oliver kahn watched from the sidelines , faced a penalty kick duel of his own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's keeper jens lehmann fails to catch the 1-1 penalty wednesday night juan pablo sorin was chopped down by a cluster of defenders in what looked like a fair challenge to the upset german bench .
ac milan striker hernan crespo drilled the kick home , scoring his first of two goals on the night in the 40th minute .
" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's nicolas burdisso , behind , struggles with germany 's bastian schweinsteiger on the hour mark crespo appeared to be felled by lehmann in the box but the referee chose not to award a third spot-kick claiming there had been no contact .
spectacular lob draws score the trickery of saviola and villareal playmaker juan roman riquelme was a delight for the capacity 52,000 fans but not german defenders perplexed by their nimble footwork .
" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .
the south american team 's attacking quality is undoubtedly their strength and in the 81st minute a brilliant move carved the german defense apart .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " let 's leave that up to the conscience of the pope , " said sodano , who in the past dismissed talk of papal retirement .
" we have to have enormous faith in him .
he knows what he has to do . "
just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "
willing to take interim post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think of ratzinger -lrb- next to pope -rrb- as a top conservative papal candidate as head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which oversees moral and theological issues , all of ratzinger 's key decisions received the pontiff 's blessing , leading some to call him " john paul iii " the bavarian cardinal is against allowing priests to marry and has taken a hard line against abortion .
while it remains bad form to talk of the next pope in rome , dionigi tettamanzi , archbishop of milan ; francis arinze of nigeria ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , archbishop of tegucigalpa in honduras ; and angelo scola , another italian , the patriarch of venice are also seen to be in the unofficial running for the pontiff position .
as the pews in europe and north america remain empty , some observers have said a pontiff from africa or latin america would be a sign that the church is moving with the times .
possibly as a way of pleasing his supporters and calming his foes , ratzinger himself has said if he were to become pontiff , he would be prepared " to give up the job after a few years .

he said germany must think about its children . speaking at the christian socialist union conference in the bavarian town of passau , party leader stoiber , said he was concerned about the well-being of children being brought up by same-sex parents .
" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "

but jürgen klinsmann 's squad gave up the lead twice and settled with a tie against argentina wednesday night . germany 's miserable run against top nations continues as argentina twice came from behind to net a 2:2 draw in the international friendly in düsseldorf .
the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schneider , center challenges for the ball with aldo pedro duscher , left , and juan pablo sorin , right , during the friendly match against argentina the germans played the better first half against the team klinsmann called " possibly the best team in the world at the moment . "
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .
penalties come in twos on the other side of the pitch , jens lehmann , who started in goal for germany while oliver kahn watched from the sidelines , faced a penalty kick duel of his own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's keeper jens lehmann fails to catch the 1-1 penalty wednesday night juan pablo sorin was chopped down by a cluster of defenders in what looked like a fair challenge to the upset german bench .
ac milan striker hernan crespo drilled the kick home , scoring his first of two goals on the night in the 40th minute .
" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's nicolas burdisso , behind , struggles with germany 's bastian schweinsteiger on the hour mark crespo appeared to be felled by lehmann in the box but the referee chose not to award a third spot-kick claiming there had been no contact .
spectacular lob draws score the trickery of saviola and villareal playmaker juan roman riquelme was a delight for the capacity 52,000 fans but not german defenders perplexed by their nimble footwork .
" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .
the south american team 's attacking quality is undoubtedly their strength and in the 81st minute a brilliant move carved the german defense apart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 pushing the boundaries of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the limit of medical possibilities been reached ?
while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

so far , there 's been no success . the zoo came up with the ingenious idea of trying to convert the feathered queens by flying in some exotic birds from scandinavia .
but thus far , the boys have n't exactly been fighting for a taste of the action .
on the contrary , they have shown their suitors the cold shoulder . " the relationships were obviously too serious , " zoo director heike kück said of the same sex penguin couples who seem to prefer sitting on stones , which serve as a replacement for the eggs they will never be able to lay , to flapping about over the evidently superfluous seductresses . but the zoo , which advertises itself with the slogan " encounters of a special kind , " is n't planning to give up too easily .
humboldt penguins are considered an endangered species , which makes it all the more important that those in captivity do the decent thing and reproduce .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers call the bombing a war crime against germans on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .
the country has to seriously address that , if it 's not already too late .

" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .

so far , there 's been no success . the zoo came up with the ingenious idea of trying to convert the feathered queens by flying in some exotic birds from scandinavia .
but thus far , the boys have n't exactly been fighting for a taste of the action .
on the contrary , they have shown their suitors the cold shoulder . " the relationships were obviously too serious , " zoo director heike kück said of the same sex penguin couples who seem to prefer sitting on stones , which serve as a replacement for the eggs they will never be able to lay , to flapping about over the evidently superfluous seductresses . but the zoo , which advertises itself with the slogan " encounters of a special kind , " is n't planning to give up too easily .
humboldt penguins are considered an endangered species , which makes it all the more important that those in captivity do the decent thing and reproduce .
the zoo is planning to wait until spring 2006 to see if their international match-making efforts spawn results . however , with humboldt penguins renowned for their gay persuasion , the odds are not stacked in favour of success .
but just in case the girls really ca n't pull of the conversion act , the zoo in sweden has sent a couple of its own males to save the ladies from out and out sexual frustration . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from animal antics and wacky inventions to celebrity gaffes and cultural idiosyncrasies - dw-world 's " and finally … " brings you news on weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers call the bombing a war crime against germans on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .
the country has to seriously address that , if it 's not already too late .

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .

vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .

just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "

he said germany must think about its children . speaking at the christian socialist union conference in the bavarian town of passau , party leader stoiber , said he was concerned about the well-being of children being brought up by same-sex parents .
" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "
he went on to dispute the ruling coalition 's justification to legalise gay adoption on the grounds that almost a quarter of gay and lesbians in germany wanted to have children .
" we are not talking here about self-realization of gays or lesbians , " he said .
no equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that " the discrimination of homosexual couples has to be consigned to history , " but the csu is opposed to granting homosexual couples equality with heterosexual relationships .
at the end of last year , the government approved amendments introduced by justice minister brigitte zypries to the partnership law of 2001 which first introduced " gay marriage " to germany .
if unthwarted by the bavarian conservatives ' plans to block the bill , it would allow homosexuals to adopt the biological child of their partner , if the other biological parent consents .
if the amendments are passed by parliament , gay and lesbian " registered couples " will enjoy most of the same rights and responsibilities heterosexual spouses do , including pension rights and financial support responsibilities in the event of separation .
the governing social democratic-green coalition also wants to introduce gay engagements , which would allow one partner to refuse to testify against the other in court . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay marriage upsets spain 's catholic church a spanish bill allowing gay marriage is expected to go to parliament has the catholic church up in arms .

so far , there 's been no success . the zoo came up with the ingenious idea of trying to convert the feathered queens by flying in some exotic birds from scandinavia .
but thus far , the boys have n't exactly been fighting for a taste of the action .
on the contrary , they have shown their suitors the cold shoulder . " the relationships were obviously too serious , " zoo director heike kück said of the same sex penguin couples who seem to prefer sitting on stones , which serve as a replacement for the eggs they will never be able to lay , to flapping about over the evidently superfluous seductresses . but the zoo , which advertises itself with the slogan " encounters of a special kind , " is n't planning to give up too easily .
humboldt penguins are considered an endangered species , which makes it all the more important that those in captivity do the decent thing and reproduce .
the zoo is planning to wait until spring 2006 to see if their international match-making efforts spawn results . however , with humboldt penguins renowned for their gay persuasion , the odds are not stacked in favour of success .
but just in case the girls really ca n't pull of the conversion act , the zoo in sweden has sent a couple of its own males to save the ladies from out and out sexual frustration . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from animal antics and wacky inventions to celebrity gaffes and cultural idiosyncrasies - dw-world 's " and finally … " brings you news on weird and wonderful happenings from all over germany .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved . " we worked together extremely well and made some real progress towards the very end of the talks , " he said .
" and one giant step was managing to prevent the further privatization of public services . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske -lrb- r . -rrb- and interior minister otto schily announced the deal wednesday .
although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .
the country has to seriously address that , if it 's not already too late .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved .

although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved .

although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved . " we worked together extremely well and made some real progress towards the very end of the talks , " he said .
" and one giant step was managing to prevent the further privatization of public services . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske -lrb- r . -rrb- and interior minister otto schily announced the deal wednesday .
although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.02.2005 charles and camilla set to wed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the happy couple britain 's prince charles and his longtime companion camilla parker bowles are to marry , putting the official seal on a relationship that first blossomed 35 years ago . clarence house , charles 's residence in london , said the civil wedding would take place on april 8 at windsor castle , the royal family 's weekend retreat west of london . a subsequent service of prayer and dedication at the castle 's st george 's chapel will be led by the archbishop of canterbury , the spiritual head of the church of england .
" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .
jean holt , a housewife from essex , east of london , was also nenthusiastic .

it was widely believed that in the event of the cold war escalating to " hot , " the united states would have sacrificed germany in a nuclear exchange with the soviet union in a bid to protect the rest of europe . currently , 150 bombs which would have been used in that scenario are still on german soil .
during the height of the cold war , the united states had as many as 7,000 nuclear warheads in europe . bombs scattered across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states ' closest ally , britain , currently plays host to 110 tactical nuclear missiles at the lakenheath airbase in suffolk , the home of american f-15 fighter planes in the uk .
this is figure itself is three times as high as previously thought .
elsewhere around europe , the us has 90 bombs deployed at incirlik in south-eastern turkey , 90 in italy and 20 each in belgium and the netherlands , according to the nrdc . the 100-page report , which was posted on the nrdc 's web site on wednesday , is based on documents obtained under the us freedom of information act , military publications , commercial satellite imagery and other material . confusion over deterrent 's use questions are bound to be raised by concerned europeans as to why such a large number of weapons of mass destruction are still scattered across europe when the specter of the soviet union no longer exists .
while the nrdc speculates that the potential targets for the missiles are likely to be in russia , iran and syria , the official nato line states that nuclear bombs in europe are not aimed at any particular country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the actual number of missiles still on european soil may come as a surprise to the majority of people living on the continent , the most revealing aspect of the nrdc report is that regarding us policy towards the use of the weapons in time of war . non-nuke nato states have bomb option while britain , with its estimated 200 strategic nuclear warheads , and france , with as many as 350 , are the continents main nuclear powers and would therefore defend themselves , the american policy regarding use of european-based nuclear weapons in war would allow non-nuclear european nato members to use us weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the event of a nuclear conflict , the us would provide as many as 180 bombs which would be dropped by belgian , german , italian , dutch , and turkish aircraft . us policy contravenes treaty according to the nrdc , this policy breaches international law because the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons -lrb- npt -rrb- prohibits a nuclear state from transferring nuclear weapons to a non-weapon state , and prohibits a non-nuclear state from receiving such weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean rocket " paektusan i , " is test launched in an undisclosed facility somewhere in north hamgyong province , north korea august 31 , 1998 .
the nrdc also claims that the mere presence of the weapons on european soil contradicts the npt by providing non-nuclear states with weapons protection under a us nuclear umbrella . " the continuing presence of these weapons irritates relations with russia , undermines global efforts to dissuade other nations from developing nuclear weapons , and impedes nato 's post-cold war evolution , " the nrdc states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial nukes decision remembered in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .

but with bush on the horizon , can europeans expect a real change in transatlantic relations ? the european union appears far better disposed towards the united states after us secretary of state condoleezza rice swept through the continent on a pre-summit charm offensive . but while the coolly sophisticated rice got on famously with everyone , it remains to be seen whether president george w. bush will find such a good personal rapport when he meets eu and nato leaders here on february 21 . even as the two sides try to move on from their divisions over the us-led war in iraq , new sources of discomfort are in the offing in the shape of iran and china . however , rice and her eu interlocutors were at pains to stress that a new chapter is at hand after the iraq conflict badly frayed transatlantic relations . europe ready to do business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice addresses european intellectuals on u.s. foreign policy in the world , at paris science politique institute , tuesday , feb .
8 , 2005 .
speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .
this to my mind is the most important conclusion from the trip , " he said . the tide appears to be slowly turning .
through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .
" last month 's elections in iraq have helped the momentum .
there 's no point in arguing about the war any more as everyone agrees that we have to win the peace , " he told afp . simmering difficulties remain " this is all well and good , and sets things up nicely for the bush visit .
but there are a number of issues still simmering under the surface , not least china .
and iran could be even more divisive than iraq , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
the eu 's intention to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo against china provided one cause of dissent during rice 's talks in europe .
us suspicions about iran 's nuclear programme provided another , with rice warning the heavyweight eu trio of britain , france and germany not to be too forgiving in their nuclear negotiations with the islamic regime . those issues , along with climate change and perennial trade disputes , will no doubt be prominent when president bush comes to brussels later this month on his first overseas visit since beginning his second term . he will as ever enjoy a warm welcome from british prime minister tony blair .
what will be more intriguing is how bush gets on with french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but there at least the rice tour has done much to smooth the way . condi the difference for jacques , gerd " chirac and schröder have indicated they want to do business with bush .
and for them , doing business with rice has been different to doing business with colin powell .
they know that she has the ear of the president , which makes all the difference , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indeed , rice got a dose of french charm in return during a stop in paris when chirac showered praise on a keynote speech she gave pledging a new page in transatlantic ties . but as a senior state department official noted : " one swallow does n't make a spring .

speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .
this to my mind is the most important conclusion from the trip , " he said . the tide appears to be slowly turning .
through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .
" last month 's elections in iraq have helped the momentum .
there 's no point in arguing about the war any more as everyone agrees that we have to win the peace , " he told afp . simmering difficulties remain " this is all well and good , and sets things up nicely for the bush visit .

speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .

through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .

but with bush on the horizon , can europeans expect a real change in transatlantic relations ? the european union appears far better disposed towards the united states after us secretary of state condoleezza rice swept through the continent on a pre-summit charm offensive . but while the coolly sophisticated rice got on famously with everyone , it remains to be seen whether president george w. bush will find such a good personal rapport when he meets eu and nato leaders here on february 21 . even as the two sides try to move on from their divisions over the us-led war in iraq , new sources of discomfort are in the offing in the shape of iran and china . however , rice and her eu interlocutors were at pains to stress that a new chapter is at hand after the iraq conflict badly frayed transatlantic relations . europe ready to do business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice addresses european intellectuals on u.s. foreign policy in the world , at paris science politique institute , tuesday , feb .
8 , 2005 .
speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .
this to my mind is the most important conclusion from the trip , " he said . the tide appears to be slowly turning .
through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .
" last month 's elections in iraq have helped the momentum .
there 's no point in arguing about the war any more as everyone agrees that we have to win the peace , " he told afp . simmering difficulties remain " this is all well and good , and sets things up nicely for the bush visit .
but there are a number of issues still simmering under the surface , not least china .
and iran could be even more divisive than iraq , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
the eu 's intention to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo against china provided one cause of dissent during rice 's talks in europe .
us suspicions about iran 's nuclear programme provided another , with rice warning the heavyweight eu trio of britain , france and germany not to be too forgiving in their nuclear negotiations with the islamic regime . those issues , along with climate change and perennial trade disputes , will no doubt be prominent when president bush comes to brussels later this month on his first overseas visit since beginning his second term . he will as ever enjoy a warm welcome from british prime minister tony blair .
what will be more intriguing is how bush gets on with french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but there at least the rice tour has done much to smooth the way . condi the difference for jacques , gerd " chirac and schröder have indicated they want to do business with bush .
and for them , doing business with rice has been different to doing business with colin powell .
they know that she has the ear of the president , which makes all the difference , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indeed , rice got a dose of french charm in return during a stop in paris when chirac showered praise on a keynote speech she gave pledging a new page in transatlantic ties . but as a senior state department official noted : " one swallow does n't make a spring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.02.2005 charles and camilla set to wed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the happy couple britain 's prince charles and his longtime companion camilla parker bowles are to marry , putting the official seal on a relationship that first blossomed 35 years ago . clarence house , charles 's residence in london , said the civil wedding would take place on april 8 at windsor castle , the royal family 's weekend retreat west of london . a subsequent service of prayer and dedication at the castle 's st george 's chapel will be led by the archbishop of canterbury , the spiritual head of the church of england .
" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .
jean holt , a housewife from essex , east of london , was also nenthusiastic .

it was widely believed that in the event of the cold war escalating to " hot , " the united states would have sacrificed germany in a nuclear exchange with the soviet union in a bid to protect the rest of europe . currently , 150 bombs which would have been used in that scenario are still on german soil .
during the height of the cold war , the united states had as many as 7,000 nuclear warheads in europe . bombs scattered across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states ' closest ally , britain , currently plays host to 110 tactical nuclear missiles at the lakenheath airbase in suffolk , the home of american f-15 fighter planes in the uk .
this is figure itself is three times as high as previously thought .
elsewhere around europe , the us has 90 bombs deployed at incirlik in south-eastern turkey , 90 in italy and 20 each in belgium and the netherlands , according to the nrdc . the 100-page report , which was posted on the nrdc 's web site on wednesday , is based on documents obtained under the us freedom of information act , military publications , commercial satellite imagery and other material . confusion over deterrent 's use questions are bound to be raised by concerned europeans as to why such a large number of weapons of mass destruction are still scattered across europe when the specter of the soviet union no longer exists .
while the nrdc speculates that the potential targets for the missiles are likely to be in russia , iran and syria , the official nato line states that nuclear bombs in europe are not aimed at any particular country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the actual number of missiles still on european soil may come as a surprise to the majority of people living on the continent , the most revealing aspect of the nrdc report is that regarding us policy towards the use of the weapons in time of war . non-nuke nato states have bomb option while britain , with its estimated 200 strategic nuclear warheads , and france , with as many as 350 , are the continents main nuclear powers and would therefore defend themselves , the american policy regarding use of european-based nuclear weapons in war would allow non-nuclear european nato members to use us weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the event of a nuclear conflict , the us would provide as many as 180 bombs which would be dropped by belgian , german , italian , dutch , and turkish aircraft . us policy contravenes treaty according to the nrdc , this policy breaches international law because the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons -lrb- npt -rrb- prohibits a nuclear state from transferring nuclear weapons to a non-weapon state , and prohibits a non-nuclear state from receiving such weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean rocket " paektusan i , " is test launched in an undisclosed facility somewhere in north hamgyong province , north korea august 31 , 1998 .
the nrdc also claims that the mere presence of the weapons on european soil contradicts the npt by providing non-nuclear states with weapons protection under a us nuclear umbrella . " the continuing presence of these weapons irritates relations with russia , undermines global efforts to dissuade other nations from developing nuclear weapons , and impedes nato 's post-cold war evolution , " the nrdc states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial nukes decision remembered in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .

cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers call the bombing a war crime against germans on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .
the country has to seriously address that , if it 's not already too late .

" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .

" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers call the bombing a war crime against germans on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .
the country has to seriously address that , if it 's not already too late .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .

it was widely believed that in the event of the cold war escalating to " hot , " the united states would have sacrificed germany in a nuclear exchange with the soviet union in a bid to protect the rest of europe . currently , 150 bombs which would have been used in that scenario are still on german soil .
during the height of the cold war , the united states had as many as 7,000 nuclear warheads in europe . bombs scattered across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states ' closest ally , britain , currently plays host to 110 tactical nuclear missiles at the lakenheath airbase in suffolk , the home of american f-15 fighter planes in the uk .
this is figure itself is three times as high as previously thought .
elsewhere around europe , the us has 90 bombs deployed at incirlik in south-eastern turkey , 90 in italy and 20 each in belgium and the netherlands , according to the nrdc . the 100-page report , which was posted on the nrdc 's web site on wednesday , is based on documents obtained under the us freedom of information act , military publications , commercial satellite imagery and other material . confusion over deterrent 's use questions are bound to be raised by concerned europeans as to why such a large number of weapons of mass destruction are still scattered across europe when the specter of the soviet union no longer exists .
while the nrdc speculates that the potential targets for the missiles are likely to be in russia , iran and syria , the official nato line states that nuclear bombs in europe are not aimed at any particular country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the actual number of missiles still on european soil may come as a surprise to the majority of people living on the continent , the most revealing aspect of the nrdc report is that regarding us policy towards the use of the weapons in time of war . non-nuke nato states have bomb option while britain , with its estimated 200 strategic nuclear warheads , and france , with as many as 350 , are the continents main nuclear powers and would therefore defend themselves , the american policy regarding use of european-based nuclear weapons in war would allow non-nuclear european nato members to use us weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the event of a nuclear conflict , the us would provide as many as 180 bombs which would be dropped by belgian , german , italian , dutch , and turkish aircraft . us policy contravenes treaty according to the nrdc , this policy breaches international law because the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons -lrb- npt -rrb- prohibits a nuclear state from transferring nuclear weapons to a non-weapon state , and prohibits a non-nuclear state from receiving such weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean rocket " paektusan i , " is test launched in an undisclosed facility somewhere in north hamgyong province , north korea august 31 , 1998 .
the nrdc also claims that the mere presence of the weapons on european soil contradicts the npt by providing non-nuclear states with weapons protection under a us nuclear umbrella . " the continuing presence of these weapons irritates relations with russia , undermines global efforts to dissuade other nations from developing nuclear weapons , and impedes nato 's post-cold war evolution , " the nrdc states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial nukes decision remembered in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .

speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .
this to my mind is the most important conclusion from the trip , " he said . the tide appears to be slowly turning .
through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .
" last month 's elections in iraq have helped the momentum .
there 's no point in arguing about the war any more as everyone agrees that we have to win the peace , " he told afp . simmering difficulties remain " this is all well and good , and sets things up nicely for the bush visit .

speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .

through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .

the eu 's intention to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo against china provided one cause of dissent during rice 's talks in europe .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .

just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "

volker kauder , secretary general for the christian democratic union , rejected chancellor gerhard schröder 's suggestion to hold the commemoration ceremony for the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 at the brandenburg gate instead of the reichstag , the newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday .
with the suggested switch of localities , the chancellor intends to counteract announced marches by neo-nazis at the historical berlin sight .
" i would consider it a miserable message , if the bundestag was going to let itself be driven out of the reichstag by the npd " , kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung .
in his opinion , changing places does not solve the problem of assemblies by right-wing radicals .
kauder is open towards another kind of protest event at the brandenburg gate on may 8 and expressed his confidence that the npd is not going to march in the end .
but he regards stronger restrictions on the right to assemble as the only way to deal with the problem . dw-world.de germany fights right-wing extremism german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party .

volker kauder , secretary general for the christian democratic union , rejected chancellor gerhard schröder 's suggestion to hold the commemoration ceremony for the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 at the brandenburg gate instead of the reichstag , the newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday .

in his opinion , changing places does not solve the problem of assemblies by right-wing radicals .

volker kauder , secretary general for the christian democratic union , rejected chancellor gerhard schröder 's suggestion to hold the commemoration ceremony for the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 at the brandenburg gate instead of the reichstag , the newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday .
with the suggested switch of localities , the chancellor intends to counteract announced marches by neo-nazis at the historical berlin sight .

in his opinion , changing places does not solve the problem of assemblies by right-wing radicals .
kauder is open towards another kind of protest event at the brandenburg gate on may 8 and expressed his confidence that the npd is not going to march in the end .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily .

the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved .

volker kauder , secretary general for the christian democratic union , rejected chancellor gerhard schröder 's suggestion to hold the commemoration ceremony for the 60th anniversary of german capitulation on may 8 at the brandenburg gate instead of the reichstag , the newsmagazine der spiegel reported on thursday .
with the suggested switch of localities , the chancellor intends to counteract announced marches by neo-nazis at the historical berlin sight .
" i would consider it a miserable message , if the bundestag was going to let itself be driven out of the reichstag by the npd " , kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung .
in his opinion , changing places does not solve the problem of assemblies by right-wing radicals .
kauder is open towards another kind of protest event at the brandenburg gate on may 8 and expressed his confidence that the npd is not going to march in the end .

but jürgen klinsmann 's squad gave up the lead twice and settled with a tie against argentina wednesday night . germany 's miserable run against top nations continues as argentina twice came from behind to net a 2:2 draw in the international friendly in düsseldorf .
the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "

"
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .
penalties come in twos on the other side of the pitch , jens lehmann , who started in goal for germany while oliver kahn watched from the sidelines , faced a penalty kick duel of his own .

ac milan striker hernan crespo drilled the kick home , scoring his first of two goals on the night in the 40th minute .
" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .

spectacular lob draws score the trickery of saviola and villareal playmaker juan roman riquelme was a delight for the capacity 52,000 fans but not german defenders perplexed by their nimble footwork .
" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .

the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .

" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .

he said germany must think about its children . speaking at the christian socialist union conference in the bavarian town of passau , party leader stoiber , said he was concerned about the well-being of children being brought up by same-sex parents .
" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "
he went on to dispute the ruling coalition 's justification to legalise gay adoption on the grounds that almost a quarter of gay and lesbians in germany wanted to have children .
" we are not talking here about self-realization of gays or lesbians , " he said .

at the end of last year , the government approved amendments introduced by justice minister brigitte zypries to the partnership law of 2001 which first introduced " gay marriage " to germany .
if unthwarted by the bavarian conservatives ' plans to block the bill , it would allow homosexuals to adopt the biological child of their partner , if the other biological parent consents .
if the amendments are passed by parliament , gay and lesbian " registered couples " will enjoy most of the same rights and responsibilities heterosexual spouses do , including pension rights and financial support responsibilities in the event of separation .

but with bush on the horizon , can europeans expect a real change in transatlantic relations ? the european union appears far better disposed towards the united states after us secretary of state condoleezza rice swept through the continent on a pre-summit charm offensive . but while the coolly sophisticated rice got on famously with everyone , it remains to be seen whether president george w. bush will find such a good personal rapport when he meets eu and nato leaders here on february 21 . even as the two sides try to move on from their divisions over the us-led war in iraq , new sources of discomfort are in the offing in the shape of iran and china . however , rice and her eu interlocutors were at pains to stress that a new chapter is at hand after the iraq conflict badly frayed transatlantic relations . europe ready to do business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice addresses european intellectuals on u.s. foreign policy in the world , at paris science politique institute , tuesday , feb .
8 , 2005 .
speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .
this to my mind is the most important conclusion from the trip , " he said . the tide appears to be slowly turning .
through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .
" last month 's elections in iraq have helped the momentum .
there 's no point in arguing about the war any more as everyone agrees that we have to win the peace , " he told afp . simmering difficulties remain " this is all well and good , and sets things up nicely for the bush visit .
but there are a number of issues still simmering under the surface , not least china .
and iran could be even more divisive than iraq , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
the eu 's intention to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo against china provided one cause of dissent during rice 's talks in europe .
us suspicions about iran 's nuclear programme provided another , with rice warning the heavyweight eu trio of britain , france and germany not to be too forgiving in their nuclear negotiations with the islamic regime . those issues , along with climate change and perennial trade disputes , will no doubt be prominent when president bush comes to brussels later this month on his first overseas visit since beginning his second term . he will as ever enjoy a warm welcome from british prime minister tony blair .
what will be more intriguing is how bush gets on with french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but there at least the rice tour has done much to smooth the way . condi the difference for jacques , gerd " chirac and schröder have indicated they want to do business with bush .
and for them , doing business with rice has been different to doing business with colin powell .
they know that she has the ear of the president , which makes all the difference , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indeed , rice got a dose of french charm in return during a stop in paris when chirac showered praise on a keynote speech she gave pledging a new page in transatlantic ties . but as a senior state department official noted : " one swallow does n't make a spring .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved . " we worked together extremely well and made some real progress towards the very end of the talks , " he said .
" and one giant step was managing to prevent the further privatization of public services . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske -lrb- r . -rrb- and interior minister otto schily announced the deal wednesday .

but jürgen klinsmann 's squad gave up the lead twice and settled with a tie against argentina wednesday night . germany 's miserable run against top nations continues as argentina twice came from behind to net a 2:2 draw in the international friendly in düsseldorf .
the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schneider , center challenges for the ball with aldo pedro duscher , left , and juan pablo sorin , right , during the friendly match against argentina the germans played the better first half against the team klinsmann called " possibly the best team in the world at the moment . "
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .
penalties come in twos on the other side of the pitch , jens lehmann , who started in goal for germany while oliver kahn watched from the sidelines , faced a penalty kick duel of his own .

ac milan striker hernan crespo drilled the kick home , scoring his first of two goals on the night in the 40th minute .
" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .

spectacular lob draws score the trickery of saviola and villareal playmaker juan roman riquelme was a delight for the capacity 52,000 fans but not german defenders perplexed by their nimble footwork .
" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .
the south american team 's attacking quality is undoubtedly their strength and in the 81st minute a brilliant move carved the german defense apart .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .

the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .
the country has to seriously address that , if it 's not already too late .

" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 pushing the boundaries of life großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : has the limit of medical possibilities been reached ?
while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .

but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .

argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.02.2005 charles and camilla set to wed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the happy couple britain 's prince charles and his longtime companion camilla parker bowles are to marry , putting the official seal on a relationship that first blossomed 35 years ago . clarence house , charles 's residence in london , said the civil wedding would take place on april 8 at windsor castle , the royal family 's weekend retreat west of london . a subsequent service of prayer and dedication at the castle 's st george 's chapel will be led by the archbishop of canterbury , the spiritual head of the church of england .
" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .
jean holt , a housewife from essex , east of london , was also nenthusiastic .
" i loved diana , so i do n't want charles to be king , especially with camilla as his wife .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.02.2005 charles and camilla set to wed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the happy couple britain 's prince charles and his longtime companion camilla parker bowles are to marry , putting the official seal on a relationship that first blossomed 35 years ago . clarence house , charles 's residence in london , said the civil wedding would take place on april 8 at windsor castle , the royal family 's weekend retreat west of london . a subsequent service of prayer and dedication at the castle 's st george 's chapel will be led by the archbishop of canterbury , the spiritual head of the church of england .
" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .
jean holt , a housewife from essex , east of london , was also nenthusiastic .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " let 's leave that up to the conscience of the pope , " said sodano , who in the past dismissed talk of papal retirement .
" we have to have enormous faith in him .
he knows what he has to do . "
just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "

as the pews in europe and north america remain empty , some observers have said a pontiff from africa or latin america would be a sign that the church is moving with the times .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " let 's leave that up to the conscience of the pope , " said sodano , who in the past dismissed talk of papal retirement .
" we have to have enormous faith in him .
he knows what he has to do . "
just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "
willing to take interim post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think of ratzinger -lrb- next to pope -rrb- as a top conservative papal candidate as head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which oversees moral and theological issues , all of ratzinger 's key decisions received the pontiff 's blessing , leading some to call him " john paul iii " the bavarian cardinal is against allowing priests to marry and has taken a hard line against abortion .
while it remains bad form to talk of the next pope in rome , dionigi tettamanzi , archbishop of milan ; francis arinze of nigeria ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , archbishop of tegucigalpa in honduras ; and angelo scola , another italian , the patriarch of venice are also seen to be in the unofficial running for the pontiff position .
as the pews in europe and north america remain empty , some observers have said a pontiff from africa or latin america would be a sign that the church is moving with the times .
possibly as a way of pleasing his supporters and calming his foes , ratzinger himself has said if he were to become pontiff , he would be prepared " to give up the job after a few years .

" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .

" obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved . " we worked together extremely well and made some real progress towards the very end of the talks , " he said .
" and one giant step was managing to prevent the further privatization of public services . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske -lrb- r . -rrb- and interior minister otto schily announced the deal wednesday .
although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

but with bush on the horizon , can europeans expect a real change in transatlantic relations ? the european union appears far better disposed towards the united states after us secretary of state condoleezza rice swept through the continent on a pre-summit charm offensive . but while the coolly sophisticated rice got on famously with everyone , it remains to be seen whether president george w. bush will find such a good personal rapport when he meets eu and nato leaders here on february 21 . even as the two sides try to move on from their divisions over the us-led war in iraq , new sources of discomfort are in the offing in the shape of iran and china . however , rice and her eu interlocutors were at pains to stress that a new chapter is at hand after the iraq conflict badly frayed transatlantic relations . europe ready to do business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice addresses european intellectuals on u.s. foreign policy in the world , at paris science politique institute , tuesday , feb .
8 , 2005 .
speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .
this to my mind is the most important conclusion from the trip , " he said . the tide appears to be slowly turning .
through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .
" last month 's elections in iraq have helped the momentum .
there 's no point in arguing about the war any more as everyone agrees that we have to win the peace , " he told afp . simmering difficulties remain " this is all well and good , and sets things up nicely for the bush visit .
but there are a number of issues still simmering under the surface , not least china .
and iran could be even more divisive than iraq , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
the eu 's intention to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo against china provided one cause of dissent during rice 's talks in europe .
us suspicions about iran 's nuclear programme provided another , with rice warning the heavyweight eu trio of britain , france and germany not to be too forgiving in their nuclear negotiations with the islamic regime . those issues , along with climate change and perennial trade disputes , will no doubt be prominent when president bush comes to brussels later this month on his first overseas visit since beginning his second term . he will as ever enjoy a warm welcome from british prime minister tony blair .
what will be more intriguing is how bush gets on with french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but there at least the rice tour has done much to smooth the way . condi the difference for jacques , gerd " chirac and schröder have indicated they want to do business with bush .
and for them , doing business with rice has been different to doing business with colin powell .
they know that she has the ear of the president , which makes all the difference , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indeed , rice got a dose of french charm in return during a stop in paris when chirac showered praise on a keynote speech she gave pledging a new page in transatlantic ties . but as a senior state department official noted : " one swallow does n't make a spring .

the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "

"
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .
penalties come in twos on the other side of the pitch , jens lehmann , who started in goal for germany while oliver kahn watched from the sidelines , faced a penalty kick duel of his own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's keeper jens lehmann fails to catch the 1-1 penalty wednesday night juan pablo sorin was chopped down by a cluster of defenders in what looked like a fair challenge to the upset german bench .
ac milan striker hernan crespo drilled the kick home , scoring his first of two goals on the night in the 40th minute .
" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .

" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .
the south american team 's attacking quality is undoubtedly their strength and in the 81st minute a brilliant move carved the german defense apart .

elsewhere around europe , the us has 90 bombs deployed at incirlik in south-eastern turkey , 90 in italy and 20 each in belgium and the netherlands , according to the nrdc . the 100-page report , which was posted on the nrdc 's web site on wednesday , is based on documents obtained under the us freedom of information act , military publications , commercial satellite imagery and other material . confusion over deterrent 's use questions are bound to be raised by concerned europeans as to why such a large number of weapons of mass destruction are still scattered across europe when the specter of the soviet union no longer exists .
while the nrdc speculates that the potential targets for the missiles are likely to be in russia , iran and syria , the official nato line states that nuclear bombs in europe are not aimed at any particular country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the actual number of missiles still on european soil may come as a surprise to the majority of people living on the continent , the most revealing aspect of the nrdc report is that regarding us policy towards the use of the weapons in time of war . non-nuke nato states have bomb option while britain , with its estimated 200 strategic nuclear warheads , and france , with as many as 350 , are the continents main nuclear powers and would therefore defend themselves , the american policy regarding use of european-based nuclear weapons in war would allow non-nuclear european nato members to use us weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the event of a nuclear conflict , the us would provide as many as 180 bombs which would be dropped by belgian , german , italian , dutch , and turkish aircraft . us policy contravenes treaty according to the nrdc , this policy breaches international law because the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons -lrb- npt -rrb- prohibits a nuclear state from transferring nuclear weapons to a non-weapon state , and prohibits a non-nuclear state from receiving such weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean rocket " paektusan i , " is test launched in an undisclosed facility somewhere in north hamgyong province , north korea august 31 , 1998 .
the nrdc also claims that the mere presence of the weapons on european soil contradicts the npt by providing non-nuclear states with weapons protection under a us nuclear umbrella . " the continuing presence of these weapons irritates relations with russia , undermines global efforts to dissuade other nations from developing nuclear weapons , and impedes nato 's post-cold war evolution , " the nrdc states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial nukes decision remembered in the 1970s and 80s , when it seemed like the us and ussr might unleash a nuclear war in europe , “ no nukes ” was on every peace activist ’ s lips .

but with bush on the horizon , can europeans expect a real change in transatlantic relations ? the european union appears far better disposed towards the united states after us secretary of state condoleezza rice swept through the continent on a pre-summit charm offensive . but while the coolly sophisticated rice got on famously with everyone , it remains to be seen whether president george w. bush will find such a good personal rapport when he meets eu and nato leaders here on february 21 . even as the two sides try to move on from their divisions over the us-led war in iraq , new sources of discomfort are in the offing in the shape of iran and china . however , rice and her eu interlocutors were at pains to stress that a new chapter is at hand after the iraq conflict badly frayed transatlantic relations . europe ready to do business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice addresses european intellectuals on u.s. foreign policy in the world , at paris science politique institute , tuesday , feb .
8 , 2005 .
speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .
this to my mind is the most important conclusion from the trip , " he said . the tide appears to be slowly turning .
through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .
" last month 's elections in iraq have helped the momentum .
there 's no point in arguing about the war any more as everyone agrees that we have to win the peace , " he told afp . simmering difficulties remain " this is all well and good , and sets things up nicely for the bush visit .
but there are a number of issues still simmering under the surface , not least china .
and iran could be even more divisive than iraq , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
the eu 's intention to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo against china provided one cause of dissent during rice 's talks in europe .
us suspicions about iran 's nuclear programme provided another , with rice warning the heavyweight eu trio of britain , france and germany not to be too forgiving in their nuclear negotiations with the islamic regime . those issues , along with climate change and perennial trade disputes , will no doubt be prominent when president bush comes to brussels later this month on his first overseas visit since beginning his second term . he will as ever enjoy a warm welcome from british prime minister tony blair .
what will be more intriguing is how bush gets on with french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but there at least the rice tour has done much to smooth the way . condi the difference for jacques , gerd " chirac and schröder have indicated they want to do business with bush .
and for them , doing business with rice has been different to doing business with colin powell .
they know that she has the ear of the president , which makes all the difference , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indeed , rice got a dose of french charm in return during a stop in paris when chirac showered praise on a keynote speech she gave pledging a new page in transatlantic ties . but as a senior state department official noted : " one swallow does n't make a spring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers call the bombing a war crime against germans on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .

thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .

but jürgen klinsmann 's squad gave up the lead twice and settled with a tie against argentina wednesday night . germany 's miserable run against top nations continues as argentina twice came from behind to net a 2:2 draw in the international friendly in düsseldorf .
the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .
" it is disappointing to concede right at the end , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" but i am happy with how we played and feel we are moving in the right direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd schneider , center challenges for the ball with aldo pedro duscher , left , and juan pablo sorin , right , during the friendly match against argentina the germans played the better first half against the team klinsmann called " possibly the best team in the world at the moment . "
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .
penalties come in twos on the other side of the pitch , jens lehmann , who started in goal for germany while oliver kahn watched from the sidelines , faced a penalty kick duel of his own .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's keeper jens lehmann fails to catch the 1-1 penalty wednesday night juan pablo sorin was chopped down by a cluster of defenders in what looked like a fair challenge to the upset german bench .
ac milan striker hernan crespo drilled the kick home , scoring his first of two goals on the night in the 40th minute .
" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .

spectacular lob draws score the trickery of saviola and villareal playmaker juan roman riquelme was a delight for the capacity 52,000 fans but not german defenders perplexed by their nimble footwork .
" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .
the south american team 's attacking quality is undoubtedly their strength and in the 81st minute a brilliant move carved the german defense apart .
a quickly taken free-kick released crespo and he produced a majestic lob over lehmann to equalize . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann aims to break germany 's curse it 's been four years since germany beat any of world soccer 's top teams .

" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .

charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .

the last time germany beat a soccer world power was a 1:0 win against england in october 2000 .

"
bayern munich defender torsten frings placed a large role in controlling the game 's pace and converted a penalty kick against argentine keeper roberto abbondanzieri to give the hosts the lead in the 28th minute .
italian referee stefano farina awarded the spot kick after german striker kevin kuranyi collapsed in a heap following a corner kick challenge .

" the determination of both sides was there for all to see , " said argentina coach jose pekerman .
" it was two of the world 's most successful footballing nations out there and both sides came out of the game with credit . "
wanting to go to the locker room enjoying a goal lead , kuranyi collected a pass from bastian schweinsteiger and put a well-aimed shot under the argentine goalie in the first half 's dying seconds .
argentines stronger in second half the break gave the argentine team some time to get over their jet-lag and it came out strong in the second half , and especially impressed the german defense in the match 's final 20 minutes .
immediately after the break olympic champions argentina almost equalized with manchester united defender gabriel heinze spurning a great chance , heading over the crossbar when left unmarked in the center of goal .

spectacular lob draws score the trickery of saviola and villareal playmaker juan roman riquelme was a delight for the capacity 52,000 fans but not german defenders perplexed by their nimble footwork .
" argentina really turned on the style in the final 20 minutes , " klinsmann said .

he said germany must think about its children . speaking at the christian socialist union conference in the bavarian town of passau , party leader stoiber , said he was concerned about the well-being of children being brought up by same-sex parents .
" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "
he went on to dispute the ruling coalition 's justification to legalise gay adoption on the grounds that almost a quarter of gay and lesbians in germany wanted to have children .
" we are not talking here about self-realization of gays or lesbians , " he said .
no equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that " the discrimination of homosexual couples has to be consigned to history , " but the csu is opposed to granting homosexual couples equality with heterosexual relationships .
at the end of last year , the government approved amendments introduced by justice minister brigitte zypries to the partnership law of 2001 which first introduced " gay marriage " to germany .
if unthwarted by the bavarian conservatives ' plans to block the bill , it would allow homosexuals to adopt the biological child of their partner , if the other biological parent consents .
if the amendments are passed by parliament , gay and lesbian " registered couples " will enjoy most of the same rights and responsibilities heterosexual spouses do , including pension rights and financial support responsibilities in the event of separation .

but with bush on the horizon , can europeans expect a real change in transatlantic relations ? the european union appears far better disposed towards the united states after us secretary of state condoleezza rice swept through the continent on a pre-summit charm offensive . but while the coolly sophisticated rice got on famously with everyone , it remains to be seen whether president george w. bush will find such a good personal rapport when he meets eu and nato leaders here on february 21 . even as the two sides try to move on from their divisions over the us-led war in iraq , new sources of discomfort are in the offing in the shape of iran and china . however , rice and her eu interlocutors were at pains to stress that a new chapter is at hand after the iraq conflict badly frayed transatlantic relations . europe ready to do business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice addresses european intellectuals on u.s. foreign policy in the world , at paris science politique institute , tuesday , feb .
8 , 2005 .
speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .

but with bush on the horizon , can europeans expect a real change in transatlantic relations ? the european union appears far better disposed towards the united states after us secretary of state condoleezza rice swept through the continent on a pre-summit charm offensive . but while the coolly sophisticated rice got on famously with everyone , it remains to be seen whether president george w. bush will find such a good personal rapport when he meets eu and nato leaders here on february 21 . even as the two sides try to move on from their divisions over the us-led war in iraq , new sources of discomfort are in the offing in the shape of iran and china . however , rice and her eu interlocutors were at pains to stress that a new chapter is at hand after the iraq conflict badly frayed transatlantic relations . europe ready to do business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice addresses european intellectuals on u.s. foreign policy in the world , at paris science politique institute , tuesday , feb .

speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .

the end is nigh for an antiquated system that ran counter to efficiency . after two solid days of talks behind closed doors and two drawn-out years of negotiations between employer groups and unions , the deal will not only establish a 39-hour work week for federal employees throughout the country , with local government workers given the possibility of agreeing to the same terms , but it will extensively and radically reform the current wage system , according to german interior minister otto schily . " what we 've agreed upon is a remarkable piece of reform , " schily said .
" we 're replacing an out-of-date pay system and will radically modernize it with this agreement . " negotiators say the deal is a turning point that will strengthen the public sector 's efficiency .
the term ' efficiency ' may be considered synonymous with germany , but workers in the public sector here have a different reputation - as a result of the numerous benefits they receive , including automatic allowances based on age or marital status and subsidized wedding costs . the reforms include promoting employee productivity , more flexible work times and bringing into line the hours worked in the country 's east and west .
the work week had previously been 38.5 hours in the western part of germany and 40 hours in the former german democratic republic . avoiding privatization chief negotiator thomas böhle , from the employers ' association , said reaching the deal was n't easy , but it 's proof of a good working relationship between the parties involved . " we worked together extremely well and made some real progress towards the very end of the talks , " he said .
" and one giant step was managing to prevent the further privatization of public services . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske -lrb- r . -rrb- and interior minister otto schily announced the deal wednesday .
although compromises were made by both the employer groups and union bosses involved in what they described as " intense " negotiations , both sides signaled a positive result .
frank bsirske , head of the verdi services union , said that besides simplifying the pay structure , the new measures will also make the sector more attractive to younger workers by increasing pay for career beginners . " in my opinion , what we have here is a rounded concept , laying the foundations for the future - with considerably more value placed on performance-related pay , " bsirske said . the new model is expected to come into effect by october and will apply for civil servants on a federal and local level for the next three years .

but with bush on the horizon , can europeans expect a real change in transatlantic relations ? the european union appears far better disposed towards the united states after us secretary of state condoleezza rice swept through the continent on a pre-summit charm offensive . but while the coolly sophisticated rice got on famously with everyone , it remains to be seen whether president george w. bush will find such a good personal rapport when he meets eu and nato leaders here on february 21 . even as the two sides try to move on from their divisions over the us-led war in iraq , new sources of discomfort are in the offing in the shape of iran and china . however , rice and her eu interlocutors were at pains to stress that a new chapter is at hand after the iraq conflict badly frayed transatlantic relations . europe ready to do business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice addresses european intellectuals on u.s. foreign policy in the world , at paris science politique institute , tuesday , feb .
8 , 2005 .
speaking thursday in luxembourg as she wrapped up her week-long tour , rice said bush could now be sure of a " constructive , warm atmosphere in which everyone is ready to look well beyond the disagreements we may have had " .
rice came to a europe that appeared already in a mood to do business with bush as he gets down to work in his second and final term . eu foreign policy chief javier solana was more than happy to echo the message .
" she has deepened her friendship with old friends , and i am sure she has made many new friends in europe , " he said alongside rice . solana urges for more cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana shows condoleezza rice an old european custom .
solana said the eu and washington must move on from their feuding of the past two years and work together , in the middle east , in afghanistan , in the balkans and elsewhere .
" with our cooperation , there will be a better world .
this to my mind is the most important conclusion from the trip , " he said . the tide appears to be slowly turning .
through the nato military alliance , france and germany have swallowed some of their anger over the us-led intervention in iraq by agreeing to train iraqi security forces , albeit outside the country itself . nato itself is preparing to take on a bigger peacekeeping role in afghanistan , a key us objective to ease strains on stretched american troop levels worldwide .
following talks with rice at alliance headquarters on the outskirts of brussels , nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer said that relations between the united states and its european allies have " turned a corner " . asselborn seduced by rice charm luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn , representing the eu 's current presidency , said his own meeting with rice had been marked by an " excellent ambience " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn .
" i can safely assure you that today the transatlantic relationship , which has known , we all know , more difficult times months and years ago , is today very strong , " he said . warm words , perhaps .
but according to daniel keohane of the centre for european reform in london , the harmonious " mood music " now is infinitely preferable to the discordant jibes traded over iraq .
" last month 's elections in iraq have helped the momentum .
there 's no point in arguing about the war any more as everyone agrees that we have to win the peace , " he told afp . simmering difficulties remain " this is all well and good , and sets things up nicely for the bush visit .
but there are a number of issues still simmering under the surface , not least china .
and iran could be even more divisive than iraq , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mohammad khatami , right , shakes hands with french foreign minister , dominique de villepin , as british foreign minister , jack straw , looks on .
the eu 's intention to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo against china provided one cause of dissent during rice 's talks in europe .
us suspicions about iran 's nuclear programme provided another , with rice warning the heavyweight eu trio of britain , france and germany not to be too forgiving in their nuclear negotiations with the islamic regime . those issues , along with climate change and perennial trade disputes , will no doubt be prominent when president bush comes to brussels later this month on his first overseas visit since beginning his second term . he will as ever enjoy a warm welcome from british prime minister tony blair .
what will be more intriguing is how bush gets on with french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but there at least the rice tour has done much to smooth the way . condi the difference for jacques , gerd " chirac and schröder have indicated they want to do business with bush .
and for them , doing business with rice has been different to doing business with colin powell .
they know that she has the ear of the president , which makes all the difference , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indeed , rice got a dose of french charm in return during a stop in paris when chirac showered praise on a keynote speech she gave pledging a new page in transatlantic ties . but as a senior state department official noted : " one swallow does n't make a spring .

the eu 's intention to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo against china provided one cause of dissent during rice 's talks in europe .
us suspicions about iran 's nuclear programme provided another , with rice warning the heavyweight eu trio of britain , france and germany not to be too forgiving in their nuclear negotiations with the islamic regime . those issues , along with climate change and perennial trade disputes , will no doubt be prominent when president bush comes to brussels later this month on his first overseas visit since beginning his second term . he will as ever enjoy a warm welcome from british prime minister tony blair .
what will be more intriguing is how bush gets on with french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but there at least the rice tour has done much to smooth the way . condi the difference for jacques , gerd " chirac and schröder have indicated they want to do business with bush .
and for them , doing business with rice has been different to doing business with colin powell .
they know that she has the ear of the president , which makes all the difference , " keohane said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indeed , rice got a dose of french charm in return during a stop in paris when chirac showered praise on a keynote speech she gave pledging a new page in transatlantic ties . but as a senior state department official noted : " one swallow does n't make a spring .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " let 's leave that up to the conscience of the pope , " said sodano , who in the past dismissed talk of papal retirement .
" we have to have enormous faith in him .
he knows what he has to do . "
just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .
" he is seen as always taking the conservative orthodox course . "
willing to take interim post bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think of ratzinger -lrb- next to pope -rrb- as a top conservative papal candidate as head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which oversees moral and theological issues , all of ratzinger 's key decisions received the pontiff 's blessing , leading some to call him " john paul iii " the bavarian cardinal is against allowing priests to marry and has taken a hard line against abortion .
while it remains bad form to talk of the next pope in rome , dionigi tettamanzi , archbishop of milan ; francis arinze of nigeria ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , archbishop of tegucigalpa in honduras ; and angelo scola , another italian , the patriarch of venice are also seen to be in the unofficial running for the pontiff position .
as the pews in europe and north america remain empty , some observers have said a pontiff from africa or latin america would be a sign that the church is moving with the times .
possibly as a way of pleasing his supporters and calming his foes , ratzinger himself has said if he were to become pontiff , he would be prepared " to give up the job after a few years .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .

four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .

while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger . for the first time in 26 years the pope did not celebrate ash wednesday mass , yet again ratcheting up speculation concerning who will follow him and when .
vatican officials said thursday that john paul ii had recovered from his recent illness and was being released from hospital .
but the pope 's ailing health has still caused high-ranking church leaders to think about his succession .
his top aide , angelo sodano , broke with official vatican policy and openly addressed the possibility that the pope might retire if he felt he could not run the church .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph ratzinger " let 's leave that up to the conscience of the pope , " said sodano , who in the past dismissed talk of papal retirement .
" we have to have enormous faith in him .
he knows what he has to do . "
just what is " papable ? "
in his 24 years as one of the vatican 's leading men , ratzinger was n't what many called pope material .
but as the catholic church looks back at john paul 's 26 years of leadership , the church is split on just what is " papable . "
at 77 years old , ratzinger 's age is one of his biggest advantages .
some in the church believe after a quarter century with a single pontiff , a transitional pope might be a change for the positive .
vatican moderates fear ratzinger would continue karol wojtyla 's conservative style .
" cardinal ratzinger has been seen as a very important figure in the vatican for many years , but also as a polarizing one , a figure who brings splits , " said pope biographer marco politi .

“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

10 - 20 , is now a must - along with cannes and venice .
it was n't always this way .
on the european scene , the milan-based film market , mifed , used to be stronger competition for berlin .
but when the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved its date from february to november , industry insiders heard the death knell for october 's mifed . according to the hollywood reporter , buyers felt the milan market offered a poor return .
the afm 's date swap has not only lent berlin a higher profile , it has also removed scheduling conflicts for buyers wanting to attend the berlinale 's sister event , the european film market . " i 'll be going to berlin for seven days , whereas in the past , i 'd only go if i had a film in the festival selection , " jean labadie , head of french distributor bac films told the hollywood reporter . star attraction more buyers might be winging their way to berlin this year , but what about the stars ?
after all , the number of big name celebrities in attendance is a key factor in a festival 's success .
there have been worries that the timing of the oscar nominations could result in fewer stars gracing the red carpet at the berlinale . in the past , oscar nominees were announced during the berlinale , making the festival a perfect stage for academy award-hopefuls .
last year , however , was the first year that the oscars took place a month earlier than usual .
the nominees , consequently , were announced earlier , and suddenly , high-voltage celebrities such as nicole kidman failed to show .
this year , though , promises to be different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter kosslick " there were people who were worrying about whether , after this thing with the oscars , anyone would come along , " berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a press conference , a big grin on his face . the reason ?
he 'd just finished reeling off a list of dozens of celebrities expected to crowd the main venue at potsdamer platz this year .
it included keanu reeves , will smith , kevin spacey , daniel day-lewis , catherine deneuve , joseph fiennes , glenn close , and gerard depardieu .
the glamor factor , it seems , is a sure thing . and yet , kosslick said he 's not even that concerned about the number of stars who come to berlin .
this year , hollywood films , he said , make up only two to three percent of the 343 films being screened .
in his view , the berlinale is a political film festival .
he cited the fact that 10 years after the genocide in rwanda , two of the competition films this year focus on what happened there . indeed , the berlinale has garnered a reputation among industry executives as a quality market , albeit a euro-centric one .
translated into hollywood-speak , that means it 's not the place to buy popular , blockbuster material .
but that does n't bother kosslick . " we do n't want to be the biggest festival in the world , because we already are , " he said , referring to the fact that the berlinale plays to the largest audience of any film festival in the world .

after all , the number of big name celebrities in attendance is a key factor in a festival 's success .
there have been worries that the timing of the oscar nominations could result in fewer stars gracing the red carpet at the berlinale . in the past , oscar nominees were announced during the berlinale , making the festival a perfect stage for academy award-hopefuls .

it included keanu reeves , will smith , kevin spacey , daniel day-lewis , catherine deneuve , joseph fiennes , glenn close , and gerard depardieu .
the glamor factor , it seems , is a sure thing . and yet , kosslick said he 's not even that concerned about the number of stars who come to berlin .
this year , hollywood films , he said , make up only two to three percent of the 343 films being screened .

he said germany must think about its children . speaking at the christian socialist union conference in the bavarian town of passau , party leader stoiber , said he was concerned about the well-being of children being brought up by same-sex parents .
" the red-green coalition wants to give same-sex partners the right to adopt children , " stoiber said .
" we will call on the german constitutional court to establish whether that is in keeping with our constitution . "
he went on to dispute the ruling coalition 's justification to legalise gay adoption on the grounds that almost a quarter of gay and lesbians in germany wanted to have children .
" we are not talking here about self-realization of gays or lesbians , " he said .
no equality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed that " the discrimination of homosexual couples has to be consigned to history , " but the csu is opposed to granting homosexual couples equality with heterosexual relationships .
at the end of last year , the government approved amendments introduced by justice minister brigitte zypries to the partnership law of 2001 which first introduced " gay marriage " to germany .
if unthwarted by the bavarian conservatives ' plans to block the bill , it would allow homosexuals to adopt the biological child of their partner , if the other biological parent consents .
if the amendments are passed by parliament , gay and lesbian " registered couples " will enjoy most of the same rights and responsibilities heterosexual spouses do , including pension rights and financial support responsibilities in the event of separation .
the governing social democratic-green coalition also wants to introduce gay engagements , which would allow one partner to refuse to testify against the other in court . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay marriage upsets spain 's catholic church a spanish bill allowing gay marriage is expected to go to parliament has the catholic church up in arms .

but when the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved its date from february to november , industry insiders heard the death knell for october 's mifed . according to the hollywood reporter , buyers felt the milan market offered a poor return .
the afm 's date swap has not only lent berlin a higher profile , it has also removed scheduling conflicts for buyers wanting to attend the berlinale 's sister event , the european film market . " i 'll be going to berlin for seven days , whereas in the past , i 'd only go if i had a film in the festival selection , " jean labadie , head of french distributor bac films told the hollywood reporter . star attraction more buyers might be winging their way to berlin this year , but what about the stars ?
after all , the number of big name celebrities in attendance is a key factor in a festival 's success .
there have been worries that the timing of the oscar nominations could result in fewer stars gracing the red carpet at the berlinale . in the past , oscar nominees were announced during the berlinale , making the festival a perfect stage for academy award-hopefuls .
last year , however , was the first year that the oscars took place a month earlier than usual .
the nominees , consequently , were announced earlier , and suddenly , high-voltage celebrities such as nicole kidman failed to show .
this year , though , promises to be different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter kosslick " there were people who were worrying about whether , after this thing with the oscars , anyone would come along , " berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a press conference , a big grin on his face . the reason ?
he 'd just finished reeling off a list of dozens of celebrities expected to crowd the main venue at potsdamer platz this year .
it included keanu reeves , will smith , kevin spacey , daniel day-lewis , catherine deneuve , joseph fiennes , glenn close , and gerard depardieu .
the glamor factor , it seems , is a sure thing . and yet , kosslick said he 's not even that concerned about the number of stars who come to berlin .
this year , hollywood films , he said , make up only two to three percent of the 343 films being screened .
in his view , the berlinale is a political film festival .
he cited the fact that 10 years after the genocide in rwanda , two of the competition films this year focus on what happened there . indeed , the berlinale has garnered a reputation among industry executives as a quality market , albeit a euro-centric one .
translated into hollywood-speak , that means it 's not the place to buy popular , blockbuster material .
but that does n't bother kosslick . " we do n't want to be the biggest festival in the world , because we already are , " he said , referring to the fact that the berlinale plays to the largest audience of any film festival in the world .

10 - 20 , is now a must - along with cannes and venice .
it was n't always this way .
on the european scene , the milan-based film market , mifed , used to be stronger competition for berlin .
but when the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved its date from february to november , industry insiders heard the death knell for october 's mifed . according to the hollywood reporter , buyers felt the milan market offered a poor return .
the afm 's date swap has not only lent berlin a higher profile , it has also removed scheduling conflicts for buyers wanting to attend the berlinale 's sister event , the european film market . " i 'll be going to berlin for seven days , whereas in the past , i 'd only go if i had a film in the festival selection , " jean labadie , head of french distributor bac films told the hollywood reporter . star attraction more buyers might be winging their way to berlin this year , but what about the stars ?
after all , the number of big name celebrities in attendance is a key factor in a festival 's success .
there have been worries that the timing of the oscar nominations could result in fewer stars gracing the red carpet at the berlinale . in the past , oscar nominees were announced during the berlinale , making the festival a perfect stage for academy award-hopefuls .
last year , however , was the first year that the oscars took place a month earlier than usual .
the nominees , consequently , were announced earlier , and suddenly , high-voltage celebrities such as nicole kidman failed to show .
this year , though , promises to be different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter kosslick " there were people who were worrying about whether , after this thing with the oscars , anyone would come along , " berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a press conference , a big grin on his face . the reason ?
he 'd just finished reeling off a list of dozens of celebrities expected to crowd the main venue at potsdamer platz this year .
it included keanu reeves , will smith , kevin spacey , daniel day-lewis , catherine deneuve , joseph fiennes , glenn close , and gerard depardieu .
the glamor factor , it seems , is a sure thing . and yet , kosslick said he 's not even that concerned about the number of stars who come to berlin .
this year , hollywood films , he said , make up only two to three percent of the 343 films being screened .
in his view , the berlinale is a political film festival .
he cited the fact that 10 years after the genocide in rwanda , two of the competition films this year focus on what happened there . indeed , the berlinale has garnered a reputation among industry executives as a quality market , albeit a euro-centric one .
translated into hollywood-speak , that means it 's not the place to buy popular , blockbuster material .
but that does n't bother kosslick . " we do n't want to be the biggest festival in the world , because we already are , " he said , referring to the fact that the berlinale plays to the largest audience of any film festival in the world .

10 - 20 , is now a must - along with cannes and venice .
it was n't always this way .
on the european scene , the milan-based film market , mifed , used to be stronger competition for berlin .
but when the american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moved its date from february to november , industry insiders heard the death knell for october 's mifed . according to the hollywood reporter , buyers felt the milan market offered a poor return .
the afm 's date swap has not only lent berlin a higher profile , it has also removed scheduling conflicts for buyers wanting to attend the berlinale 's sister event , the european film market . " i 'll be going to berlin for seven days , whereas in the past , i 'd only go if i had a film in the festival selection , " jean labadie , head of french distributor bac films told the hollywood reporter . star attraction more buyers might be winging their way to berlin this year , but what about the stars ?
after all , the number of big name celebrities in attendance is a key factor in a festival 's success .
there have been worries that the timing of the oscar nominations could result in fewer stars gracing the red carpet at the berlinale . in the past , oscar nominees were announced during the berlinale , making the festival a perfect stage for academy award-hopefuls .
last year , however , was the first year that the oscars took place a month earlier than usual .
the nominees , consequently , were announced earlier , and suddenly , high-voltage celebrities such as nicole kidman failed to show .
this year , though , promises to be different . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter kosslick " there were people who were worrying about whether , after this thing with the oscars , anyone would come along , " berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a press conference , a big grin on his face . the reason ?
he 'd just finished reeling off a list of dozens of celebrities expected to crowd the main venue at potsdamer platz this year .
it included keanu reeves , will smith , kevin spacey , daniel day-lewis , catherine deneuve , joseph fiennes , glenn close , and gerard depardieu .
the glamor factor , it seems , is a sure thing . and yet , kosslick said he 's not even that concerned about the number of stars who come to berlin .
this year , hollywood films , he said , make up only two to three percent of the 343 films being screened .
in his view , the berlinale is a political film festival .
he cited the fact that 10 years after the genocide in rwanda , two of the competition films this year focus on what happened there . indeed , the berlinale has garnered a reputation among industry executives as a quality market , albeit a euro-centric one .
translated into hollywood-speak , that means it 's not the place to buy popular , blockbuster material .
but that does n't bother kosslick . " we do n't want to be the biggest festival in the world , because we already are , " he said , referring to the fact that the berlinale plays to the largest audience of any film festival in the world .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .

thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .

fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers call the bombing a war crime against germans on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .
the country has to seriously address that , if it 's not already too late .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2005 the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers call the bombing a war crime against germans on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .
but they are using this to take advantage of what i call as latent explosive potential that exists in the region .
the country has to seriously address that , if it 's not already too late . " kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

" mrs parker bowles and i are absolutely delighted .
it will be a very special day for us and our families ' , " said charles , 56 , before going out to look at wedding rings in london 's financial district .
clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .
" she is no comparison to diana , " he added .

clarence house said the wedding would be " a largely private occasion for family and friends " in marked contrast to charles 's gala wedding to diana at st paul 's cathedral in july 1981 .
happy reaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is reportedly delighted at the news in a statement , queen elizabeth ii said : " the duke of edinburgh -lrb- prince philip -rrb- and i are very happy that the prince of wales and mrs parker bowles are to marry . "
" we have given them our warmest good wishes for their future together . "
charles 's sons by his marriage to diana , who died in a car crash in paris in 1997 , prince william , 22 , and 20-year-old prince harry , were also " delighted " , royal officials said .
news of the engagement ended years of speculation as to whether the heir to the throne would - or could - ever tie the knot with parker bowles , who is notably less popular with the british public than the more glamorous diana .
clarence house said parker bowles , 57 , would not be called queen once charles becomes king but would be known as the princess consort .
after her marriage she will also carry the title of duchess of cornwall .
no religious ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the couple will have a civil ceremony the fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a nod to the church of england , which does not recognise marriage between divorcees .
both the prince , who as king will be the supreme governor of the church of england , and parker bowles are divorced .
nonetheless , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams said he supported the union , which was " consistent with church of england guidelines concerning remarriage " .
although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for a british prince , there are no constitutional barriers.the only laws governing royal weddings , both from the 18th century , say only that they must have the monarch 's consent and that the proposed spouse is not roman catholic , neither of which are issues in this case .
public perceptions far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the british public .
many consider parker bowles to blame for the break-up of the marriage of charles and diana , who divorced in 1996 .
diana , who remains extremely popular almost eight years after her death , famously quipped that there were " three people " in her marriage .
while she is reportedly charming and lively in person , parker bowles is a much more aloof figure than diana was , with little apparent interest in her public image and a fashion sense largely shaped by her outdoor country life . " obviously people 's feelings about camilla are very much entangled to those of diana , " said royal biographer robert lacey .
" it is pretty clear that people are not enormously enamoured by camilla .
people in the future will say that when you compare her style with diana 's , it is very different . "
charles first met parker bowles in 1970 , but their relationship ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor , army officer andrew parker bowles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william and harry will gain a step mother although this first marriage lasted until 1995 , parker bowles continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to diana , a long love affair cemented by a mutual love of country pursuits such as polo and fox hunting .
on the streets of london , many people accepted the prospect of the union , but without apparent joy .
" it is about time they got married as he was obviously never going to give her up , " said arthur mills , 69 , a retiree shopping along london 's bond street with his wife jane , who nodded her head in agreement .

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .

a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .

the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation . no one denies that the near total destruction of this beautiful , baroque city - once called the florence on the elbe - was a calamity .
but a debate has now been ignited by the right wing about whether it should be primarily seen as a catastrophe germany brought upon itself , or as the wanton , senseless killing of civilians by enemies of the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : b-17 flying fortresses of the u.s. eighth air force 's third air division bomb german communications at chemnitz marshalling yard near dresden , germany , on feb .
6 , 1945 during world war ii .
cutting off the rail lines here aided in shutting off the flow of supplies to the german front .
thirteen hundred b-17 flying fortresses and b-24 liberators bombed this and many other industrial and rail targets throughout central germany .
the massive bombing raids carried out from feb .
13 to 14 by anglo-american forces turned around 85 percent of a city once considered one of the world 's most beautiful into a smoldering heap of ashes .
estimates of those killed range between 35,000 and 135,000 , yet the attacks , carried out when german forces were already on the retreat and the nation destined for defeat , achieved little militarily . the high numbers of dead civilians and the seeming pointlessness of the destruction enable right-wing extremists in germany to spread their xenophobic , revisionist message on the anniversary . right-wing hijacking ? members of the far right are threatening to upstage the official commemoration on sunday with demonstrations that could include up to 7,000 of their supporters .
german media have said the neo-nazi march , organized by the country 's strongest extreme-right party , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , could be the largest since the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing demonstration it comes at a time when the nation as a whole is debating what to do about a recent upswing in the far-right 's political fortunes and visibility . " one thing german politicians do not want are images to be broadcast around the world of neo-nazis marching during commemorations of important war-time events , " said ulrich battis , a professor of law at berlin 's humboldt university who studies the country 's far-right movement .
fears are high that banner-waving men with shaved heads taking over dresden 's old town on sunday as television cameras roll . officials worried about right-wingers stealing the spotlight have asked city residents to show their opposition to the far right and turn the occasion from a symbol of victimhood , to one of tyranny of nazi rule and the destruction it brought on its own citizens .
the city has asked people to wear a white rose in their lapel and to gather at theater square for a giant candlelit vigil on sunday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche , shortly before the completion of restoration work the main nave of the frauenkirche -lrb- photo -rrb- , dresden 's central cathedral , which was destroyed in the bombings and whose painstaking reconstruction was just completed last year , will be open to visitors for the first time , eight months before its consecration . officials hope it will serve as a symbol of reconciliation and forgiveness , and attract media attention away from the right-wingers .
they have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the cross on the church 's cupola was crafted by a silversmith from coventry , england , the son of a british pilot who took part in the bombing of the city . germany as victim while dresden was a city firmly behind the nazis during world war ii and was run by a party member , martin mutschmann , renowned for his brutality , the far right plans to focus only on the german victims during the rally .
some are worried that their portrayal of germany as victim will be an attractive message to many . " there are many more people today who subscribe to a very simple theory of victimhood and the npd is able to connect with these people , " said friedemann bringt , a project manager of the culture bureau of saxony , a group which organizes initiatives to stop the rise of the far right .
he said the " mourning marches " that right-wing extremists have held over the past five years on this anniversary have been increasingly well attended . " the number of older , ' normal ' citizens taking part is growing , " he said .
" it 's not just a march of neo-nazis and skinheads anymore . " according to bukart lutz , a sociology professor at the center for social research at the martin luther university in halle , the npd has been successful in capitalizing on two narratives , both having to do with victimhood , coursing through eastern germany now . one has to do with the bombing of a beautiful city with little strategic importance , and the images of charred corpses of women and children in piled in the streets .
an npd member of the state parliament last month called the attack a " bombing holocaust , " much to the horror of jewish leaders and mainstream politicians . the other is more contemporary .
eastern germany is the country 's poorest region , with unemployment surpassing 20 percent in some places and the outlook bleak for improvement in the near future .
young people have been especially hard hit .
with jobs in scarce supply , many have left for greener pastures in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of right-wingers celebrate a flag parade during a neo-nazi rally in the eastern german city of leipzig .
those who have remained , often alienated and with much hope , have proven fertile ground for those recruiting new adherents to the right-wing movement . add to that painful welfare and labor market reforms that are being particularly felt in the east , by people of all ages , and the message of victimhood the npd stresses starts to get through . possible violence officials are worried about possible violence on sunday as opposing groups try to get their own interpretation and political points of view across .
a loose coalition of left-wingers calling itself " no tears for krauts " has said it would " attack the nazis and the revisionism of the bourgeois mob . "
police say they expect some 1,000 anarchists to face around 5,000 far-right extremists , with up to 100,000 visitors to the official ceremonies in the middle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semper opera house in dresden although the topic of dresden is a sensitive one , according to sociologist lutz , for the right wing , it is not the unique symbol for their movement .
for the extremists , he said dresden is just a good occasion to continue sowing seeds on fertile ground . " it 's not a problem that is specific to dresden , rather a problem of east germany , " he said .
" it could be something completely different tomorrow .

while medical advances go to the limits of survival with extreme premature births , a new study shows few of these miracle babies develop normally .
in germany doctors face a tough decision : when to save life at all costs . rumaisa weighed just 244 grams when she was born last year in the us , and yet her birth had a heavy impact on the medical community : a new record for premature births was broken .
doctors had again proven that the boundary of life could be pushed back just a little further . every year , health professionals report an improved survival rate for extreme premature babies .
in germany , where advances in prenatal medicine keep apace with those in the us and the rest of the eu , there are some 70,000 premature births -lrb- approximately 10 percent of all births -rrb- , and of those one percent are classified as extreme . advances in modern medicine are keeping apace with the statistics .
just 20 years ago , babies born prior to the 28th week of pregnancy and under 1,000 grams -lrb- normal is 40 weeks and 3,500 grams -rrb- had little chance of surviving .
today the threshold is much earlier . babies on the edge of life in germany , the boundary is drawn at 24 weeks , said dr. heinz-peter groneck , deputy chairman of the association for neonatology and pediatric intensive medicine -lrb- gnpi -rrb- .
a child born after this point is entitled to the full spectrum of life-saving measures – even if that means going against the parents wishes – says the gnpi , which issues guidelines for obstetricians and pediatricians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the görsch quintets elias , kilian , finja , joshua und tabea spent 71 days in intensive care before going home .
but what kind of life can these babies expect after they ’ ve been rescued from the threshold of survival ? a recent long-term study published by researchers in the united kingdom and switzerland shows that only a handful of the extreme premies have a good chance of developing normally .
four out of five children born prior to the 26th week with 700 grams or less had developed physical or mental handicaps by their sixth year , some of them extreme and requiring life-long assistance . the study , conducted on some 4,000 premature births in britain and ireland in 1995 , is one of the first to highlight the long-term consequences of extreme prematurity , and some experts say given the statistics , the medical profession needs to reconsider its guidelines and its practice of saving lives at all costs . redrawing the boundaries dr. dieter wolke , development psychologist and one of the researchers involved in the study , said in a recent interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , doctors need to re-evaluate their criteria for saving extreme premature lives .
“ which quality of life these children can expect has not been examined enough , ” he said .
“ neonatology has pushed the limits of what is possible . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intensive care is sometimes needed for months after an extreme premature birth in other countries the medical community is more restrictive on applying intensive life-saving measures .
given the high rate of severe handicaps , switzerland has moved up the threshold by two weeks compared to germany , the netherlands by one . groeneck , who helps advise colleagues in such life or death matters , said a similar rule is not being considered in germany , nor is it something in his opinion the parents would want .
the discussion on when to do everything possible to save a baby must always take place on a case-by-case basis . mixed message that means the decision-making process is an extremely difficult one , said dr. anke rohde , director of the clinic for gynecological psychology in bonn , one of germany ’ s premier centers for extreme premature births .
moreover , the message the medical community is sending is a mixed one , she said . “ it is a schizophrenic situation , ” the psychologist said .
“ on the one side everything is being done to save children with just a slight chance of survival , and on the other , late term abortions are being conducted until the 24th week , because a child has a birth defect and is deemed to have little chance of leading a normal life . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 24th week of pregnancy marks the threshold to survivability the 24th week is indeed the “ meeting point between life and death , ” groneck acknowledged , and it ’ s still a grey zone in which doctors are operating .
there are no hard and fast rules to apply to all babies in all circumstances , the doctor conceded . saving lives – not at all costs “ this is medicine on the edge .
we are working on the boundaries , but we know where we are headed , ” groneck said .
the ideal is of course to save as many lives as possible with as few complications as possible , and not to continue pushing the boundary at all costs , he added . barbara grieb , who runs the information center at the german network for premature births , agreed .
“ doctors are not so unrealistic that they want to save children at all costs and under all circumstances .
they look at the individual child and the life signs and then decide . ” the recommendation of 24 weeks reflects what is possible , said grieb , herself the mother of a premature child .
but she also said the limit has been reached : “ there comes a point when medicine can not replace what the child would have gained in the uterus . ” kristin zeier , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : european court rules against fetus rights the european court of human rights has ruled that the involuntary abortion of a fetus does not constitute manslaughter , setting a precedent on the legal status of unborn babies that will be applied across europe .

plans produced by an international company show how the tax could work and how much the implementation of the scheme will cost .
the states employed company crown agents to come up with plans to cover the financial shortfall when a zero- rate corporation tax comes into force .
formal proposals for a goods and services tax are expected to be put to the states in the next few weeks .
the final report has taken three months to complete and steven lowthorpe , the company 's taxation director , says there will be other costs as well as those for setting the scheme up .
he said : " i think the big cost will be the recurrent expenditure .
" we 've recommended the income tax department would administer the goods and services tax -lrb- gst -rrb- , but we 've estimated it would probably mean 10 additional staff . "

more than 16,000 people in the uk are killed by bowel cancer each year .
around 2,500 volunteers are being sought to test the drug cetuximab , to be used alongside chemotherapy .
the uk-wide research , led by a professor at cardiff 's velindre hospital , will give doctors important information on how to treat sufferers .
the tests are being led by professor tim maughan , the director of wales cancer trials , with velindre , singleton , glan clwyd , and ysbyty gwynedd hospitals taking part .
prof maughan said : " cetuximab targets the cancer and appears to make standard chemotherapy much more effective .
" we want to find out if it can help patients to live longer and have a better quality of life . "
our main priority is to ensure that patients taking part in the trial receive the highest standard of support and care professor tim maughan professor maughan also said chemotherapy itself was being examined , with the aim of finding ways to make it less " arduous and tiring " for patients .
" we hope to discover that using chemotherapy intermittently will be as effective as the current continual treatment , meaning patients would be able to have a break from the treatment for recovery and holidays . "
the trial is designed for people who have metastatic colorectal cancer , which means it is bowel cancer which has spread to somewhere else in the body .
during the trials , researchers will be carrying out a range of tests on people 's blood and tumour samples .
the trial is being based at velindre hospital professor maughan said they then hoped " to see whether we can predict which patients will respond best to the treatment , and who might do better with an alternative approach " .
" our main priority is to ensure that patients taking part in the trial receive the highest standard of support and care , " he added .
jola gore-booth , of the charity colon cancer concer , said : " after nearly 50 years in which only one drug , 5fu , has been available in the treatment of advanced bowel cancer , it is very exciting that many more treatments , including cetuximab , are now able to be used to combat the disease . "
a spokesperson for the charity beating bowel cancer echoed this view .
" cetuximab is one of a number of exciting new treatment options for bowel cancer patients , which we hope will be a step towards saving lives from this disease . "
the research is being funded by the medical research council -lrb- mrc -rrb- and cancer research uk , with an educational grant from the pharmaceutical company , merck kgaa .
any patients who are interested in taking part in the trial should speak to the doctor treating them to see if they are eligible .

councillors in caerphilly agreed to remove all suntanning equipment at its premises throughout the county .
the authority said it had a duty to improve public health , and would be gradually phasing out all tanning facilities by march 2006 .
figures for the last financial year reveal that sunbeds operated by the council brought in £ 80,000 .
it will be looking for ways of replacing the lost revenue as the beds are withdrawn .
in the meantime , the council has assured the public that beds which are still being used will be " rigorously monitored " in keeping with guidelines issued by the institute of sport and recreation managers .
that will ensure that access to sunbeds was controlled and that no-one could be exposed to too much uv light .
" the council is promoting safe and healthy lifestyles for residents , " said david hardacre , deputy leader of the council and cabinet member for education and leisure .
sunbeds are often used as a shortcut to a tan " therefore we have taken the difficult decision to withdraw sunbeds . "
concerns about the safety of suntanning equipment - particularly research linking the use of sunbeds to skin cancer and other health problems - has prompted many local authorities across the uk to withdraw facilities .
in october 2003 , anglesey became the first county in wales to do so , and other councils have been seeking advice before they make a decision .
research carried out by the welsh local government association in 2003 found there was no common policy in wales for the removal of sunbeds .
of the 18 out of the 22 welsh authorities which responded , 17 still provided them , with anglesey being the only exception .
the majority had provided sunbeds for more than 10 years .
at the time , a third were removing them or were planning to do so .
the study showed that the revenue generated ranged from £ 6,000 to £ 123,000 a year , though more than half the authorities reported revenue had fallen in recent years .
aromatherapy three authorities said they were scaling down sunbeds by not renewing leases as they expired .
the phasing out meant that revenue from the beds was not suddenly lost , and it would be gradually replaced by revenue from other facilities introduced , like complementary health treatments including aromatherapy and massage .
in a report to caerphilly 's cabinet , director of education and leisure david hopkins pointed out that the chartered institute of environmental health had again raised the issue of the role of local government in protecting and improving public health , and had called on councils to phase out sunbeds .
also , he added : " the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- does not recommend the use of tanning devices for cosmetic purposes because of the potential risks to health associated with their use . "
the bma has warned that the use of sunbeds may result in " acute and chronic health effects " on the skin and eyes .
it recommends that sunbeds should never be used by people who : are under 16 years of age have very fair skin burn easily or tan poorly have a lot of freckles or moles have had skin cancer or a family history of the disease use medication which could make their skin more sensitive to ultra-violet rays -lrb- uvr -rrb- already have extensive skin damage from uvr e-mail this to a friend printable version bbc news : video and audio the bbc 's nicola carslaw " almost half of the salons visited belonged to the sunbed association " south east wales find out more about what is going on across the region see also : councils urged to ban sunbeds 21 sep 03 -pipe- health doctors warn against sunbed use 10 apr 03 -pipe- health q & a : sunbeds 22 sep 03 -pipe- health related bbc links : the science of sunshine related internet links : sunbed risks - british medical association sunbed association cancer research uk consumers ' association the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top south east wales stories jobs fear in companies house cuts tram driver summonsed over death daily new york flight talks ' end ' products and services e-mail news mobiles alerts news feeds podcasts news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health have your say -pipe- in pictures -pipe- week at a glance -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes bbc copyright notice mmx most popular now -pipe- 25,757 pages were read in the last minute .

education secretary ruth kelly is to reveal plans to tighten the health requirements for school meals .
parents will get more say on the quality of the food , she will reveal .
the food industry , schools and nutritionists will also be consulted on what should be on menus , which have been criticised as " unhealthy " .
bbc news : video and audio ruth kelly interview " it is important that parents have confidence in what goes on in the school kitchen , " ms kelly told the bbc .
" if there is a feeling among parents that they are not satisfied , they should be able to bring change and the school is supported in terms of bringing in change and making appropriate changes in training staff and offering an appropriate range of menus . "
the announcements come amid concerns over rising rates of childhood obesity .
after the consultations , the government says it will set up an independent " school food trust " to maintain standards .
fruit and veg the government has previously promised a " tougher minimum standard " for school meals from next year .
the country 's biggest union , unison - which represents many school cooks - welcomed the latest announcements .
its general secretary , dave prentis , said : " we know from our members who work in school kitchens that they are very worried about the poor quality of the food they are made to dish up .
" they know that given the choice children will make a beeline for the chips and burgers and we need to make sure that they are given healthy alternatives . "
but the shadow education secretary , tim collins , said : " this is beyond parody .
" labour wo n't let you choose your child 's school , but they want you to join a committee to discuss your child 's school dinners . "
a survey last year by the children 's charity barnardo 's found most pupils in england , wales and scotland accepted junk food as the " staple school diet " .
meanwhile , the soil association , which promotes organic farming , found " a typical " school meal - such as cheese fritters , roast potatoes , peas and flapjacks - every day provided 40 % more salt , 28 % more saturated fat and 20 % more sugar than recommended .
the results of the consultation with parents , schools , food activists and the food industry are expected to be published in april .

" if there is a feeling among parents that they are not satisfied , they should be able to bring change and the school is supported in terms of bringing in change and making appropriate changes in training staff and offering an appropriate range of menus . "
the announcements come amid concerns over rising rates of childhood obesity .
after the consultations , the government says it will set up an independent " school food trust " to maintain standards .
fruit and veg the government has previously promised a " tougher minimum standard " for school meals from next year .
the country 's biggest union , unison - which represents many school cooks - welcomed the latest announcements .
its general secretary , dave prentis , said : " we know from our members who work in school kitchens that they are very worried about the poor quality of the food they are made to dish up .
" they know that given the choice children will make a beeline for the chips and burgers and we need to make sure that they are given healthy alternatives . "
but the shadow education secretary , tim collins , said : " this is beyond parody .
" labour wo n't let you choose your child 's school , but they want you to join a committee to discuss your child 's school dinners . "
a survey last year by the children 's charity barnardo 's found most pupils in england , wales and scotland accepted junk food as the " staple school diet " .
meanwhile , the soil association , which promotes organic farming , found " a typical " school meal - such as cheese fritters , roast potatoes , peas and flapjacks - every day provided 40 % more salt , 28 % more saturated fat and 20 % more sugar than recommended .
the results of the consultation with parents , schools , food activists and the food industry are expected to be published in april .

north korea refers to itself as the democratic people 's republic of korea -lrb- dprk -rrb- .
pyongyang , february 10 -lrb- kcna -rrb- - the dprk ministry of foreign affairs released a statement thursday to clarify its stand to cope with the grave situation created by the us hostile policy toward the dprk .
the statement says : the second-term bush administration 's intention to antagonize the dprk and isolate and stifle it at any cost has become quite clear .
as we have clarified more than once , we justly urged the us to renounce its hostile policy toward the dprk whose aim was to seek the latter 's " regime change " and switch its policy to that of peaceful co-existence between the two countries .
we have closely followed with patience what policy the second-term bush regime would shape after clarifying the stand that in that case it would be possible to solve the nuclear issue , too .
however , the administration turned down our just request and adopted it as its policy not to co-exist with the dprk through the president 's inaugural address and the state of the union address and the speech made by the secretary of state at the congress hearing to get its approval , etc .
the remarks made by senior officials of the administration clarifying the official political stance of the us contained no word showing any willingness to co-exist with the dprk or make a switchover in its policy toward it .
on the contrary , they have declared it as their final goal to terminate the tyranny , defined the dprk , too , as an " outpost of tyranny " and blustered that they would not rule out the use of force when necessary .
and they pledged to build a world based on the us view on value through the " spread of american style liberty and democracy . "
the true intention of the second-term bush administration is not only to further its policy to isolate and stifle the dprk pursued by the first-term office but to escalate it .
as seen above , the us has declared a new ideological stand-off aimed at a " regime change " in the dprk while talking much about " peaceful and diplomatic solution " to the nuclear issue and the " resumption of the six-party talks " in a bid to mislead the world public opinion .
this is nothing but a far-fetched logic of gangsters as it is a good example fully revealing the wicked nature and brazen-faced double-dealing tactics of the u.s. as a master hand at plot-breeding and deception .
the dprk has clarified its stand that it would not pursue anti-americanism and treat the us as a friendly nation if it neither slanders the political system in the dprk nor interferes in its internal affairs .
it has since made every possible effort to settle the nuclear issue and improve the bilateral relations .
however , the us interpreted this as a sign of weakness , defiled the dignified political system in the dprk chosen by its people and wantonly interfered in its internal affairs .
the us , turning down the dprk 's request to roll back its anti-dprk hostile policy , a major stumbling block in the way of settling the nuclear issue , treated it as an enemy and , not content with this , totally rejected it , terming it " tyranny . "
this deprived the dprk of any justification to negotiate with the u.s. and participate in the six-party talks .
is it not self-contradictory and unreasonable for the us to urge the dprk to come out to the talks while negating its dialogue partner ?
this is the height of impudence .
the us now foolishly claims to stand by the people in the dprk while negating the government chosen by the people themselves .
we advise the us to negotiate with dealers in peasant markets it claims they are to its liking or with representatives of " the organization of north korean defectors " on its payroll if it wishes to hold talks .
japan is now persistently pursuing its hostile policy toward the dprk , toeing the us line .
moreover , it fabricated the issue of false remains over the " abduction issue " that had already been settled in a bid to nullify the dprk-japan pyongyang declaration and stop any process to normalize diplomatic relations with the dprk .
how can we sit at the negotiating table with such a party ?
it is the trend of the new century and wish of humankind to go in for peace , co-existence and prosperity irrespective of differing ideology , system and religious belief .
it is by no means fortuitous that the world people raise their voices cursing and censuring the bush administration as a group pursuing tyranny prompted by its extreme misanthropy , swimming against such trend of the world .
we have shown utmost magnanimity and patience for the past four years since the first bush administration swore in .
we can not spend another four years as we did in the past four years and there is no need for us to repeat what we did in those years .
the dprk foreign ministry clarifies as following to cope with the grave situation created by the us hostile policy toward the dprk : first .
we have wanted the six-party talks but we are compelled to suspend our participation in the talks for an indefinite period till we have recognized that there is justification for us to attend the talks and there are ample conditions and atmosphere to expect positive results from the talks .
the present deadlock of the six-party talks is attributable to the us hostile policy toward the dprk .
there is no justification for us to participate in the six-party talks again given that the bush administration termed the dprk , a dialogue partner , an " outpost of tyranny " , putting into the shade the hostile policy , and totally negated it .
second .
the us disclosed its attempt to topple the political system in the dprk at any cost , threatening it with a nuclear stick .
this compels us to take a measure to bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal in order to protect the ideology , system , freedom and democracy chosen by its people .
it is the spirit of the korean people true to the songun politics to respond to good faith and the use of force in kind .
we had already taken the resolute action of pulling out of the npt and have manufactured nukes for self-defence to cope with the bush administration 's evermore undisguised policy to isolate and stifle the dprk .
its nuclear weapons will remain nuclear deterrent for self-defence under any circumstances .
the present reality proves that only powerful strength can protect justice and truth .
the us evermore reckless moves and attempt to attack the dprk only reinforce its pride of having already consolidated the single-minded unity of the army and people and increased the capability for self-defence under the uplifted banner of songun .
the dprk 's principled stand to solve the issue through dialogue and negotiations and its ultimate goal to denuclearize the korean peninsula remain unchanged .

education secretary ruth kelly is to reveal plans to tighten the health requirements for school meals .
parents will get more say on the quality of the food , she will reveal .
the food industry , schools and nutritionists will also be consulted on what should be on menus , which have been criticised as " unhealthy " .
" it is important that parents have confidence in what goes on in the school kitchen , " ms kelly told the bbc .
" if there is a feeling among parents that they are not satisfied , they should be able to bring change and the school is supported in terms of bringing in change and making appropriate changes in training staff and offering an appropriate range of menus . "
the announcements come amid concerns over rising rates of childhood obesity .
after the consultations , the government says it will set up an independent " school food trust " to maintain standards .
fruit and veg the government has previously promised a " tougher minimum standard " for school meals from next year .
the country 's biggest union , unison - which represents many school cooks - welcomed the latest announcements .
its general secretary , dave prentis , said : " we know from our members who work in school kitchens that they are very worried about the poor quality of the food they are made to dish up .
" they know that given the choice children will make a beeline for the chips and burgers and we need to make sure that they are given healthy alternatives . "
but the shadow education secretary , tim collins , said : " this is beyond parody .
" labour wo n't let you choose your child 's school , but they want you to join a committee to discuss your child 's school dinners . "
a survey last year by the children 's charity barnardo 's found most pupils in england , wales and scotland accepted junk food as the " staple school diet " .
meanwhile , the soil association , which promotes organic farming , found " a typical " school meal - such as cheese fritters , roast potatoes , peas and flapjacks - every day provided 40 % more salt , 28 % more saturated fat and 20 % more sugar than recommended .
the results of the consultation with parents , schools , food activists and the food industry are expected to be published in april .
