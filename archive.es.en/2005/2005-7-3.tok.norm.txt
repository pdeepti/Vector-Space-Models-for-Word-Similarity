germany is now making funds available to speed up the mine clearance activities in the country . more than 400 people have died in bosnian minefields since the end of the war .
making the country mine-free is a difficult and time-consuming job that requires significant funds in addition to the technological know-how .
in an attempt to help bosnia in the demining process , germany has pledged 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- in aid for minesweeping in 35 locations across the country " our embassy participated in choosing the locations , and the tendering process is now taking place , " said detlev rüngner of the german foreign ministry . " the tender will hopefully result in most of these areas being demined by a qualified company in the course of this year , " rüngner said . german companies will also be able to bid for the job . " they will participate in the tender and be able to join other partners that are active in the region .
hopefully , their tender will be accepted , " rüngner said . a threat to the population and its economy thanks to the help of the german government , which is one of the most important donor countries in bosnia and herzegovina , large minefields will be cleared beginning this summer .
around 2,000 square kilometers of land in bosnia and herzegovina - two million square meters - is abandoned and unusable because of existing mines .
as much as they are a threat to human lives , landmines are responsible for significant economic losses in this country which is still struggling to recover from war . dorian marsic , director of the international trust fund for demining and mine victims assistance -lrb- itf -rrb- , said that around one quarter of mined territories could be cleared thanks with german funds . " currently , we could sweep around 527,000 square meters of land , " marsic said . reminders of the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around the city of tuzla is particularly affected by landmines the cantons of sarajevo and tuzla are particularly affected by mine fields , according to marsic , but so are border areas around brcko and mostar , as well as numerous mine fields in bihac , gorazde and other towns . " minefields exist everywhere where the fighting took place and where enemy forces had their posts , " said marsic . the german government is dedicated to helping bosnia and herzegovina overcome the consequences of the war .
according to rünger , the german engagement in the region will remain at a high level . " we will continue to finance projects there , the way we have been doing it since 1997 .
in this country alone , that has amounted to some eight million euros of support so far , " rünger said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sri lanka : creating awareness about landmines after two decades of civil war in sri lanka , armed forces and the separatist tamil tigers signed a ceasefire agreement in february 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2005 election campaign starts , but hurdles remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this room could be getting some new occupants the race towards early general elections in germany has begun in earnest , although many experts warn it is by no means certain that polls will take place in the autumn . german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary confidence vote on friday in a bid to trigger early elections and his social democratic party as well as the opposition started campaigning on saturday even though it is still unclear whether the president will dissolve parliament in the face of constitutional challenges . the embattled leader said he wanted elections 12 months ahead of schedule because he needed to know if he had the country 's support to continue with a series of economic reforms which have turned off many of his party 's traditional working-class , according to former vice-president of the constitutional court , ernst gottfried mahrenholz .
he also said that schröder 's given reasons for wanting to dissolve parliament were " not completely plausible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder speaking before the confidence vote " but by and large there are sufficient grounds for the question to be passed to the president , " mahrenholz told phoenix television . president horst köhler has until july 22 to decide whether to dissolve the parliament , something which polls show a majority of the population wants . one expert told the afp news agency it would be " deeply damaging " for germany , saddled with high unemployment and a stagnant economy , if it were not allowed to go to the polls this year . " most germans would see elections as an act of liberation .
if they do not take place , then it could be deeply damaging for the federal republic , " professor hans herbert von arnim of the german academy for political science in the western city of speyer said .
" constitutionally , the case for elections is watertight . " still , there are still hurdles to overcome if early elections are to be held .
the safeguards were built into germany 's basic law as a reaction to the chaos of the weimar republic in the 1920s which led to adolf hitler 's rise . election strategies planned regardless of the obstacles remaining , the main parties were pressing ahead with plans for their electoral campaigns . leaders of schröder 's social democratic party are to meet on monday to formulate their strategy while the opposition christian union bloc is set to announce its plans on july 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the conservatives , lead by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , have leaked some details of their campaign program , which seeks to spur growth with lower income taxes .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the top income tax rate will be cut from 42 percent to 39 percent .
an increase of the value-added tax , or vat , by two points to 18 percent is also planned . most polls currently give the union a 20-point lead .
a victory for the conservatives in september would see opposition leader angela merkel become germany 's first woman chancellor . why not resign ? in another bad sign for schröder , a poll released on friday showed half of germans believe he should have simply resigned if he wanted to force an election . resorting to the tactic of a no confidence vote was " dishonest , " according to 49 percent of respondents in the independent opinion research institute forsa poll . schröder himself argued friday that it was perfectly acceptable under the constitution to follow the no confidence vote route as opposed to standing down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer stresses a point as he delivers a speech during the german parliament debates a confidence vote in the german parliament in berlin but just when it looks as if schröder 's seven-year-old government is doomed , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded schröder 's rivals of what happened in 2002 when the chancellor overtook his conservative opponent at the last moment to win re-election . " you had the furniture packed , the pictures were ordered and you lost again .
so look out , " fischer said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " german chancellor gerhard schröder called on parliament to pave the way for early elections as he opened a debate in a no confidence motion he is hoping to lose .

he also said that schröder 's given reasons for wanting to dissolve parliament were " not completely plausible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder speaking before the confidence vote " but by and large there are sufficient grounds for the question to be passed to the president , " mahrenholz told phoenix television . president horst köhler has until july 22 to decide whether to dissolve the parliament , something which polls show a majority of the population wants . one expert told the afp news agency it would be " deeply damaging " for germany , saddled with high unemployment and a stagnant economy , if it were not allowed to go to the polls this year . " most germans would see elections as an act of liberation .
if they do not take place , then it could be deeply damaging for the federal republic , " professor hans herbert von arnim of the german academy for political science in the western city of speyer said .
" constitutionally , the case for elections is watertight . " still , there are still hurdles to overcome if early elections are to be held .
the safeguards were built into germany 's basic law as a reaction to the chaos of the weimar republic in the 1920s which led to adolf hitler 's rise . election strategies planned regardless of the obstacles remaining , the main parties were pressing ahead with plans for their electoral campaigns . leaders of schröder 's social democratic party are to meet on monday to formulate their strategy while the opposition christian union bloc is set to announce its plans on july 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the conservatives , lead by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , have leaked some details of their campaign program , which seeks to spur growth with lower income taxes .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the top income tax rate will be cut from 42 percent to 39 percent .
an increase of the value-added tax , or vat , by two points to 18 percent is also planned . most polls currently give the union a 20-point lead .
a victory for the conservatives in september would see opposition leader angela merkel become germany 's first woman chancellor . why not resign ? in another bad sign for schröder , a poll released on friday showed half of germans believe he should have simply resigned if he wanted to force an election . resorting to the tactic of a no confidence vote was " dishonest , " according to 49 percent of respondents in the independent opinion research institute forsa poll . schröder himself argued friday that it was perfectly acceptable under the constitution to follow the no confidence vote route as opposed to standing down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer stresses a point as he delivers a speech during the german parliament debates a confidence vote in the german parliament in berlin but just when it looks as if schröder 's seven-year-old government is doomed , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded schröder 's rivals of what happened in 2002 when the chancellor overtook his conservative opponent at the last moment to win re-election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2005 election campaign starts , but hurdles remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this room could be getting some new occupants the race towards early general elections in germany has begun in earnest , although many experts warn it is by no means certain that polls will take place in the autumn . german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary confidence vote on friday in a bid to trigger early elections and his social democratic party as well as the opposition started campaigning on saturday even though it is still unclear whether the president will dissolve parliament in the face of constitutional challenges . the embattled leader said he wanted elections 12 months ahead of schedule because he needed to know if he had the country 's support to continue with a series of economic reforms which have turned off many of his party 's traditional working-class , according to former vice-president of the constitutional court , ernst gottfried mahrenholz .
he also said that schröder 's given reasons for wanting to dissolve parliament were " not completely plausible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder speaking before the confidence vote " but by and large there are sufficient grounds for the question to be passed to the president , " mahrenholz told phoenix television . president horst köhler has until july 22 to decide whether to dissolve the parliament , something which polls show a majority of the population wants . one expert told the afp news agency it would be " deeply damaging " for germany , saddled with high unemployment and a stagnant economy , if it were not allowed to go to the polls this year . " most germans would see elections as an act of liberation .
if they do not take place , then it could be deeply damaging for the federal republic , " professor hans herbert von arnim of the german academy for political science in the western city of speyer said .
" constitutionally , the case for elections is watertight . " still , there are still hurdles to overcome if early elections are to be held .
the safeguards were built into germany 's basic law as a reaction to the chaos of the weimar republic in the 1920s which led to adolf hitler 's rise . election strategies planned regardless of the obstacles remaining , the main parties were pressing ahead with plans for their electoral campaigns . leaders of schröder 's social democratic party are to meet on monday to formulate their strategy while the opposition christian union bloc is set to announce its plans on july 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the conservatives , lead by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , have leaked some details of their campaign program , which seeks to spur growth with lower income taxes .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the top income tax rate will be cut from 42 percent to 39 percent .
an increase of the value-added tax , or vat , by two points to 18 percent is also planned . most polls currently give the union a 20-point lead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2005 election campaign starts , but hurdles remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this room could be getting some new occupants the race towards early general elections in germany has begun in earnest , although many experts warn it is by no means certain that polls will take place in the autumn . german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary confidence vote on friday in a bid to trigger early elections and his social democratic party as well as the opposition started campaigning on saturday even though it is still unclear whether the president will dissolve parliament in the face of constitutional challenges . the embattled leader said he wanted elections 12 months ahead of schedule because he needed to know if he had the country 's support to continue with a series of economic reforms which have turned off many of his party 's traditional working-class , according to former vice-president of the constitutional court , ernst gottfried mahrenholz .
he also said that schröder 's given reasons for wanting to dissolve parliament were " not completely plausible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder speaking before the confidence vote " but by and large there are sufficient grounds for the question to be passed to the president , " mahrenholz told phoenix television . president horst köhler has until july 22 to decide whether to dissolve the parliament , something which polls show a majority of the population wants . one expert told the afp news agency it would be " deeply damaging " for germany , saddled with high unemployment and a stagnant economy , if it were not allowed to go to the polls this year . " most germans would see elections as an act of liberation .
if they do not take place , then it could be deeply damaging for the federal republic , " professor hans herbert von arnim of the german academy for political science in the western city of speyer said .
" constitutionally , the case for elections is watertight . " still , there are still hurdles to overcome if early elections are to be held .
the safeguards were built into germany 's basic law as a reaction to the chaos of the weimar republic in the 1920s which led to adolf hitler 's rise . election strategies planned regardless of the obstacles remaining , the main parties were pressing ahead with plans for their electoral campaigns . leaders of schröder 's social democratic party are to meet on monday to formulate their strategy while the opposition christian union bloc is set to announce its plans on july 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the conservatives , lead by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , have leaked some details of their campaign program , which seeks to spur growth with lower income taxes .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the top income tax rate will be cut from 42 percent to 39 percent .
an increase of the value-added tax , or vat , by two points to 18 percent is also planned . most polls currently give the union a 20-point lead .
a victory for the conservatives in september would see opposition leader angela merkel become germany 's first woman chancellor . why not resign ? in another bad sign for schröder , a poll released on friday showed half of germans believe he should have simply resigned if he wanted to force an election . resorting to the tactic of a no confidence vote was " dishonest , " according to 49 percent of respondents in the independent opinion research institute forsa poll . schröder himself argued friday that it was perfectly acceptable under the constitution to follow the no confidence vote route as opposed to standing down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer stresses a point as he delivers a speech during the german parliament debates a confidence vote in the german parliament in berlin but just when it looks as if schröder 's seven-year-old government is doomed , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded schröder 's rivals of what happened in 2002 when the chancellor overtook his conservative opponent at the last moment to win re-election . " you had the furniture packed , the pictures were ordered and you lost again .
so look out , " fischer said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " german chancellor gerhard schröder called on parliament to pave the way for early elections as he opened a debate in a no confidence motion he is hoping to lose .

germany is now making funds available to speed up the mine clearance activities in the country . more than 400 people have died in bosnian minefields since the end of the war .
making the country mine-free is a difficult and time-consuming job that requires significant funds in addition to the technological know-how .
in an attempt to help bosnia in the demining process , germany has pledged 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- in aid for minesweeping in 35 locations across the country " our embassy participated in choosing the locations , and the tendering process is now taking place , " said detlev rüngner of the german foreign ministry . " the tender will hopefully result in most of these areas being demined by a qualified company in the course of this year , " rüngner said . german companies will also be able to bid for the job . " they will participate in the tender and be able to join other partners that are active in the region .
hopefully , their tender will be accepted , " rüngner said . a threat to the population and its economy thanks to the help of the german government , which is one of the most important donor countries in bosnia and herzegovina , large minefields will be cleared beginning this summer .
around 2,000 square kilometers of land in bosnia and herzegovina - two million square meters - is abandoned and unusable because of existing mines .
as much as they are a threat to human lives , landmines are responsible for significant economic losses in this country which is still struggling to recover from war . dorian marsic , director of the international trust fund for demining and mine victims assistance -lrb- itf -rrb- , said that around one quarter of mined territories could be cleared thanks with german funds . " currently , we could sweep around 527,000 square meters of land , " marsic said . reminders of the war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around the city of tuzla is particularly affected by landmines the cantons of sarajevo and tuzla are particularly affected by mine fields , according to marsic , but so are border areas around brcko and mostar , as well as numerous mine fields in bihac , gorazde and other towns . " minefields exist everywhere where the fighting took place and where enemy forces had their posts , " said marsic . the german government is dedicated to helping bosnia and herzegovina overcome the consequences of the war .
according to rünger , the german engagement in the region will remain at a high level . " we will continue to finance projects there , the way we have been doing it since 1997 .
in this country alone , that has amounted to some eight million euros of support so far , " rünger said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sri lanka : creating awareness about landmines after two decades of civil war in sri lanka , armed forces and the separatist tamil tigers signed a ceasefire agreement in february 2002 .

well , schumi 's is slightly smaller if you 've got it , flaunt it .
michael schumacher , seven-time formula one champion , is doing just that , showing off his vast wealth .
he 's building a private castle to the cool tune of 24 million euros -lrb- $ 28 million -rrb- . i mean , you gotta spoil yourself a bit , especially when you 're job is to ride around a track at high speeds crammed behind the steering wheel of a racing car .
so the 36-year-old schumacher is rewarding himself for his racing greatness with a little bungalow . well , size is in the eye of the beholder .
the bungalow in question has 2,200 square meters -lrb- 23,000 square feet -rrb- of living space , a 200-meter private beach , a boat launch and a 400 square-meter outbuilding for employees and guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari f1 driver michael schumacher " it is so much fun to build a house like this , " schumacher told germany 's bild newspaper .
" but it 's certainly stressful . " we 're sure of that .
just think of all the furniture he 's going to have to buy to fill it .
not to mention area rugs and light bulbs . the villa , or castle-lette , under construction is on switzerland 's lake geneva and has 24 rooms all in all .
of those , eight are bedrooms .
there are five bathrooms , a 20-meter swimming pool , a cinema with 30 seats , a gym , an underground garage with room for 25 cars and a 63 square-meter -lrb- 678 square-foot -rrb- room for all of mike 's trophies . to top it off , the palace has a 15-meter tower with an office and a climbing wall . not too bad for a family of four .

the race for the formula 1 crown starts on sunday with the australian grand prix , and michael schumacher is expecting a difficult start .

he also said that schröder 's given reasons for wanting to dissolve parliament were " not completely plausible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder speaking before the confidence vote " but by and large there are sufficient grounds for the question to be passed to the president , " mahrenholz told phoenix television . president horst köhler has until july 22 to decide whether to dissolve the parliament , something which polls show a majority of the population wants . one expert told the afp news agency it would be " deeply damaging " for germany , saddled with high unemployment and a stagnant economy , if it were not allowed to go to the polls this year . " most germans would see elections as an act of liberation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2005 election campaign starts , but hurdles remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this room could be getting some new occupants the race towards early general elections in germany has begun in earnest , although many experts warn it is by no means certain that polls will take place in the autumn . german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary confidence vote on friday in a bid to trigger early elections and his social democratic party as well as the opposition started campaigning on saturday even though it is still unclear whether the president will dissolve parliament in the face of constitutional challenges . the embattled leader said he wanted elections 12 months ahead of schedule because he needed to know if he had the country 's support to continue with a series of economic reforms which have turned off many of his party 's traditional working-class , according to former vice-president of the constitutional court , ernst gottfried mahrenholz .
he also said that schröder 's given reasons for wanting to dissolve parliament were " not completely plausible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder speaking before the confidence vote " but by and large there are sufficient grounds for the question to be passed to the president , " mahrenholz told phoenix television . president horst köhler has until july 22 to decide whether to dissolve the parliament , something which polls show a majority of the population wants . one expert told the afp news agency it would be " deeply damaging " for germany , saddled with high unemployment and a stagnant economy , if it were not allowed to go to the polls this year . " most germans would see elections as an act of liberation .
if they do not take place , then it could be deeply damaging for the federal republic , " professor hans herbert von arnim of the german academy for political science in the western city of speyer said .
" constitutionally , the case for elections is watertight . " still , there are still hurdles to overcome if early elections are to be held .
the safeguards were built into germany 's basic law as a reaction to the chaos of the weimar republic in the 1920s which led to adolf hitler 's rise . election strategies planned regardless of the obstacles remaining , the main parties were pressing ahead with plans for their electoral campaigns . leaders of schröder 's social democratic party are to meet on monday to formulate their strategy while the opposition christian union bloc is set to announce its plans on july 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the conservatives , lead by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , have leaked some details of their campaign program , which seeks to spur growth with lower income taxes .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the top income tax rate will be cut from 42 percent to 39 percent .
an increase of the value-added tax , or vat , by two points to 18 percent is also planned . most polls currently give the union a 20-point lead .
a victory for the conservatives in september would see opposition leader angela merkel become germany 's first woman chancellor . why not resign ? in another bad sign for schröder , a poll released on friday showed half of germans believe he should have simply resigned if he wanted to force an election . resorting to the tactic of a no confidence vote was " dishonest , " according to 49 percent of respondents in the independent opinion research institute forsa poll . schröder himself argued friday that it was perfectly acceptable under the constitution to follow the no confidence vote route as opposed to standing down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer stresses a point as he delivers a speech during the german parliament debates a confidence vote in the german parliament in berlin but just when it looks as if schröder 's seven-year-old government is doomed , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded schröder 's rivals of what happened in 2002 when the chancellor overtook his conservative opponent at the last moment to win re-election . " you had the furniture packed , the pictures were ordered and you lost again .
so look out , " fischer said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " german chancellor gerhard schröder called on parliament to pave the way for early elections as he opened a debate in a no confidence motion he is hoping to lose .

germany is now making funds available to speed up the mine clearance activities in the country . more than 400 people have died in bosnian minefields since the end of the war .
making the country mine-free is a difficult and time-consuming job that requires significant funds in addition to the technological know-how .
in an attempt to help bosnia in the demining process , germany has pledged 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- in aid for minesweeping in 35 locations across the country " our embassy participated in choosing the locations , and the tendering process is now taking place , " said detlev rüngner of the german foreign ministry .

" minefields exist everywhere where the fighting took place and where enemy forces had their posts , " said marsic . the german government is dedicated to helping bosnia and herzegovina overcome the consequences of the war .
according to rünger , the german engagement in the region will remain at a high level . " we will continue to finance projects there , the way we have been doing it since 1997 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.07.2005 election campaign starts , but hurdles remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this room could be getting some new occupants the race towards early general elections in germany has begun in earnest , although many experts warn it is by no means certain that polls will take place in the autumn . german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary confidence vote on friday in a bid to trigger early elections and his social democratic party as well as the opposition started campaigning on saturday even though it is still unclear whether the president will dissolve parliament in the face of constitutional challenges . the embattled leader said he wanted elections 12 months ahead of schedule because he needed to know if he had the country 's support to continue with a series of economic reforms which have turned off many of his party 's traditional working-class , according to former vice-president of the constitutional court , ernst gottfried mahrenholz .
he also said that schröder 's given reasons for wanting to dissolve parliament were " not completely plausible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder speaking before the confidence vote " but by and large there are sufficient grounds for the question to be passed to the president , " mahrenholz told phoenix television . president horst köhler has until july 22 to decide whether to dissolve the parliament , something which polls show a majority of the population wants . one expert told the afp news agency it would be " deeply damaging " for germany , saddled with high unemployment and a stagnant economy , if it were not allowed to go to the polls this year . " most germans would see elections as an act of liberation .
if they do not take place , then it could be deeply damaging for the federal republic , " professor hans herbert von arnim of the german academy for political science in the western city of speyer said .
" constitutionally , the case for elections is watertight . " still , there are still hurdles to overcome if early elections are to be held .
the safeguards were built into germany 's basic law as a reaction to the chaos of the weimar republic in the 1920s which led to adolf hitler 's rise . election strategies planned regardless of the obstacles remaining , the main parties were pressing ahead with plans for their electoral campaigns . leaders of schröder 's social democratic party are to meet on monday to formulate their strategy while the opposition christian union bloc is set to announce its plans on july 11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the conservatives , lead by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , have leaked some details of their campaign program , which seeks to spur growth with lower income taxes .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , the top income tax rate will be cut from 42 percent to 39 percent .
an increase of the value-added tax , or vat , by two points to 18 percent is also planned . most polls currently give the union a 20-point lead .
a victory for the conservatives in september would see opposition leader angela merkel become germany 's first woman chancellor . why not resign ? in another bad sign for schröder , a poll released on friday showed half of germans believe he should have simply resigned if he wanted to force an election . resorting to the tactic of a no confidence vote was " dishonest , " according to 49 percent of respondents in the independent opinion research institute forsa poll . schröder himself argued friday that it was perfectly acceptable under the constitution to follow the no confidence vote route as opposed to standing down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer stresses a point as he delivers a speech during the german parliament debates a confidence vote in the german parliament in berlin but just when it looks as if schröder 's seven-year-old government is doomed , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded schröder 's rivals of what happened in 2002 when the chancellor overtook his conservative opponent at the last moment to win re-election . " you had the furniture packed , the pictures were ordered and you lost again .

germany is now making funds available to speed up the mine clearance activities in the country . more than 400 people have died in bosnian minefields since the end of the war .
making the country mine-free is a difficult and time-consuming job that requires significant funds in addition to the technological know-how .
in an attempt to help bosnia in the demining process , germany has pledged 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- in aid for minesweeping in 35 locations across the country " our embassy participated in choosing the locations , and the tendering process is now taking place , " said detlev rüngner of the german foreign ministry . " the tender will hopefully result in most of these areas being demined by a qualified company in the course of this year , " rüngner said . german companies will also be able to bid for the job . " they will participate in the tender and be able to join other partners that are active in the region .
hopefully , their tender will be accepted , " rüngner said . a threat to the population and its economy thanks to the help of the german government , which is one of the most important donor countries in bosnia and herzegovina , large minefields will be cleared beginning this summer .

" minefields exist everywhere where the fighting took place and where enemy forces had their posts , " said marsic . the german government is dedicated to helping bosnia and herzegovina overcome the consequences of the war .
according to rünger , the german engagement in the region will remain at a high level . " we will continue to finance projects there , the way we have been doing it since 1997 .

america online -lrb- aol -rrb- is providing a free stream of all the concerts on the internet , although you need a broadband connection to see it properly .

the live 8 organisers are hoping these new and older technologies will help muster a worldwide audience of two billion people - 500 million more than those estimated to have tuned in to live aid .
but in some parts of the world - most notably africa itself - this profusion of new technologies means little , as few people have access to them .

cardiff university researchers say uk school lunches need to be more like italy for both pupils and countryside .
they found italy promoted local produce and did not confuse " best value " with " low cost , " unlike the uk .
the national farmers ' union cymru -lrb- nfu -rrb- is lobbying wales to follow italy and support local food and produce .

the self-confessed fan of african music said she was " very excited " to be at the africa calling event .
the concert , hosted by peter gabriel , was announced amid criticism that live 8 featured too few black artists .
artists from across africa performed .
senegalese star youssou n 'dour said it was live 8 's most important concert .
we can fix what 's happening in africa angelina jolie click here to see more pictures of africa calling at eden jolie , who was flown by helicopter to the eden project , was introduced to the crowd by peter gabriel as a great supporter of african causes .

" i 'm thrilled to meet all the african artists .
" all of the concerts are wonderful but i feel very connected to celebrating the people of africa , so this one is special to me .
" we can fix what 's happening in africa , we do have the answers and the ability to stop them dying . "
the actress said she was " amazed " by the biomes at the former clay pit at bodelva , near st austell .

daara j said : " we are honoured to play at live 8 's africa calling .

africa calling came after criticism that bob geldof had not included enough african artists in the main live 8 line-ups .
eden show compere and womad co-founder peter gabriel said he thought the music would have inspired people .
he said : " i did understand bob 's position that if any artists that people are unfamiliar with , if they were african , american , or wherever , would make people turn off . "
walking with dignity he added : " i did n't believe that was the case .
i thought that people would think that this music was so good that they would n't switch off .

" what i think peter gabriel and womad and all the people working really hard did was to have this for african people to show we 're ready to walk with everybody and have dignity . "
he and dido then went on to perform at the paris live 8 event .

opposition calls for a fairer distribution of wealth are a key issue .
q : why was the poll called ?
when prime minister paul berenger dissolved parliament in april and announced an election date , there was uproar among the opposition .
madan dulloo , leader of the mauritian socialist militant movement -lrb- mmsm -rrb- , said the announcement was unconstitutional , because mr berenger had failed to inform the president first .
president sir anerood jugnauth however dismissed the complaints and backed the prime minister .
mr berenger said that having just two months for the campaign would " avoid harming the national economy " .
q : what is at stake ?
the ruling coalition , the mauritius socialist movement-mauritian militant movement -lrb- mmm-msm -rrb- , led by paul berenger is confident it can win .
the mmm-msm says only it can continue the country 's economic progress , political stability and social harmony .
but opposition leader and ex-premier navin ramgoolam , who heads the social alliance , has accused the government of not doing enough to clamp down on corruption and drugs .
experts say mr ramgoolam 's hopes of becoming prime minister hinge on resentment among many non-whites at the perceived economic dominance of a franco-mauritian elite .
mauritian elections population - 1.2 million 62 out of 70 seats will be contested 634 candidates standing voting age - 18 years he has pledged " economic democratisation " by loosening what he calls the dominance of some families in key sectors of the economy .
the coalition draws most of its support from the majority ethnic indians and has been accused by the government of playing the " race card " .
mr berenger , a white mauritian of french descent , is the first non-hindu in the post .
there are no official opinion polls , but media reports suggest the two alliances are running neck and neck .
q : what does parliament do ?
mauritius is a republic with a unicameral national assembly , which elects a president by a simple majority for a five-year term .
executive power resides with the premier , who is appointed by the president from the party or coalition with the highest number of seats in parliament .
the president appoints ministers from elected members of parliament , on the recommendation of the prime minister .
the political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the official opposition .
q : what is the voting system ?
mauritius is divided into 20 three-member constituencies , which elect 60 deputies .
the island of rodrigues to the east , which forms part of the republic , returns a further two mps .
another eight , including the attorney-general , are appointed , making a total of 70 .
voters must be aged 18 years and have resided in the country for two years before polling day .
polling is overseen by the electoral commissioner 's office -lrb- eco -rrb- .
a total of 634 candidates are standing .
q : what happened last time ?
in 2000 the mauritius socialist movement-mauritian militant movement -lrb- mmm-msm -rrb- won a landslide 54 seats .
the mauritius labour party -lrb- mlp -rrb- / mauritian social democratic party -lrb- pmsd -rrb- got six and the organisation of rodrigan people -lrb- opr -rrb- two .
q : will there be observers ?
the government has invited foreign observers to monitor the polls , while the country 's media regulator has pledged equal media coverage for all political parties and coalitions .
monitors are expected from the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- and from india , as well as representatives of south africa 's electoral institute and botswana 's electoral commission .

opposition calls for a fairer distribution of wealth are a key issue .
q : why was the poll called ?
when prime minister paul berenger dissolved parliament in april and announced an election date , there was uproar among the opposition .
madan dulloo , leader of the mauritian socialist militant movement -lrb- mmsm -rrb- , said the announcement was unconstitutional , because mr berenger had failed to inform the president first .
president sir anerood jugnauth however dismissed the complaints and backed the prime minister .
mr berenger said that having just two months for the campaign would " avoid harming the national economy " .
q : what is at stake ?
the ruling coalition , the mauritius socialist movement-mauritian militant movement -lrb- mmm-msm -rrb- , led by paul berenger is confident it can win .
the mmm-msm says only it can continue the country 's economic progress , political stability and social harmony .
but opposition leader and ex-premier navin ramgoolam , who heads the social alliance , has accused the government of not doing enough to clamp down on corruption and drugs .
experts say mr ramgoolam 's hopes of becoming prime minister hinge on resentment among many non-whites at the perceived economic dominance of a franco-mauritian elite .
mauritian elections population - 1.2 million 62 out of 70 seats will be contested 634 candidates standing voting age - 18 years he has pledged " economic democratisation " by loosening what he calls the dominance of some families in key sectors of the economy .
the coalition draws most of its support from the majority ethnic indians and has been accused by the government of playing the " race card " .
mr berenger , a white mauritian of french descent , is the first non-hindu in the post .
there are no official opinion polls , but media reports suggest the two alliances are running neck and neck .
q : what does parliament do ?
mauritius is a republic with a unicameral national assembly , which elects a president by a simple majority for a five-year term .
executive power resides with the premier , who is appointed by the president from the party or coalition with the highest number of seats in parliament .
the president appoints ministers from elected members of parliament , on the recommendation of the prime minister .
the political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the official opposition .
q : what is the voting system ?
mauritius is divided into 20 three-member constituencies , which elect 60 deputies .
the island of rodrigues to the east , which forms part of the republic , returns a further two mps .
another eight , including the attorney-general , are appointed , making a total of 70 .
voters must be aged 18 years and have resided in the country for two years before polling day .
polling is overseen by the electoral commissioner 's office -lrb- eco -rrb- .
a total of 634 candidates are standing .
q : what happened last time ?
in 2000 the mauritius socialist movement-mauritian militant movement -lrb- mmm-msm -rrb- won a landslide 54 seats .
the mauritius labour party -lrb- mlp -rrb- / mauritian social democratic party -lrb- pmsd -rrb- got six and the organisation of rodrigan people -lrb- opr -rrb- two .
q : will there be observers ?
the government has invited foreign observers to monitor the polls , while the country 's media regulator has pledged equal media coverage for all political parties and coalitions .
monitors are expected from the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- and from india , as well as representatives of south africa 's electoral institute and botswana 's electoral commission .
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .
it is based in caversham , uk , and has several bureaus abroad .

are you ready to change history ?
i said , are you ready ? "
she was joined on stage by 24-year-old birhan woldu , one of the starving children featured in the original live aid concert who was helped thanks to money raised 20 years ago .
in philadelphia , destiny 's child , jay z and bon jovi were among the big name performers .

it 's debt ; trade and aid and governance .

" on behalf of the poor , the voiceless and the weak i say thank you . "

the weapons were not appropriate for " everyday circumstances " , she told police review .
only authorised firearms officers are currently allowed to use tasers , which deliver a 50,000-volt electric shock .
the police federation said about 80 % of its members were in favour of rolling out their use among frontline officers .
officers face dangers on a daily basis that require more than a pair of handcuffs and a truncheon alan gordon this was because officers often required more than just " handcuffs and a truncheon " , it said .
ms blears said : " taser is quite a dangerous weapon .
it is a less lethal option other than firearms , but it is not an everyday weapon used in everyday circumstances .
" my feeling at the moment is that it is substantially different from handcuffs and a truncheon , and i would not want to see everyone on the streets having that kind of weapon . "
she said the specialised firearms teams equipped with tasers were " trained in split second judgements " .
professionals but providing all officers with " an array of weapons " would not help believe close relationships between police and the public .
her stance was criticised by police federation vice chairman alan gordon , who said he " took exception " to the idea that tasers would not be safe in the hands of professionally trained officers .
he said : " officers face dangers on a daily basis that require more than a pair of handcuffs and a truncheon .
" to that extent we have long argued that tasers should be extended beyond firearms officers . "
however , a home office spokeswoman said the policy of not generally arming police officers gave " a character to our policing that we should not readily give up " .
she said : " safe as it is , there is no doubt taser is an aggressive response and the government believes it should only be used in strictly controlled conditions . "
