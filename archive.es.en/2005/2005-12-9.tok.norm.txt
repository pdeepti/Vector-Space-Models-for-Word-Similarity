now she owns the company and is among germany 's richest people . " nanny wanted for wealthy family , " read the job ad that brought friede springer , then only 23 and still named riewerts , to the axel springer verlag from her native north sea island of föhr in 1965 . fascinated by axel cäsar springer , who built a publishing empire from the ground up after world war two , friede became his girlfriend two years after taking the position to look after the publisher 's son nicolaus . a product of axel springer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while alive friede 's husband dominated much of her life she stayed at axel 's side for 13 years , becoming his fifth wife in 1978 .
a self-made billionaire , axel springer was also incredibly possessive and elitist . friede 's family was not invited to their wedding and he did not permit her to maintain contact with her old friends and forced her to phone her parents from the cellar . " i am a product of axel springer , " she said during an interview for springer 's welt am sonntag newspaper .
" it 's quite true : he created me , he made me what i am , and i say this quite openly . " strengthening the bond between them was friede 's staunch support of her husband , 30 years her senior , even when he was arguable germany 's most-hated man and the target of student protests in the late 1960s . until her husband 's death in 1985 , friede lived in a private world , secluded from the media and that dominates her life today as the head of germany 's largest publishing house , home to die welt and the bild tabloid , which has the highest circulation of any european newspaper . widow underestimated by media magnates bildunterschrift : the company was in a difficult stage when axel springer died , and the last thing friede needed after losing her husband was a series of battles over the inheritance .
but that 's what friede got . as the chief heir and executor of axel 's will , she was at the center of maneuvering from stockholders , members of the board and heirs .
they all of wanted to take over control of the publishing empire and set off a series of inheritance difficulties that would sporadically flare up over the next 20 years . underestimated by media moguls who did n't expect much of a fight from the 43-year-old widow who had dedicated herself to her husband , friede gradually bought back the company 's stock and became the majority shareholder . she and matthias döpfner , her choice for ceo , turned the company around and defended it from hostile takeover attacks by leo kirch , founder of the munich-based media company that tried to acquire a majority stake in springer ag , by attempting to stay true to axel 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the springer publishing house " i have not changed anything in his office , he is still present , " she said .
" when i have to make a decision i think of him and ask how he would decide .

" the current proposals from the british presidency -lrb- of the eu -rrb- are unsatisfactory from the french point of view , " french president jacques chirac said before a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday . " it is vital that every member state carries an equal share of the cost of enlargement , " he said , adding that this implies " a long term restructuring of britain 's rebate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac visited merkel near berlin on thursday , their first meeting since she took office the meeting between chirac and merkel at a castle outside berlin was described by chirac 's spokesman as an attempt to align the positions of the two nations traditionally considered the motor of the european union ahead of its crunch budget summit on dec .

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .
" it 's being played up because people are getting very excited . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .
for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- eu probes world cup ticket fees the european commission is investigating the ticket sales practices of world soccer body fifa .

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .
" this is a place that supports creativity , " heinig says .
" we have room here to encourage projects which go against lineal thinking .
we are not stuck in our ways . "

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .
" this is a place that supports creativity , " heinig says .
" we have room here to encourage projects which go against lineal thinking .
we are not stuck in our ways . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the city has been renovated since 1989 certainly the provincial city , which dates back to the middle ages and can boast centuries of rich cultural and musical tradition , can not be accused of dragging its heels when it comes to promoting its own evolution .
hansel says leipzig is neither shy of flaunting its assets nor bearing its faults .
" anyone who comes to the city can see very well what we are doing .
there are construction sites everywhere , but we don ’ t try to hide them or make them look nice , " he said .
" it 's a period of unfinished change and we have already achieved a great deal in a very short space of time . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what 's next for world cup teams ?

schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .

the arrest is seen as a boost for zagreb 's efforts to join the eu . chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , carla del ponte announced the news of gotovina 's capture during a visit to belgrade .
" i have very good news , since ante gotovina was arrested last night in spain , " she said . the news was welcomed worldwide , with nato foreign ministers gathered in brussels , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , breaking into spontaneous applause as they were told .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the arrest " very good news " , while british foreign secretary jack straw , whose nation holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , congratulated spanish and croatian authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect , gotovina gotovina , who was using a fake croatian passport in the name of kirstian horouat , was flown to the spanish capital , madrid , in a military aircraft , where he appeared before a judge at the city 's national court for a brief hearing .
he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .
he is accused of involvement in the deaths of about 150 serb civilians during a croatian offensive in 1995 , and is one of the war crimes tribunal 's three most-wanted fugitives .
radovan karadzic , the political leader of the serbs during bosnia 's 1992-1995 war , and his military chief , ratko mladic are still at large . croatian prime minister , ivo sanader , said the arrest endorsed the eu 's decision to start accession talks in october following a seven month delay on the grounds that brussels was dissatisfied with the level of zagreb 's cooperation in tracking down the ex-general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " it is the final confirmation of the credibility of croatia and its state institutions , " croatian prime minister ivo sanader said .
" those who believed us when we were saying that gotovina was not in croatia today received the final and complete confirmation . " conflict with catholic church in september , the prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia expressed frustration over croatia 's apparent inability to find and arrest the 50-year-old former general .
del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily . " i have taken this up with the vatican and the vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , " she told the daily telegraph .
croatia 's catholic church and the vatican strenuously rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icty prosecutor , carla del ponte speaking on bosnian serb television after the arrest on thursday , the chairman of bosnia 's tripartite presidency , ivo miro jovic said the arrest was an embarrassment for the chief war crimes prosecutor . " will del ponte be ashamed at all after her statements , which inflicted great damage on the roman catholic church , that gotovina was hiding in monasteries here and in croatia , " he said . but observers say the arrest strengthens del ponte 's position , which was viewed as weakened after she approved croatia 's future eu membership before gotovina had been arrested .
it was seen as an indication of hope for belgrade 's eu bid even with karadzic and mladic on the loose . six fugitives on the loose del ponte said she now expected karadzic and mladic and the other fugitives to be arrested ..

" conflict with catholic church in september , the prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia expressed frustration over croatia 's apparent inability to find and arrest the 50-year-old former general .
del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily . " i have taken this up with the vatican and the vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , " she told the daily telegraph .
croatia 's catholic church and the vatican strenuously rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icty prosecutor , carla del ponte speaking on bosnian serb television after the arrest on thursday , the chairman of bosnia 's tripartite presidency , ivo miro jovic said the arrest was an embarrassment for the chief war crimes prosecutor . " will del ponte be ashamed at all after her statements , which inflicted great damage on the roman catholic church , that gotovina was hiding in monasteries here and in croatia , " he said . but observers say the arrest strengthens del ponte 's position , which was viewed as weakened after she approved croatia 's future eu membership before gotovina had been arrested .
it was seen as an indication of hope for belgrade 's eu bid even with karadzic and mladic on the loose . six fugitives on the loose del ponte said she now expected karadzic and mladic and the other fugitives to be arrested ..
of the 161 people indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , six remain at large .
but rasim ljajic , serbia-montenegro 's minister for human and minority rights , insists that belgrade is in the dark as to the two main suspects ' whereabouts . " i do not expect ratko mladic or any other indictees still at large to go to the hague by december 15 , " he said in reference to del ponte 's december 14 deadline - the 10th anniversary of the signing of the dayton peace accords that ended bosnia 's war - for the pair 's arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted posters for radko mladic and radovan karadzic the war crimes court has charged karadzic and mladic with genocide and crimes against humanity , notably in relation to the 43-month siege of sarajevo and massacre of more than 8,000 muslim males in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica in july 1995 . if del ponte decrees belgrade is being obstructive , talks on eventual eu membership could be blocked . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bosnian serbs compile srebrenica list the bosnian serb government has drawn up a list of 19,473 former soldiers who operated in the region of srebrenica at the time of the massacre there in 1995 , officials said .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable .

a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough .

" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel .

as a result , annan cancelled a scheduled visit to iran , and the country was chastized by the un security council and drew fierce condemnation from the west - already alarmed over its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program . denying the holocaust in ahmadinejad 's interview thursday , he referred to the holocaust as a matter of belief , and raised the issue of revisionist historians - who attempt to establish that figures on the number of jews killed by the nazis are wildly exaggerated - being prosecuted in europe . " is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .
" then because the jews have been oppressed during the second world war , therefore they -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have to support the occupying regime of qods -lrb- jerusalem -rrb- .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel . " and israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev said : " i hope that these outrageous remarks will be a wake-up call to people who have any illusions about the nature of the regime in iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
israel 's views were echoed by the united states , its closest ally . " it just further underscores our concerns about the regime in iran .
and its all the more reason why its so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons , " said white house spokesman scott mcclellan . europeans express outrage merkel was far from the only european leader to pounce on the iranian leader . austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel , speaking after a meeting with us president george w. bush , called the remarks " an outrageous gaffe , which i want to repudiate in the sharpest manner . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : comments ' do n't make diplomacy easier . '
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu 's nuclear diplomacy is " not made easier " by ahmadinejad 's statements .
and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also condemned the remarks . annan expresses ' shock ' un secretary general kofi annan was " shocked to see the remarks " according to a un statement .
only last month , the un general assembly passed a resolution which " rejects any denial of the holocaust as an historical event , either in full or in part . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan and the un passed a resolution rejecting holocaust denial ahmadinejad , a straight-talking former commando who swept to the presidency after a shock election win in june , is no stranger to controversy . in october , ahmadinejad called for israel to be " wiped off the map . "
as a result , annan cancelled a scheduled visit to iran , and the country was chastized by the un security council and drew fierce condemnation from the west - already alarmed over its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program . denying the holocaust in ahmadinejad 's interview thursday , he referred to the holocaust as a matter of belief , and raised the issue of revisionist historians - who attempt to establish that figures on the number of jews killed by the nazis are wildly exaggerated - being prosecuted in europe . " is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .
" then because the jews have been oppressed during the second world war , therefore they -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have to support the occupying regime of qods -lrb- jerusalem -rrb- .
we do not accept this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a holocaust memorial was recently established in berlin the holocaust was nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . official iranian media frequently carry sympathetic interviews with holocaust revisionists , and the regime itself also refuses to recognise israel . ahmadinejad also proposed " a referendum in palestine for all the original palestinians " to decide on the future of what is now israel , the gaza strip and west bank . call for resistance but he said " the best solution is resistance so that the enemies of the palestinians accept the reality and the right of the palestinian people to have land . " ahmadinejad 's tone has also been a major departure from his pro-reform predecessor mohammad khatami , who had eased anti-western rhetoric and sought to bring iran out of international isolation by calling for a " dialogue among civilisations .

" nanny wanted for wealthy family , " read the job ad that brought friede springer , then only 23 and still named riewerts , to the axel springer verlag from her native north sea island of föhr in 1965 . fascinated by axel cäsar springer , who built a publishing empire from the ground up after world war two , friede became his girlfriend two years after taking the position to look after the publisher 's son nicolaus . a product of axel springer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while alive friede 's husband dominated much of her life she stayed at axel 's side for 13 years , becoming his fifth wife in 1978 .
a self-made billionaire , axel springer was also incredibly possessive and elitist . friede 's family was not invited to their wedding and he did not permit her to maintain contact with her old friends and forced her to phone her parents from the cellar .

they all of wanted to take over control of the publishing empire and set off a series of inheritance difficulties that would sporadically flare up over the next 20 years . underestimated by media moguls who did n't expect much of a fight from the 43-year-old widow who had dedicated herself to her husband , friede gradually bought back the company 's stock and became the majority shareholder . she and matthias döpfner , her choice for ceo , turned the company around and defended it from hostile takeover attacks by leo kirch , founder of the munich-based media company that tried to acquire a majority stake in springer ag , by attempting to stay true to axel 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the springer publishing house " i have not changed anything in his office , he is still present , " she said .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel . " and israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev said : " i hope that these outrageous remarks will be a wake-up call to people who have any illusions about the nature of the regime in iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
israel 's views were echoed by the united states , its closest ally . " it just further underscores our concerns about the regime in iran .

the arrest is seen as a boost for zagreb 's efforts to join the eu . chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , carla del ponte announced the news of gotovina 's capture during a visit to belgrade .
" i have very good news , since ante gotovina was arrested last night in spain , " she said . the news was welcomed worldwide , with nato foreign ministers gathered in brussels , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , breaking into spontaneous applause as they were told .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the arrest " very good news " , while british foreign secretary jack straw , whose nation holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , congratulated spanish and croatian authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect , gotovina gotovina , who was using a fake croatian passport in the name of kirstian horouat , was flown to the spanish capital , madrid , in a military aircraft , where he appeared before a judge at the city 's national court for a brief hearing .
he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .
he is accused of involvement in the deaths of about 150 serb civilians during a croatian offensive in 1995 , and is one of the war crimes tribunal 's three most-wanted fugitives .
radovan karadzic , the political leader of the serbs during bosnia 's 1992-1995 war , and his military chief , ratko mladic are still at large . croatian prime minister , ivo sanader , said the arrest endorsed the eu 's decision to start accession talks in october following a seven month delay on the grounds that brussels was dissatisfied with the level of zagreb 's cooperation in tracking down the ex-general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " it is the final confirmation of the credibility of croatia and its state institutions , " croatian prime minister ivo sanader said .
" those who believed us when we were saying that gotovina was not in croatia today received the final and complete confirmation . " conflict with catholic church in september , the prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia expressed frustration over croatia 's apparent inability to find and arrest the 50-year-old former general .
del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily . " i have taken this up with the vatican and the vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , " she told the daily telegraph .
croatia 's catholic church and the vatican strenuously rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icty prosecutor , carla del ponte speaking on bosnian serb television after the arrest on thursday , the chairman of bosnia 's tripartite presidency , ivo miro jovic said the arrest was an embarrassment for the chief war crimes prosecutor . " will del ponte be ashamed at all after her statements , which inflicted great damage on the roman catholic church , that gotovina was hiding in monasteries here and in croatia , " he said . but observers say the arrest strengthens del ponte 's position , which was viewed as weakened after she approved croatia 's future eu membership before gotovina had been arrested .
it was seen as an indication of hope for belgrade 's eu bid even with karadzic and mladic on the loose . six fugitives on the loose del ponte said she now expected karadzic and mladic and the other fugitives to be arrested ..
of the 161 people indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , six remain at large .
but rasim ljajic , serbia-montenegro 's minister for human and minority rights , insists that belgrade is in the dark as to the two main suspects ' whereabouts . " i do not expect ratko mladic or any other indictees still at large to go to the hague by december 15 , " he said in reference to del ponte 's december 14 deadline - the 10th anniversary of the signing of the dayton peace accords that ended bosnia 's war - for the pair 's arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted posters for radko mladic and radovan karadzic the war crimes court has charged karadzic and mladic with genocide and crimes against humanity , notably in relation to the 43-month siege of sarajevo and massacre of more than 8,000 muslim males in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica in july 1995 . if del ponte decrees belgrade is being obstructive , talks on eventual eu membership could be blocked . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bosnian serbs compile srebrenica list the bosnian serb government has drawn up a list of 19,473 former soldiers who operated in the region of srebrenica at the time of the massacre there in 1995 , officials said .

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .
" it 's being played up because people are getting very excited . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

french president jacques chirac termed the current proposals for the eu budget " unsatisfactory " and urged a restructuring of britain 's rebate . " the current proposals from the british presidency -lrb- of the eu -rrb- are unsatisfactory from the french point of view , " french president jacques chirac said before a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday . " it is vital that every member state carries an equal share of the cost of enlargement , " he said , adding that this implies " a long term restructuring of britain 's rebate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac visited merkel near berlin on thursday , their first meeting since she took office the meeting between chirac and merkel at a castle outside berlin was described by chirac 's spokesman as an attempt to align the positions of the two nations traditionally considered the motor of the european union ahead of its crunch budget summit on dec .
15 and 16 . merkel was more cautious in her remarks , saying she did not want to single out specific elements of the budget proposals for criticism , and urging member states " to use every opportunity " to reach an accord . merkel : plan has ' rough patches ' " when one is preparing for negotiations it is often better not to single out specific details and not to assume a definitive stance , " she told a joint press conference of the two leaders . earlier this week she also called on the british government to revise their proposals . " we could , from the german side , imagine improvements on some points .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .

" is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .

french president jacques chirac termed the current proposals for the eu budget " unsatisfactory " and urged a restructuring of britain 's rebate . " the current proposals from the british presidency -lrb- of the eu -rrb- are unsatisfactory from the french point of view , " french president jacques chirac said before a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday . " it is vital that every member state carries an equal share of the cost of enlargement , " he said , adding that this implies " a long term restructuring of britain 's rebate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac visited merkel near berlin on thursday , their first meeting since she took office the meeting between chirac and merkel at a castle outside berlin was described by chirac 's spokesman as an attempt to align the positions of the two nations traditionally considered the motor of the european union ahead of its crunch budget summit on dec .
15 and 16 . merkel was more cautious in her remarks , saying she did not want to single out specific elements of the budget proposals for criticism , and urging member states " to use every opportunity " to reach an accord . merkel : plan has ' rough patches ' " when one is preparing for negotiations it is often better not to single out specific details and not to assume a definitive stance , " she told a joint press conference of the two leaders . earlier this week she also called on the british government to revise their proposals .

the arrest is seen as a boost for zagreb 's efforts to join the eu . chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , carla del ponte announced the news of gotovina 's capture during a visit to belgrade .
" i have very good news , since ante gotovina was arrested last night in spain , " she said . the news was welcomed worldwide , with nato foreign ministers gathered in brussels , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , breaking into spontaneous applause as they were told .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the arrest " very good news " , while british foreign secretary jack straw , whose nation holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , congratulated spanish and croatian authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect , gotovina gotovina , who was using a fake croatian passport in the name of kirstian horouat , was flown to the spanish capital , madrid , in a military aircraft , where he appeared before a judge at the city 's national court for a brief hearing .
he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .
he is accused of involvement in the deaths of about 150 serb civilians during a croatian offensive in 1995 , and is one of the war crimes tribunal 's three most-wanted fugitives .
radovan karadzic , the political leader of the serbs during bosnia 's 1992-1995 war , and his military chief , ratko mladic are still at large . croatian prime minister , ivo sanader , said the arrest endorsed the eu 's decision to start accession talks in october following a seven month delay on the grounds that brussels was dissatisfied with the level of zagreb 's cooperation in tracking down the ex-general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " it is the final confirmation of the credibility of croatia and its state institutions , " croatian prime minister ivo sanader said .
" those who believed us when we were saying that gotovina was not in croatia today received the final and complete confirmation . " conflict with catholic church in september , the prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia expressed frustration over croatia 's apparent inability to find and arrest the 50-year-old former general .
del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily . " i have taken this up with the vatican and the vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , " she told the daily telegraph .
croatia 's catholic church and the vatican strenuously rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icty prosecutor , carla del ponte speaking on bosnian serb television after the arrest on thursday , the chairman of bosnia 's tripartite presidency , ivo miro jovic said the arrest was an embarrassment for the chief war crimes prosecutor . " will del ponte be ashamed at all after her statements , which inflicted great damage on the roman catholic church , that gotovina was hiding in monasteries here and in croatia , " he said . but observers say the arrest strengthens del ponte 's position , which was viewed as weakened after she approved croatia 's future eu membership before gotovina had been arrested .
it was seen as an indication of hope for belgrade 's eu bid even with karadzic and mladic on the loose . six fugitives on the loose del ponte said she now expected karadzic and mladic and the other fugitives to be arrested ..
of the 161 people indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , six remain at large .
but rasim ljajic , serbia-montenegro 's minister for human and minority rights , insists that belgrade is in the dark as to the two main suspects ' whereabouts . " i do not expect ratko mladic or any other indictees still at large to go to the hague by december 15 , " he said in reference to del ponte 's december 14 deadline - the 10th anniversary of the signing of the dayton peace accords that ended bosnia 's war - for the pair 's arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted posters for radko mladic and radovan karadzic the war crimes court has charged karadzic and mladic with genocide and crimes against humanity , notably in relation to the 43-month siege of sarajevo and massacre of more than 8,000 muslim males in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica in july 1995 . if del ponte decrees belgrade is being obstructive , talks on eventual eu membership could be blocked . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bosnian serbs compile srebrenica list the bosnian serb government has drawn up a list of 19,473 former soldiers who operated in the region of srebrenica at the time of the massacre there in 1995 , officials said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 09.12.2005 pre-world cup problems to be solved großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems such as hooliganism will be hindered at stadiums the world cup promises excitement beyond comparison but due to the scope of the event , problems are inevitable .
the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .
" it 's being played up because people are getting very excited . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .
for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- eu probes world cup ticket fees the european commission is investigating the ticket sales practices of world soccer body fifa .
the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery .

french president jacques chirac termed the current proposals for the eu budget " unsatisfactory " and urged a restructuring of britain 's rebate . " the current proposals from the british presidency -lrb- of the eu -rrb- are unsatisfactory from the french point of view , " french president jacques chirac said before a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday . " it is vital that every member state carries an equal share of the cost of enlargement , " he said , adding that this implies " a long term restructuring of britain 's rebate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac visited merkel near berlin on thursday , their first meeting since she took office the meeting between chirac and merkel at a castle outside berlin was described by chirac 's spokesman as an attempt to align the positions of the two nations traditionally considered the motor of the european union ahead of its crunch budget summit on dec .
15 and 16 . merkel was more cautious in her remarks , saying she did not want to single out specific elements of the budget proposals for criticism , and urging member states " to use every opportunity " to reach an accord . merkel : plan has ' rough patches ' " when one is preparing for negotiations it is often better not to single out specific details and not to assume a definitive stance , " she told a joint press conference of the two leaders . earlier this week she also called on the british government to revise their proposals . " we could , from the german side , imagine improvements on some points .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel . " and israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev said : " i hope that these outrageous remarks will be a wake-up call to people who have any illusions about the nature of the regime in iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
israel 's views were echoed by the united states , its closest ally . " it just further underscores our concerns about the regime in iran .
and its all the more reason why its so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons , " said white house spokesman scott mcclellan . europeans express outrage merkel was far from the only european leader to pounce on the iranian leader . austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel , speaking after a meeting with us president george w. bush , called the remarks " an outrageous gaffe , which i want to repudiate in the sharpest manner . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : comments ' do n't make diplomacy easier . '
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu 's nuclear diplomacy is " not made easier " by ahmadinejad 's statements .
and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also condemned the remarks . annan expresses ' shock ' un secretary general kofi annan was " shocked to see the remarks " according to a un statement .
only last month , the un general assembly passed a resolution which " rejects any denial of the holocaust as an historical event , either in full or in part . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan and the un passed a resolution rejecting holocaust denial ahmadinejad , a straight-talking former commando who swept to the presidency after a shock election win in june , is no stranger to controversy . in october , ahmadinejad called for israel to be " wiped off the map . "
as a result , annan cancelled a scheduled visit to iran , and the country was chastized by the un security council and drew fierce condemnation from the west - already alarmed over its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program . denying the holocaust in ahmadinejad 's interview thursday , he referred to the holocaust as a matter of belief , and raised the issue of revisionist historians - who attempt to establish that figures on the number of jews killed by the nazis are wildly exaggerated - being prosecuted in europe . " is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .
" then because the jews have been oppressed during the second world war , therefore they -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have to support the occupying regime of qods -lrb- jerusalem -rrb- .
we do not accept this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a holocaust memorial was recently established in berlin the holocaust was nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . official iranian media frequently carry sympathetic interviews with holocaust revisionists , and the regime itself also refuses to recognise israel . ahmadinejad also proposed " a referendum in palestine for all the original palestinians " to decide on the future of what is now israel , the gaza strip and west bank . call for resistance but he said " the best solution is resistance so that the enemies of the palestinians accept the reality and the right of the palestinian people to have land . " ahmadinejad 's tone has also been a major departure from his pro-reform predecessor mohammad khatami , who had eased anti-western rhetoric and sought to bring iran out of international isolation by calling for a " dialogue among civilisations .

now she owns the company and is among germany 's richest people . " nanny wanted for wealthy family , " read the job ad that brought friede springer , then only 23 and still named riewerts , to the axel springer verlag from her native north sea island of föhr in 1965 . fascinated by axel cäsar springer , who built a publishing empire from the ground up after world war two , friede became his girlfriend two years after taking the position to look after the publisher 's son nicolaus . a product of axel springer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while alive friede 's husband dominated much of her life she stayed at axel 's side for 13 years , becoming his fifth wife in 1978 .
a self-made billionaire , axel springer was also incredibly possessive and elitist . friede 's family was not invited to their wedding and he did not permit her to maintain contact with her old friends and forced her to phone her parents from the cellar . " i am a product of axel springer , " she said during an interview for springer 's welt am sonntag newspaper .
" it 's quite true : he created me , he made me what i am , and i say this quite openly . " strengthening the bond between them was friede 's staunch support of her husband , 30 years her senior , even when he was arguable germany 's most-hated man and the target of student protests in the late 1960s . until her husband 's death in 1985 , friede lived in a private world , secluded from the media and that dominates her life today as the head of germany 's largest publishing house , home to die welt and the bild tabloid , which has the highest circulation of any european newspaper . widow underestimated by media magnates bildunterschrift : the company was in a difficult stage when axel springer died , and the last thing friede needed after losing her husband was a series of battles over the inheritance .
but that 's what friede got . as the chief heir and executor of axel 's will , she was at the center of maneuvering from stockholders , members of the board and heirs .
they all of wanted to take over control of the publishing empire and set off a series of inheritance difficulties that would sporadically flare up over the next 20 years . underestimated by media moguls who did n't expect much of a fight from the 43-year-old widow who had dedicated herself to her husband , friede gradually bought back the company 's stock and became the majority shareholder . she and matthias döpfner , her choice for ceo , turned the company around and defended it from hostile takeover attacks by leo kirch , founder of the munich-based media company that tried to acquire a majority stake in springer ag , by attempting to stay true to axel 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the springer publishing house " i have not changed anything in his office , he is still present , " she said .
" when i have to make a decision i think of him and ask how he would decide .

" a day later , she raised the contentious prisons issue first at an informal dinner at the headquarters of nato in brussels , attended by 32 foreign ministers from the military alliance and the european union . several european ministers declared afterwards that they were " satisfied " with her explanations on the cia 's use of airports in a process known as " rendition " - forcibly sending prisoners to places where they can be charged . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said rice 's remarks had " cleared the air . " but the top us diplomat failed to clarify whether the cia had secret prisons in europe where suspected terrorists were being held , and often chose instead to hide behind security secrecy laws . nevertheless she had the support of europe 's diplomats . " i appreciate the supportive comments that a number of colleagues have made , " she said in brussels .
" i appreciate the fact that people recognize the dilemmas we face . " rice concedes that public needs more convincing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrating against cia tactics in europe have shadowed rice on her tour .
but asked if she thought that european public opinion remained to be convinced about us policy , she conceded that more efforts might be needed .
" i think that it 's only natural that sometimes we have these discussions .
questions , concerns arise , we should discuss them in a serious way among friends . " " whether or not it will continue to be a matter of discussion i ca n't say .
i 'm perfectly happy to continue to have this discussion , " she told reporters . us officials said on thursday that they would indeed continue . rice in the direct line of fire over cia allegations rice has found herself on the front line over the secret prisons at a delicate time in transatlantic relations , after both sides have made considerable efforts to move on from the tensions raised by the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw will follow up on behalf of the eu .
in the name of the european union , british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency and is washingon 's main ally in iraq , said he would seek clarification from rice over the prisons . but with her credibility on the line over her country 's treatment of terror suspects lost in the system without trial or means of appeal , rice took shelter behind us president george w. bush .
" the united states is quite clear and quite determined to carry out the president 's policy .
the us does not engage in torture , does n't condone it , does n't expect its employees to engage in it . " further abuse scandals " entirely possible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice did not rule out more scandals but said those involved would be punished .
but she said that abuses like those committed by us personnel at the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq could not be ruled out , although she noted that those who are responsible will be punished . " will there be abuses of policy ?
that is entirely possible .
because just because you 're a democracy it does n't mean you 're perfect , " she said . " that is the only promise that we can make to people : if we find abuses we will investigate them fully and punish them . " rice 's message had clearly evolved from the one she delivered on leaving washington on monday .
" it is up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks against their own country or other countries , and decide how much sensitive information they can make public , " she said then . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice ' clears air ' over cia row in brussels european ministers relieved some of the transatlantic tension of the cia affair with rice over dinner wednesday night .

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .
" it 's being played up because people are getting very excited . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .
" it 's being played up because people are getting very excited . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .
for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- eu probes world cup ticket fees the european commission is investigating the ticket sales practices of world soccer body fifa .
the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel . " and israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev said : " i hope that these outrageous remarks will be a wake-up call to people who have any illusions about the nature of the regime in iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
israel 's views were echoed by the united states , its closest ally . " it just further underscores our concerns about the regime in iran .
and its all the more reason why its so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons , " said white house spokesman scott mcclellan . europeans express outrage merkel was far from the only european leader to pounce on the iranian leader . austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel , speaking after a meeting with us president george w. bush , called the remarks " an outrageous gaffe , which i want to repudiate in the sharpest manner . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : comments ' do n't make diplomacy easier . '
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu 's nuclear diplomacy is " not made easier " by ahmadinejad 's statements .
and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also condemned the remarks . annan expresses ' shock ' un secretary general kofi annan was " shocked to see the remarks " according to a un statement .
only last month , the un general assembly passed a resolution which " rejects any denial of the holocaust as an historical event , either in full or in part . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan and the un passed a resolution rejecting holocaust denial ahmadinejad , a straight-talking former commando who swept to the presidency after a shock election win in june , is no stranger to controversy . in october , ahmadinejad called for israel to be " wiped off the map . "
as a result , annan cancelled a scheduled visit to iran , and the country was chastized by the un security council and drew fierce condemnation from the west - already alarmed over its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program . denying the holocaust in ahmadinejad 's interview thursday , he referred to the holocaust as a matter of belief , and raised the issue of revisionist historians - who attempt to establish that figures on the number of jews killed by the nazis are wildly exaggerated - being prosecuted in europe . " is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .
" then because the jews have been oppressed during the second world war , therefore they -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have to support the occupying regime of qods -lrb- jerusalem -rrb- .
we do not accept this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a holocaust memorial was recently established in berlin the holocaust was nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . official iranian media frequently carry sympathetic interviews with holocaust revisionists , and the regime itself also refuses to recognise israel . ahmadinejad also proposed " a referendum in palestine for all the original palestinians " to decide on the future of what is now israel , the gaza strip and west bank . call for resistance but he said " the best solution is resistance so that the enemies of the palestinians accept the reality and the right of the palestinian people to have land .

the arrest is seen as a boost for zagreb 's efforts to join the eu . chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , carla del ponte announced the news of gotovina 's capture during a visit to belgrade .
" i have very good news , since ante gotovina was arrested last night in spain , " she said . the news was welcomed worldwide , with nato foreign ministers gathered in brussels , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , breaking into spontaneous applause as they were told .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the arrest " very good news " , while british foreign secretary jack straw , whose nation holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , congratulated spanish and croatian authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect , gotovina gotovina , who was using a fake croatian passport in the name of kirstian horouat , was flown to the spanish capital , madrid , in a military aircraft , where he appeared before a judge at the city 's national court for a brief hearing .
he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .
he is accused of involvement in the deaths of about 150 serb civilians during a croatian offensive in 1995 , and is one of the war crimes tribunal 's three most-wanted fugitives .
radovan karadzic , the political leader of the serbs during bosnia 's 1992-1995 war , and his military chief , ratko mladic are still at large . croatian prime minister , ivo sanader , said the arrest endorsed the eu 's decision to start accession talks in october following a seven month delay on the grounds that brussels was dissatisfied with the level of zagreb 's cooperation in tracking down the ex-general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " it is the final confirmation of the credibility of croatia and its state institutions , " croatian prime minister ivo sanader said .
" those who believed us when we were saying that gotovina was not in croatia today received the final and complete confirmation . " conflict with catholic church in september , the prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia expressed frustration over croatia 's apparent inability to find and arrest the 50-year-old former general .
del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily . " i have taken this up with the vatican and the vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , " she told the daily telegraph .
croatia 's catholic church and the vatican strenuously rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icty prosecutor , carla del ponte speaking on bosnian serb television after the arrest on thursday , the chairman of bosnia 's tripartite presidency , ivo miro jovic said the arrest was an embarrassment for the chief war crimes prosecutor . " will del ponte be ashamed at all after her statements , which inflicted great damage on the roman catholic church , that gotovina was hiding in monasteries here and in croatia , " he said . but observers say the arrest strengthens del ponte 's position , which was viewed as weakened after she approved croatia 's future eu membership before gotovina had been arrested .
it was seen as an indication of hope for belgrade 's eu bid even with karadzic and mladic on the loose . six fugitives on the loose del ponte said she now expected karadzic and mladic and the other fugitives to be arrested ..
of the 161 people indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , six remain at large .
but rasim ljajic , serbia-montenegro 's minister for human and minority rights , insists that belgrade is in the dark as to the two main suspects ' whereabouts . " i do not expect ratko mladic or any other indictees still at large to go to the hague by december 15 , " he said in reference to del ponte 's december 14 deadline - the 10th anniversary of the signing of the dayton peace accords that ended bosnia 's war - for the pair 's arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted posters for radko mladic and radovan karadzic the war crimes court has charged karadzic and mladic with genocide and crimes against humanity , notably in relation to the 43-month siege of sarajevo and massacre of more than 8,000 muslim males in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica in july 1995 . if del ponte decrees belgrade is being obstructive , talks on eventual eu membership could be blocked . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bosnian serbs compile srebrenica list the bosnian serb government has drawn up a list of 19,473 former soldiers who operated in the region of srebrenica at the time of the massacre there in 1995 , officials said .

he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .
" it 's being played up because people are getting very excited . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .
for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- eu probes world cup ticket fees the european commission is investigating the ticket sales practices of world soccer body fifa .
the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery .

the arrest is seen as a boost for zagreb 's efforts to join the eu . chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , carla del ponte announced the news of gotovina 's capture during a visit to belgrade .
" i have very good news , since ante gotovina was arrested last night in spain , " she said . the news was welcomed worldwide , with nato foreign ministers gathered in brussels , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , breaking into spontaneous applause as they were told .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the arrest " very good news " , while british foreign secretary jack straw , whose nation holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , congratulated spanish and croatian authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect , gotovina gotovina , who was using a fake croatian passport in the name of kirstian horouat , was flown to the spanish capital , madrid , in a military aircraft , where he appeared before a judge at the city 's national court for a brief hearing .
he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .
he is accused of involvement in the deaths of about 150 serb civilians during a croatian offensive in 1995 , and is one of the war crimes tribunal 's three most-wanted fugitives .
radovan karadzic , the political leader of the serbs during bosnia 's 1992-1995 war , and his military chief , ratko mladic are still at large . croatian prime minister , ivo sanader , said the arrest endorsed the eu 's decision to start accession talks in october following a seven month delay on the grounds that brussels was dissatisfied with the level of zagreb 's cooperation in tracking down the ex-general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " it is the final confirmation of the credibility of croatia and its state institutions , " croatian prime minister ivo sanader said .
" those who believed us when we were saying that gotovina was not in croatia today received the final and complete confirmation . " conflict with catholic church in september , the prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia expressed frustration over croatia 's apparent inability to find and arrest the 50-year-old former general .
del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily . " i have taken this up with the vatican and the vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , " she told the daily telegraph .
croatia 's catholic church and the vatican strenuously rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icty prosecutor , carla del ponte speaking on bosnian serb television after the arrest on thursday , the chairman of bosnia 's tripartite presidency , ivo miro jovic said the arrest was an embarrassment for the chief war crimes prosecutor . " will del ponte be ashamed at all after her statements , which inflicted great damage on the roman catholic church , that gotovina was hiding in monasteries here and in croatia , " he said . but observers say the arrest strengthens del ponte 's position , which was viewed as weakened after she approved croatia 's future eu membership before gotovina had been arrested .
it was seen as an indication of hope for belgrade 's eu bid even with karadzic and mladic on the loose . six fugitives on the loose del ponte said she now expected karadzic and mladic and the other fugitives to be arrested ..
of the 161 people indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , six remain at large .
but rasim ljajic , serbia-montenegro 's minister for human and minority rights , insists that belgrade is in the dark as to the two main suspects ' whereabouts . " i do not expect ratko mladic or any other indictees still at large to go to the hague by december 15 , " he said in reference to del ponte 's december 14 deadline - the 10th anniversary of the signing of the dayton peace accords that ended bosnia 's war - for the pair 's arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted posters for radko mladic and radovan karadzic the war crimes court has charged karadzic and mladic with genocide and crimes against humanity , notably in relation to the 43-month siege of sarajevo and massacre of more than 8,000 muslim males in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica in july 1995 . if del ponte decrees belgrade is being obstructive , talks on eventual eu membership could be blocked . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bosnian serbs compile srebrenica list the bosnian serb government has drawn up a list of 19,473 former soldiers who operated in the region of srebrenica at the time of the massacre there in 1995 , officials said .

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .
" it 's being played up because people are getting very excited . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .

it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .

stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .
" it 's being played up because people are getting very excited . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .
" this is a place that supports creativity , " heinig says .
" we have room here to encourage projects which go against lineal thinking .
we are not stuck in our ways . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the city has been renovated since 1989 certainly the provincial city , which dates back to the middle ages and can boast centuries of rich cultural and musical tradition , can not be accused of dragging its heels when it comes to promoting its own evolution .

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .
" this is a place that supports creativity , " heinig says .
" we have room here to encourage projects which go against lineal thinking .
we are not stuck in our ways . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the city has been renovated since 1989 certainly the provincial city , which dates back to the middle ages and can boast centuries of rich cultural and musical tradition , can not be accused of dragging its heels when it comes to promoting its own evolution .
hansel says leipzig is neither shy of flaunting its assets nor bearing its faults .
" anyone who comes to the city can see very well what we are doing .
there are construction sites everywhere , but we don ’ t try to hide them or make them look nice , " he said .
" it 's a period of unfinished change and we have already achieved a great deal in a very short space of time . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what 's next for world cup teams ?

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .

the organizing committee has admitted this but still believes that there will be hitches next summer . soccer fanatics from the 32 entrants to the world cup finals will soon know the countries who their team will be competing against as of june 9 , 2006 .
but a series of recent problems , some beyond the control of the organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- , are taking a little of the shine off spotless image that germany wants to present to the world . " we have problems , that 's right .
there are still questions that must be clarified , " ok president franz beckenbauer said in the run up to the world cup draw in leipzig on friday .
the problems are threefold : structural problems at stadiums , the ticket sales process and security questions . beckenbauer , however , feels that mountains are being made out of mole hills as the tournament nears . hooliganism a constant european hazard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in europe , clashes between police and hooligans are an unfortunately common event the fact that the world cup is back on european soil unavoidably raises the spectre of hooliganism which thrives on the continent and england .
at the 1998 world cup in france , a french policemen was almost beaten to death by german hooligans and english fans ran wild in marseille .
the last major soccer tournament to be played in germany , the 1988 european championship , brought together a dangerous mix of english , dutch and german supporters . " once we know where england and the netherlands will be , we will come up with concrete plans on security , " world cup ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told a news conference . a series of recent incidents in the bundesliga , including hamburg player alexander laas being hit by a drumstick during a match in cologne , drew criticism from fifa president sepp blatter .
safety nets are now to be erected behind the goals at all the stadiums . ticket sales criticism not receding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup tickets : a hot item that has carried its fair share of controversy with it once the groups are set after friday 's draw , the 32 participating national soccer federations will then begin sales of their ticket allocation .
at the moment , a minimum of eight percent of the tickets will be given to the national associations for each match .
schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .
" we agreed to this with the security experts and we will go through with it , even if it is labor intensive . " stadiums posing difficulties when germany won the bid to host the world cup less than five years ago , a massive effort was made to build new and refurbish older arenas .
at a few stadiums however , structural problems have developed that have led to game cancellations or less than optimal playing conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commerzbank arena is one of the most modern in germany , but when the retracting roof sticks and it rains , playing conditions are less modern just last week , a match between kaiserslautern and frankfurt was postponed due to cracks in the roof at fritz walter ­ stadium , a facility that had undergone thorough upgrades for the world cup .
frankfurt got a new stadium with a modern retractable roof that has stuck at times and then funnels plumes of water onto the pitch when it rains .
it happened once in a match against schalke , making the field almost unplayable . " this -lrb- the stadium problems -rrb- is trivial , " beckenbauer said .

now she owns the company and is among germany 's richest people . " nanny wanted for wealthy family , " read the job ad that brought friede springer , then only 23 and still named riewerts , to the axel springer verlag from her native north sea island of föhr in 1965 . fascinated by axel cäsar springer , who built a publishing empire from the ground up after world war two , friede became his girlfriend two years after taking the position to look after the publisher 's son nicolaus . a product of axel springer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while alive friede 's husband dominated much of her life she stayed at axel 's side for 13 years , becoming his fifth wife in 1978 .
a self-made billionaire , axel springer was also incredibly possessive and elitist . friede 's family was not invited to their wedding and he did not permit her to maintain contact with her old friends and forced her to phone her parents from the cellar . " i am a product of axel springer , " she said during an interview for springer 's welt am sonntag newspaper .
" it 's quite true : he created me , he made me what i am , and i say this quite openly . " strengthening the bond between them was friede 's staunch support of her husband , 30 years her senior , even when he was arguable germany 's most-hated man and the target of student protests in the late 1960s . until her husband 's death in 1985 , friede lived in a private world , secluded from the media and that dominates her life today as the head of germany 's largest publishing house , home to die welt and the bild tabloid , which has the highest circulation of any european newspaper . widow underestimated by media magnates bildunterschrift : the company was in a difficult stage when axel springer died , and the last thing friede needed after losing her husband was a series of battles over the inheritance .
but that 's what friede got . as the chief heir and executor of axel 's will , she was at the center of maneuvering from stockholders , members of the board and heirs .
they all of wanted to take over control of the publishing empire and set off a series of inheritance difficulties that would sporadically flare up over the next 20 years . underestimated by media moguls who did n't expect much of a fight from the 43-year-old widow who had dedicated herself to her husband , friede gradually bought back the company 's stock and became the majority shareholder . she and matthias döpfner , her choice for ceo , turned the company around and defended it from hostile takeover attacks by leo kirch , founder of the munich-based media company that tried to acquire a majority stake in springer ag , by attempting to stay true to axel 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the springer publishing house " i have not changed anything in his office , he is still present , " she said .

" a day later , she raised the contentious prisons issue first at an informal dinner at the headquarters of nato in brussels , attended by 32 foreign ministers from the military alliance and the european union . several european ministers declared afterwards that they were " satisfied " with her explanations on the cia 's use of airports in a process known as " rendition " - forcibly sending prisoners to places where they can be charged . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said rice 's remarks had " cleared the air . " but the top us diplomat failed to clarify whether the cia had secret prisons in europe where suspected terrorists were being held , and often chose instead to hide behind security secrecy laws . nevertheless she had the support of europe 's diplomats . " i appreciate the supportive comments that a number of colleagues have made , " she said in brussels .
" i appreciate the fact that people recognize the dilemmas we face . " rice concedes that public needs more convincing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrating against cia tactics in europe have shadowed rice on her tour .
but asked if she thought that european public opinion remained to be convinced about us policy , she conceded that more efforts might be needed .
" i think that it 's only natural that sometimes we have these discussions .
questions , concerns arise , we should discuss them in a serious way among friends . " " whether or not it will continue to be a matter of discussion i ca n't say .
i 'm perfectly happy to continue to have this discussion , " she told reporters . us officials said on thursday that they would indeed continue . rice in the direct line of fire over cia allegations rice has found herself on the front line over the secret prisons at a delicate time in transatlantic relations , after both sides have made considerable efforts to move on from the tensions raised by the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw will follow up on behalf of the eu .
in the name of the european union , british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency and is washingon 's main ally in iraq , said he would seek clarification from rice over the prisons . but with her credibility on the line over her country 's treatment of terror suspects lost in the system without trial or means of appeal , rice took shelter behind us president george w. bush .
" the united states is quite clear and quite determined to carry out the president 's policy .
the us does not engage in torture , does n't condone it , does n't expect its employees to engage in it . " further abuse scandals " entirely possible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice did not rule out more scandals but said those involved would be punished .
but she said that abuses like those committed by us personnel at the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq could not be ruled out , although she noted that those who are responsible will be punished . " will there be abuses of policy ?
that is entirely possible .
because just because you 're a democracy it does n't mean you 're perfect , " she said . " that is the only promise that we can make to people : if we find abuses we will investigate them fully and punish them . " rice 's message had clearly evolved from the one she delivered on leaving washington on monday .
" it is up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks against their own country or other countries , and decide how much sensitive information they can make public , " she said then . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice ' clears air ' over cia row in brussels european ministers relieved some of the transatlantic tension of the cia affair with rice over dinner wednesday night .

schmidt said that it was the goal of the organizing committee to bump up that percentage . 250,000 tickets are up for grabs as of december 12 . one of the major points of criticism by fans and consumer groups was the printing of names on tickets to prevent the omnipresent ticket-scalping market that appears at the world cup .
schmidt said the ok would not abandon this plan despite blatter questioning the practice , saying at the same time the german organizers were complicating the scheme by trying to be too perfect . " it 's a huge task but we want to meet our aims , " schmidt told journalists .

" i have very good news , since ante gotovina was arrested last night in spain , " she said . the news was welcomed worldwide , with nato foreign ministers gathered in brussels , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , breaking into spontaneous applause as they were told .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the arrest " very good news " , while british foreign secretary jack straw , whose nation holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , congratulated spanish and croatian authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect , gotovina gotovina , who was using a fake croatian passport in the name of kirstian horouat , was flown to the spanish capital , madrid , in a military aircraft , where he appeared before a judge at the city 's national court for a brief hearing .
he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .
he is accused of involvement in the deaths of about 150 serb civilians during a croatian offensive in 1995 , and is one of the war crimes tribunal 's three most-wanted fugitives .

del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily .

" will del ponte be ashamed at all after her statements , which inflicted great damage on the roman catholic church , that gotovina was hiding in monasteries here and in croatia , " he said . but observers say the arrest strengthens del ponte 's position , which was viewed as weakened after she approved croatia 's future eu membership before gotovina had been arrested .

" a day later , she raised the contentious prisons issue first at an informal dinner at the headquarters of nato in brussels , attended by 32 foreign ministers from the military alliance and the european union . several european ministers declared afterwards that they were " satisfied " with her explanations on the cia 's use of airports in a process known as " rendition " - forcibly sending prisoners to places where they can be charged . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said rice 's remarks had " cleared the air .

given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .

this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .
" this is a place that supports creativity , " heinig says .
" we have room here to encourage projects which go against lineal thinking .
we are not stuck in our ways . "

hansel says leipzig is neither shy of flaunting its assets nor bearing its faults .
" anyone who comes to the city can see very well what we are doing .

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .

" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel . " and israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev said : " i hope that these outrageous remarks will be a wake-up call to people who have any illusions about the nature of the regime in iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
israel 's views were echoed by the united states , its closest ally . " it just further underscores our concerns about the regime in iran .

and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also condemned the remarks . annan expresses ' shock ' un secretary general kofi annan was " shocked to see the remarks " according to a un statement .

" is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .

but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .

it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .

" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .

" is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .

beckenbauer was the undoubted architect behind germany 's successful bid , working tirelessly to help his homeland edge south africa by a single vote . " bringing back the tournament was probably my greatest moment , " beckenbauer said , referring to the 1974 world cup , which west germany hosted at a time when germany was still divided in two countries , east and west . " as player or as coach you can in theory compete at a world cup every four years .
but to bring the world cup to your country and to organize it , you get that chance only once in your lifetime . " hardly anybody does it better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going for the glory has been his motto , here with the footballer of the year trophy in 1976 when you consider that beckenbauer won three successive european cups at bayern munich -lrb- 1974 , 75 , 76 -rrb- and was twice named european footballer of the year -lrb- 1972 , 1976 -rrb- he has a lot of ' great moments ' to choose from .

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .

" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel . " and israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev said : " i hope that these outrageous remarks will be a wake-up call to people who have any illusions about the nature of the regime in iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
israel 's views were echoed by the united states , its closest ally . " it just further underscores our concerns about the regime in iran .
and its all the more reason why its so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons , " said white house spokesman scott mcclellan . europeans express outrage merkel was far from the only european leader to pounce on the iranian leader . austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel , speaking after a meeting with us president george w. bush , called the remarks " an outrageous gaffe , which i want to repudiate in the sharpest manner . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : comments ' do n't make diplomacy easier . '
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu 's nuclear diplomacy is " not made easier " by ahmadinejad 's statements .
and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also condemned the remarks . annan expresses ' shock ' un secretary general kofi annan was " shocked to see the remarks " according to a un statement .
only last month , the un general assembly passed a resolution which " rejects any denial of the holocaust as an historical event , either in full or in part . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan and the un passed a resolution rejecting holocaust denial ahmadinejad , a straight-talking former commando who swept to the presidency after a shock election win in june , is no stranger to controversy . in october , ahmadinejad called for israel to be " wiped off the map . "
as a result , annan cancelled a scheduled visit to iran , and the country was chastized by the un security council and drew fierce condemnation from the west - already alarmed over its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program . denying the holocaust in ahmadinejad 's interview thursday , he referred to the holocaust as a matter of belief , and raised the issue of revisionist historians - who attempt to establish that figures on the number of jews killed by the nazis are wildly exaggerated - being prosecuted in europe . " is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .
" then because the jews have been oppressed during the second world war , therefore they -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have to support the occupying regime of qods -lrb- jerusalem -rrb- .
we do not accept this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a holocaust memorial was recently established in berlin the holocaust was nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . official iranian media frequently carry sympathetic interviews with holocaust revisionists , and the regime itself also refuses to recognise israel . ahmadinejad also proposed " a referendum in palestine for all the original palestinians " to decide on the future of what is now israel , the gaza strip and west bank . call for resistance but he said " the best solution is resistance so that the enemies of the palestinians accept the reality and the right of the palestinian people to have land . " ahmadinejad 's tone has also been a major departure from his pro-reform predecessor mohammad khatami , who had eased anti-western rhetoric and sought to bring iran out of international isolation by calling for a " dialogue among civilisations .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel .

french president jacques chirac termed the current proposals for the eu budget " unsatisfactory " and urged a restructuring of britain 's rebate . " the current proposals from the british presidency -lrb- of the eu -rrb- are unsatisfactory from the french point of view , " french president jacques chirac said before a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday . " it is vital that every member state carries an equal share of the cost of enlargement , " he said , adding that this implies " a long term restructuring of britain 's rebate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac visited merkel near berlin on thursday , their first meeting since she took office the meeting between chirac and merkel at a castle outside berlin was described by chirac 's spokesman as an attempt to align the positions of the two nations traditionally considered the motor of the european union ahead of its crunch budget summit on dec .

" a day later , she raised the contentious prisons issue first at an informal dinner at the headquarters of nato in brussels , attended by 32 foreign ministers from the military alliance and the european union . several european ministers declared afterwards that they were " satisfied " with her explanations on the cia 's use of airports in a process known as " rendition " - forcibly sending prisoners to places where they can be charged . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said rice 's remarks had " cleared the air . " but the top us diplomat failed to clarify whether the cia had secret prisons in europe where suspected terrorists were being held , and often chose instead to hide behind security secrecy laws . nevertheless she had the support of europe 's diplomats . " i appreciate the supportive comments that a number of colleagues have made , " she said in brussels .
" i appreciate the fact that people recognize the dilemmas we face . " rice concedes that public needs more convincing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrating against cia tactics in europe have shadowed rice on her tour .
but asked if she thought that european public opinion remained to be convinced about us policy , she conceded that more efforts might be needed .
" i think that it 's only natural that sometimes we have these discussions .
questions , concerns arise , we should discuss them in a serious way among friends . " " whether or not it will continue to be a matter of discussion i ca n't say .
i 'm perfectly happy to continue to have this discussion , " she told reporters . us officials said on thursday that they would indeed continue . rice in the direct line of fire over cia allegations rice has found herself on the front line over the secret prisons at a delicate time in transatlantic relations , after both sides have made considerable efforts to move on from the tensions raised by the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw will follow up on behalf of the eu .
in the name of the european union , british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency and is washingon 's main ally in iraq , said he would seek clarification from rice over the prisons . but with her credibility on the line over her country 's treatment of terror suspects lost in the system without trial or means of appeal , rice took shelter behind us president george w. bush .
" the united states is quite clear and quite determined to carry out the president 's policy .
the us does not engage in torture , does n't condone it , does n't expect its employees to engage in it . " further abuse scandals " entirely possible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice did not rule out more scandals but said those involved would be punished .
but she said that abuses like those committed by us personnel at the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq could not be ruled out , although she noted that those who are responsible will be punished . " will there be abuses of policy ?
that is entirely possible .
because just because you 're a democracy it does n't mean you 're perfect , " she said . " that is the only promise that we can make to people : if we find abuses we will investigate them fully and punish them . " rice 's message had clearly evolved from the one she delivered on leaving washington on monday .
" it is up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks against their own country or other countries , and decide how much sensitive information they can make public , " she said then . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice ' clears air ' over cia row in brussels european ministers relieved some of the transatlantic tension of the cia affair with rice over dinner wednesday night .

now she owns the company and is among germany 's richest people . " nanny wanted for wealthy family , " read the job ad that brought friede springer , then only 23 and still named riewerts , to the axel springer verlag from her native north sea island of föhr in 1965 . fascinated by axel cäsar springer , who built a publishing empire from the ground up after world war two , friede became his girlfriend two years after taking the position to look after the publisher 's son nicolaus . a product of axel springer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while alive friede 's husband dominated much of her life she stayed at axel 's side for 13 years , becoming his fifth wife in 1978 .
a self-made billionaire , axel springer was also incredibly possessive and elitist . friede 's family was not invited to their wedding and he did not permit her to maintain contact with her old friends and forced her to phone her parents from the cellar . " i am a product of axel springer , " she said during an interview for springer 's welt am sonntag newspaper .
" it 's quite true : he created me , he made me what i am , and i say this quite openly . " strengthening the bond between them was friede 's staunch support of her husband , 30 years her senior , even when he was arguable germany 's most-hated man and the target of student protests in the late 1960s . until her husband 's death in 1985 , friede lived in a private world , secluded from the media and that dominates her life today as the head of germany 's largest publishing house , home to die welt and the bild tabloid , which has the highest circulation of any european newspaper . widow underestimated by media magnates bildunterschrift : the company was in a difficult stage when axel springer died , and the last thing friede needed after losing her husband was a series of battles over the inheritance .
but that 's what friede got . as the chief heir and executor of axel 's will , she was at the center of maneuvering from stockholders , members of the board and heirs .
they all of wanted to take over control of the publishing empire and set off a series of inheritance difficulties that would sporadically flare up over the next 20 years . underestimated by media moguls who did n't expect much of a fight from the 43-year-old widow who had dedicated herself to her husband , friede gradually bought back the company 's stock and became the majority shareholder . she and matthias döpfner , her choice for ceo , turned the company around and defended it from hostile takeover attacks by leo kirch , founder of the munich-based media company that tried to acquire a majority stake in springer ag , by attempting to stay true to axel 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the springer publishing house " i have not changed anything in his office , he is still present , " she said .
" when i have to make a decision i think of him and ask how he would decide . " in august 2005 , springer created a stir from her office on the 19th floor of the building on berlin 's kochstrasse by announcing her intention to take over the prosieben / sat.1 broadcasting group , one of germany 's largest private free-to-air broadcasters .
anti-cartel officials have , however , hinted they would not allow the acquisition to be approved . in recognition of her social work , friede has received a number of honors including the leo baeck prize from the central council of jews in germany . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-trust office has qualms about springer 's tv plans according to germany 's axel springer publishing company , the country 's anti-trust office has qualms about allowing the media giant to acquire television broadcaster prosiebensat.1.

french president jacques chirac termed the current proposals for the eu budget " unsatisfactory " and urged a restructuring of britain 's rebate . " the current proposals from the british presidency -lrb- of the eu -rrb- are unsatisfactory from the french point of view , " french president jacques chirac said before a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel on thursday . " it is vital that every member state carries an equal share of the cost of enlargement , " he said , adding that this implies " a long term restructuring of britain 's rebate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac visited merkel near berlin on thursday , their first meeting since she took office the meeting between chirac and merkel at a castle outside berlin was described by chirac 's spokesman as an attempt to align the positions of the two nations traditionally considered the motor of the european union ahead of its crunch budget summit on dec .
15 and 16 . merkel was more cautious in her remarks , saying she did not want to single out specific elements of the budget proposals for criticism , and urging member states " to use every opportunity " to reach an accord . merkel : plan has ' rough patches ' " when one is preparing for negotiations it is often better not to single out specific details and not to assume a definitive stance , " she told a joint press conference of the two leaders . earlier this week she also called on the british government to revise their proposals . " we could , from the german side , imagine improvements on some points .
a first examination shows that this draft still has many rough patches throughout , " she said on tuesday . of rebates and farm subsidies under the british proposal , overall eu spending between 2007 and 2013 would be cut to 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income , or an estimated 846.8 billion euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french dairy farmers benefit from eu milk quotas britain would forgo eight billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain has also called for a midterm spending review , opening the door to potential cuts in farm aid , of which france is the main beneficiary . chirac told british prime minister tony blair on tuesday that he hoped " the presidency could make new proposals that would above all ensure that britain plays its full part in financing an enlarged europe - and not just till 2013 but over the long term , " a spokesman for the french president said on tuesday . chirac wants ' joint approach ' chirac 's spokesman said the president hoped to " build a joint franco-german approach " on the budget before next week 's summit in brussels . germany is the european union 's biggest economy and has long been its biggest net contributor .
it does not want to see its contributions increased , while france is resisting reform of the bloc 's generous farm subsidies . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .

now she owns the company and is among germany 's richest people . " nanny wanted for wealthy family , " read the job ad that brought friede springer , then only 23 and still named riewerts , to the axel springer verlag from her native north sea island of föhr in 1965 . fascinated by axel cäsar springer , who built a publishing empire from the ground up after world war two , friede became his girlfriend two years after taking the position to look after the publisher 's son nicolaus . a product of axel springer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while alive friede 's husband dominated much of her life she stayed at axel 's side for 13 years , becoming his fifth wife in 1978 .
a self-made billionaire , axel springer was also incredibly possessive and elitist . friede 's family was not invited to their wedding and he did not permit her to maintain contact with her old friends and forced her to phone her parents from the cellar . " i am a product of axel springer , " she said during an interview for springer 's welt am sonntag newspaper .
" it 's quite true : he created me , he made me what i am , and i say this quite openly . " strengthening the bond between them was friede 's staunch support of her husband , 30 years her senior , even when he was arguable germany 's most-hated man and the target of student protests in the late 1960s . until her husband 's death in 1985 , friede lived in a private world , secluded from the media and that dominates her life today as the head of germany 's largest publishing house , home to die welt and the bild tabloid , which has the highest circulation of any european newspaper . widow underestimated by media magnates bildunterschrift : the company was in a difficult stage when axel springer died , and the last thing friede needed after losing her husband was a series of battles over the inheritance .
but that 's what friede got . as the chief heir and executor of axel 's will , she was at the center of maneuvering from stockholders , members of the board and heirs .
they all of wanted to take over control of the publishing empire and set off a series of inheritance difficulties that would sporadically flare up over the next 20 years . underestimated by media moguls who did n't expect much of a fight from the 43-year-old widow who had dedicated herself to her husband , friede gradually bought back the company 's stock and became the majority shareholder . she and matthias döpfner , her choice for ceo , turned the company around and defended it from hostile takeover attacks by leo kirch , founder of the munich-based media company that tried to acquire a majority stake in springer ag , by attempting to stay true to axel 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the springer publishing house " i have not changed anything in his office , he is still present , " she said .
" when i have to make a decision i think of him and ask how he would decide . " in august 2005 , springer created a stir from her office on the 19th floor of the building on berlin 's kochstrasse by announcing her intention to take over the prosieben / sat.1 broadcasting group , one of germany 's largest private free-to-air broadcasters .

the arrest is seen as a boost for zagreb 's efforts to join the eu . chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , carla del ponte announced the news of gotovina 's capture during a visit to belgrade .
" i have very good news , since ante gotovina was arrested last night in spain , " she said . the news was welcomed worldwide , with nato foreign ministers gathered in brussels , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , breaking into spontaneous applause as they were told .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the arrest " very good news " , while british foreign secretary jack straw , whose nation holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , congratulated spanish and croatian authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect , gotovina gotovina , who was using a fake croatian passport in the name of kirstian horouat , was flown to the spanish capital , madrid , in a military aircraft , where he appeared before a judge at the city 's national court for a brief hearing .
he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .
he is accused of involvement in the deaths of about 150 serb civilians during a croatian offensive in 1995 , and is one of the war crimes tribunal 's three most-wanted fugitives .
radovan karadzic , the political leader of the serbs during bosnia 's 1992-1995 war , and his military chief , ratko mladic are still at large . croatian prime minister , ivo sanader , said the arrest endorsed the eu 's decision to start accession talks in october following a seven month delay on the grounds that brussels was dissatisfied with the level of zagreb 's cooperation in tracking down the ex-general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " it is the final confirmation of the credibility of croatia and its state institutions , " croatian prime minister ivo sanader said .
" those who believed us when we were saying that gotovina was not in croatia today received the final and complete confirmation . " conflict with catholic church in september , the prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia expressed frustration over croatia 's apparent inability to find and arrest the 50-year-old former general .
del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily . " i have taken this up with the vatican and the vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , " she told the daily telegraph .

he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .
he is accused of involvement in the deaths of about 150 serb civilians during a croatian offensive in 1995 , and is one of the war crimes tribunal 's three most-wanted fugitives .
radovan karadzic , the political leader of the serbs during bosnia 's 1992-1995 war , and his military chief , ratko mladic are still at large . croatian prime minister , ivo sanader , said the arrest endorsed the eu 's decision to start accession talks in october following a seven month delay on the grounds that brussels was dissatisfied with the level of zagreb 's cooperation in tracking down the ex-general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " it is the final confirmation of the credibility of croatia and its state institutions , " croatian prime minister ivo sanader said .
" those who believed us when we were saying that gotovina was not in croatia today received the final and complete confirmation . " conflict with catholic church in september , the prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia expressed frustration over croatia 's apparent inability to find and arrest the 50-year-old former general .
del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily . " i have taken this up with the vatican and the vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , " she told the daily telegraph .
croatia 's catholic church and the vatican strenuously rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icty prosecutor , carla del ponte speaking on bosnian serb television after the arrest on thursday , the chairman of bosnia 's tripartite presidency , ivo miro jovic said the arrest was an embarrassment for the chief war crimes prosecutor . " will del ponte be ashamed at all after her statements , which inflicted great damage on the roman catholic church , that gotovina was hiding in monasteries here and in croatia , " he said . but observers say the arrest strengthens del ponte 's position , which was viewed as weakened after she approved croatia 's future eu membership before gotovina had been arrested .
it was seen as an indication of hope for belgrade 's eu bid even with karadzic and mladic on the loose . six fugitives on the loose del ponte said she now expected karadzic and mladic and the other fugitives to be arrested ..
of the 161 people indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , six remain at large .
but rasim ljajic , serbia-montenegro 's minister for human and minority rights , insists that belgrade is in the dark as to the two main suspects ' whereabouts . " i do not expect ratko mladic or any other indictees still at large to go to the hague by december 15 , " he said in reference to del ponte 's december 14 deadline - the 10th anniversary of the signing of the dayton peace accords that ended bosnia 's war - for the pair 's arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted posters for radko mladic and radovan karadzic the war crimes court has charged karadzic and mladic with genocide and crimes against humanity , notably in relation to the 43-month siege of sarajevo and massacre of more than 8,000 muslim males in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica in july 1995 . if del ponte decrees belgrade is being obstructive , talks on eventual eu membership could be blocked . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bosnian serbs compile srebrenica list the bosnian serb government has drawn up a list of 19,473 former soldiers who operated in the region of srebrenica at the time of the massacre there in 1995 , officials said .

" a day later , she raised the contentious prisons issue first at an informal dinner at the headquarters of nato in brussels , attended by 32 foreign ministers from the military alliance and the european union . several european ministers declared afterwards that they were " satisfied " with her explanations on the cia 's use of airports in a process known as " rendition " - forcibly sending prisoners to places where they can be charged . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said rice 's remarks had " cleared the air . " but the top us diplomat failed to clarify whether the cia had secret prisons in europe where suspected terrorists were being held , and often chose instead to hide behind security secrecy laws . nevertheless she had the support of europe 's diplomats . " i appreciate the supportive comments that a number of colleagues have made , " she said in brussels .
" i appreciate the fact that people recognize the dilemmas we face . " rice concedes that public needs more convincing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrating against cia tactics in europe have shadowed rice on her tour .
but asked if she thought that european public opinion remained to be convinced about us policy , she conceded that more efforts might be needed .
" i think that it 's only natural that sometimes we have these discussions .
questions , concerns arise , we should discuss them in a serious way among friends . " " whether or not it will continue to be a matter of discussion i ca n't say .
i 'm perfectly happy to continue to have this discussion , " she told reporters . us officials said on thursday that they would indeed continue . rice in the direct line of fire over cia allegations rice has found herself on the front line over the secret prisons at a delicate time in transatlantic relations , after both sides have made considerable efforts to move on from the tensions raised by the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw will follow up on behalf of the eu .
in the name of the european union , british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency and is washingon 's main ally in iraq , said he would seek clarification from rice over the prisons . but with her credibility on the line over her country 's treatment of terror suspects lost in the system without trial or means of appeal , rice took shelter behind us president george w. bush .
" the united states is quite clear and quite determined to carry out the president 's policy .
the us does not engage in torture , does n't condone it , does n't expect its employees to engage in it . " further abuse scandals " entirely possible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice did not rule out more scandals but said those involved would be punished .
but she said that abuses like those committed by us personnel at the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq could not be ruled out , although she noted that those who are responsible will be punished . " will there be abuses of policy ?
that is entirely possible .
because just because you 're a democracy it does n't mean you 're perfect , " she said . " that is the only promise that we can make to people : if we find abuses we will investigate them fully and punish them . " rice 's message had clearly evolved from the one she delivered on leaving washington on monday .
" it is up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks against their own country or other countries , and decide how much sensitive information they can make public , " she said then . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice ' clears air ' over cia row in brussels european ministers relieved some of the transatlantic tension of the cia affair with rice over dinner wednesday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.12.2005 leipzig leads the way for former east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo leads the way to leipzig .
thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .
" this is a place that supports creativity , " heinig says .
" we have room here to encourage projects which go against lineal thinking .
we are not stuck in our ways . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the city has been renovated since 1989 certainly the provincial city , which dates back to the middle ages and can boast centuries of rich cultural and musical tradition , can not be accused of dragging its heels when it comes to promoting its own evolution .
hansel says leipzig is neither shy of flaunting its assets nor bearing its faults .
" anyone who comes to the city can see very well what we are doing .
there are construction sites everywhere , but we don ’ t try to hide them or make them look nice , " he said .
" it 's a period of unfinished change and we have already achieved a great deal in a very short space of time . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what 's next for world cup teams ?

" a day later , she raised the contentious prisons issue first at an informal dinner at the headquarters of nato in brussels , attended by 32 foreign ministers from the military alliance and the european union . several european ministers declared afterwards that they were " satisfied " with her explanations on the cia 's use of airports in a process known as " rendition " - forcibly sending prisoners to places where they can be charged . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said rice 's remarks had " cleared the air . " but the top us diplomat failed to clarify whether the cia had secret prisons in europe where suspected terrorists were being held , and often chose instead to hide behind security secrecy laws . nevertheless she had the support of europe 's diplomats . " i appreciate the supportive comments that a number of colleagues have made , " she said in brussels .
" i appreciate the fact that people recognize the dilemmas we face . " rice concedes that public needs more convincing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demonstrating against cia tactics in europe have shadowed rice on her tour .
but asked if she thought that european public opinion remained to be convinced about us policy , she conceded that more efforts might be needed .
" i think that it 's only natural that sometimes we have these discussions .
questions , concerns arise , we should discuss them in a serious way among friends . " " whether or not it will continue to be a matter of discussion i ca n't say .
i 'm perfectly happy to continue to have this discussion , " she told reporters . us officials said on thursday that they would indeed continue . rice in the direct line of fire over cia allegations rice has found herself on the front line over the secret prisons at a delicate time in transatlantic relations , after both sides have made considerable efforts to move on from the tensions raised by the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw will follow up on behalf of the eu .
in the name of the european union , british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country holds the bloc 's rotating presidency and is washingon 's main ally in iraq , said he would seek clarification from rice over the prisons . but with her credibility on the line over her country 's treatment of terror suspects lost in the system without trial or means of appeal , rice took shelter behind us president george w. bush .
" the united states is quite clear and quite determined to carry out the president 's policy .
the us does not engage in torture , does n't condone it , does n't expect its employees to engage in it . " further abuse scandals " entirely possible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice did not rule out more scandals but said those involved would be punished .
but she said that abuses like those committed by us personnel at the notorious abu ghraib prison in iraq could not be ruled out , although she noted that those who are responsible will be punished . " will there be abuses of policy ?
that is entirely possible .
because just because you 're a democracy it does n't mean you 're perfect , " she said . " that is the only promise that we can make to people : if we find abuses we will investigate them fully and punish them . " rice 's message had clearly evolved from the one she delivered on leaving washington on monday .
" it is up to those governments and their citizens to decide if they wish to work with us to prevent terrorist attacks against their own country or other countries , and decide how much sensitive information they can make public , " she said then . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice ' clears air ' over cia row in brussels european ministers relieved some of the transatlantic tension of the cia affair with rice over dinner wednesday night .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel . " and israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev said : " i hope that these outrageous remarks will be a wake-up call to people who have any illusions about the nature of the regime in iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
israel 's views were echoed by the united states , its closest ally . " it just further underscores our concerns about the regime in iran .
and its all the more reason why its so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons , " said white house spokesman scott mcclellan . europeans express outrage merkel was far from the only european leader to pounce on the iranian leader . austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel , speaking after a meeting with us president george w. bush , called the remarks " an outrageous gaffe , which i want to repudiate in the sharpest manner . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : comments ' do n't make diplomacy easier . '
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu 's nuclear diplomacy is " not made easier " by ahmadinejad 's statements .
and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also condemned the remarks . annan expresses ' shock ' un secretary general kofi annan was " shocked to see the remarks " according to a un statement .
only last month , the un general assembly passed a resolution which " rejects any denial of the holocaust as an historical event , either in full or in part . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan and the un passed a resolution rejecting holocaust denial ahmadinejad , a straight-talking former commando who swept to the presidency after a shock election win in june , is no stranger to controversy . in october , ahmadinejad called for israel to be " wiped off the map . "
as a result , annan cancelled a scheduled visit to iran , and the country was chastized by the un security council and drew fierce condemnation from the west - already alarmed over its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program . denying the holocaust in ahmadinejad 's interview thursday , he referred to the holocaust as a matter of belief , and raised the issue of revisionist historians - who attempt to establish that figures on the number of jews killed by the nazis are wildly exaggerated - being prosecuted in europe . " is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .
" then because the jews have been oppressed during the second world war , therefore they -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have to support the occupying regime of qods -lrb- jerusalem -rrb- .
we do not accept this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a holocaust memorial was recently established in berlin the holocaust was nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . official iranian media frequently carry sympathetic interviews with holocaust revisionists , and the regime itself also refuses to recognise israel . ahmadinejad also proposed " a referendum in palestine for all the original palestinians " to decide on the future of what is now israel , the gaza strip and west bank . call for resistance but he said " the best solution is resistance so that the enemies of the palestinians accept the reality and the right of the palestinian people to have land .

the arrest is seen as a boost for zagreb 's efforts to join the eu . chief prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , carla del ponte announced the news of gotovina 's capture during a visit to belgrade .
" i have very good news , since ante gotovina was arrested last night in spain , " she said . the news was welcomed worldwide , with nato foreign ministers gathered in brussels , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , breaking into spontaneous applause as they were told .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the arrest " very good news " , while british foreign secretary jack straw , whose nation holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , congratulated spanish and croatian authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect , gotovina gotovina , who was using a fake croatian passport in the name of kirstian horouat , was flown to the spanish capital , madrid , in a military aircraft , where he appeared before a judge at the city 's national court for a brief hearing .
he was remanded in custody to the soto del real prison north of madrid , pending his transferal to the hague in the netherlands , which could be as early as friday . four years on the run gotovina , once a soldier in the french foreign legion , had been on the run since mid-2001 when the hague announced his indictment for war crimes committed against ethnic serbs at the end of the 1991-1995 serbo-croatian conflict .
he is accused of involvement in the deaths of about 150 serb civilians during a croatian offensive in 1995 , and is one of the war crimes tribunal 's three most-wanted fugitives .
radovan karadzic , the political leader of the serbs during bosnia 's 1992-1995 war , and his military chief , ratko mladic are still at large . croatian prime minister , ivo sanader , said the arrest endorsed the eu 's decision to start accession talks in october following a seven month delay on the grounds that brussels was dissatisfied with the level of zagreb 's cooperation in tracking down the ex-general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " it is the final confirmation of the credibility of croatia and its state institutions , " croatian prime minister ivo sanader said .
" those who believed us when we were saying that gotovina was not in croatia today received the final and complete confirmation . " conflict with catholic church in september , the prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia expressed frustration over croatia 's apparent inability to find and arrest the 50-year-old former general .
del ponte told a british newspaper she suspected gotovina , considered a war hero by many of his compatriots , was hiding in a franciscan monastery in croatia and that the vatican could probably pinpoint his location easily . " i have taken this up with the vatican and the vatican totally refuses to co-operate with us , " she told the daily telegraph .
croatia 's catholic church and the vatican strenuously rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icty prosecutor , carla del ponte speaking on bosnian serb television after the arrest on thursday , the chairman of bosnia 's tripartite presidency , ivo miro jovic said the arrest was an embarrassment for the chief war crimes prosecutor . " will del ponte be ashamed at all after her statements , which inflicted great damage on the roman catholic church , that gotovina was hiding in monasteries here and in croatia , " he said . but observers say the arrest strengthens del ponte 's position , which was viewed as weakened after she approved croatia 's future eu membership before gotovina had been arrested .
it was seen as an indication of hope for belgrade 's eu bid even with karadzic and mladic on the loose . six fugitives on the loose del ponte said she now expected karadzic and mladic and the other fugitives to be arrested ..
of the 161 people indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , six remain at large .
but rasim ljajic , serbia-montenegro 's minister for human and minority rights , insists that belgrade is in the dark as to the two main suspects ' whereabouts . " i do not expect ratko mladic or any other indictees still at large to go to the hague by december 15 , " he said in reference to del ponte 's december 14 deadline - the 10th anniversary of the signing of the dayton peace accords that ended bosnia 's war - for the pair 's arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted posters for radko mladic and radovan karadzic the war crimes court has charged karadzic and mladic with genocide and crimes against humanity , notably in relation to the 43-month siege of sarajevo and massacre of more than 8,000 muslim males in the eastern bosnian enclave of srebrenica in july 1995 . if del ponte decrees belgrade is being obstructive , talks on eventual eu membership could be blocked . afp / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bosnian serbs compile srebrenica list the bosnian serb government has drawn up a list of 19,473 former soldiers who operated in the region of srebrenica at the time of the massacre there in 1995 , officials said .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel . " and israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev said : " i hope that these outrageous remarks will be a wake-up call to people who have any illusions about the nature of the regime in iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
israel 's views were echoed by the united states , its closest ally . " it just further underscores our concerns about the regime in iran .
and its all the more reason why its so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons , " said white house spokesman scott mcclellan . europeans express outrage merkel was far from the only european leader to pounce on the iranian leader . austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel , speaking after a meeting with us president george w. bush , called the remarks " an outrageous gaffe , which i want to repudiate in the sharpest manner . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : comments ' do n't make diplomacy easier . '
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu 's nuclear diplomacy is " not made easier " by ahmadinejad 's statements .
and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also condemned the remarks . annan expresses ' shock ' un secretary general kofi annan was " shocked to see the remarks " according to a un statement .

"
as a result , annan cancelled a scheduled visit to iran , and the country was chastized by the un security council and drew fierce condemnation from the west - already alarmed over its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program . denying the holocaust in ahmadinejad 's interview thursday , he referred to the holocaust as a matter of belief , and raised the issue of revisionist historians - who attempt to establish that figures on the number of jews killed by the nazis are wildly exaggerated - being prosecuted in europe . " is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .
" then because the jews have been oppressed during the second world war , therefore they -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have to support the occupying regime of qods -lrb- jerusalem -rrb- .

" you believe the jews were oppressed , why should the palestinian muslims have to pay the price ? " he asked in an interview with iranian state television 's arabic-language satellite channel , al-alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke in october at a ' world without zionism ' conference .
" you oppressed them , so give a part of europe to the zionist regime so they can establish any government they want .
we would support it , " he said , according to a transcript of his original farsi-language comments given to the afp news service . controversial leader " so , germany and austria , come and give one , two or any number of your provinces to the zionist regime so they can create a country there ... and the problem will be solved at its root , " he said .
" why do they insist on imposing themselves on other powers and creating a tumor so there is always tension and conflict ? " in response , the central council of jews in germany called for germany to break of diplomatic relations with iran . and german chancellor angela merkel condemned the remarks as " fully unacceptable . "
a foreign ministry spokesman said they plan to call in the iranian ambassador for a formal rebuke . " there must be steps taken to make it clear to iran 's leadership that the comments are in breach of international law , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany told the netzeitung on friday . spiegel said he welcomed merkel 's condemnation of the comments , but added , " indignation alone is n't enough . " israeli reaction for its part , israel called the iranian president " very dangerous . " " this was not a misstatement or a passing remark , " israeli foreign minister silvan shalom told israel radio .
" it is a systematic way of thinking which is intended to bring about the annihilation of the state of israel . " and israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev said : " i hope that these outrageous remarks will be a wake-up call to people who have any illusions about the nature of the regime in iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's isfahan nuclear facility .
israel 's views were echoed by the united states , its closest ally . " it just further underscores our concerns about the regime in iran .
and its all the more reason why its so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons , " said white house spokesman scott mcclellan . europeans express outrage merkel was far from the only european leader to pounce on the iranian leader . austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel , speaking after a meeting with us president george w. bush , called the remarks " an outrageous gaffe , which i want to repudiate in the sharpest manner . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : comments ' do n't make diplomacy easier . '
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu 's nuclear diplomacy is " not made easier " by ahmadinejad 's statements .
and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi also condemned the remarks . annan expresses ' shock ' un secretary general kofi annan was " shocked to see the remarks " according to a un statement .
only last month , the un general assembly passed a resolution which " rejects any denial of the holocaust as an historical event , either in full or in part . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan and the un passed a resolution rejecting holocaust denial ahmadinejad , a straight-talking former commando who swept to the presidency after a shock election win in june , is no stranger to controversy . in october , ahmadinejad called for israel to be " wiped off the map . "
as a result , annan cancelled a scheduled visit to iran , and the country was chastized by the un security council and drew fierce condemnation from the west - already alarmed over its nuclear ambitions and ballistic missile program . denying the holocaust in ahmadinejad 's interview thursday , he referred to the holocaust as a matter of belief , and raised the issue of revisionist historians - who attempt to establish that figures on the number of jews killed by the nazis are wildly exaggerated - being prosecuted in europe . " is it not true that european countries insist that they committed a jewish genocide ?
they say that hitler burned millions of jews in furnaces ... and exiled them , " he said .
" then because the jews have been oppressed during the second world war , therefore they -lrb- the europeans -rrb- have to support the occupying regime of qods -lrb- jerusalem -rrb- .
we do not accept this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a holocaust memorial was recently established in berlin the holocaust was nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . official iranian media frequently carry sympathetic interviews with holocaust revisionists , and the regime itself also refuses to recognise israel . ahmadinejad also proposed " a referendum in palestine for all the original palestinians " to decide on the future of what is now israel , the gaza strip and west bank . call for resistance but he said " the best solution is resistance so that the enemies of the palestinians accept the reality and the right of the palestinian people to have land . " ahmadinejad 's tone has also been a major departure from his pro-reform predecessor mohammad khatami , who had eased anti-western rhetoric and sought to bring iran out of international isolation by calling for a " dialogue among civilisations .

they all of wanted to take over control of the publishing empire and set off a series of inheritance difficulties that would sporadically flare up over the next 20 years . underestimated by media moguls who did n't expect much of a fight from the 43-year-old widow who had dedicated herself to her husband , friede gradually bought back the company 's stock and became the majority shareholder . she and matthias döpfner , her choice for ceo , turned the company around and defended it from hostile takeover attacks by leo kirch , founder of the munich-based media company that tried to acquire a majority stake in springer ag , by attempting to stay true to axel 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the springer publishing house " i have not changed anything in his office , he is still present , " she said .

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .
" this is a place that supports creativity , " heinig says .
" we have room here to encourage projects which go against lineal thinking .
we are not stuck in our ways . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the city has been renovated since 1989 certainly the provincial city , which dates back to the middle ages and can boast centuries of rich cultural and musical tradition , can not be accused of dragging its heels when it comes to promoting its own evolution .
hansel says leipzig is neither shy of flaunting its assets nor bearing its faults .
" anyone who comes to the city can see very well what we are doing .
there are construction sites everywhere , but we don ’ t try to hide them or make them look nice , " he said .
" it 's a period of unfinished change and we have already achieved a great deal in a very short space of time . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what 's next for world cup teams ?
now that qualifications for the 2006 world cup are over , teams will focus their sights on the group lottery in leipzig on dec .

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .
" this is a place that supports creativity , " heinig says .
" we have room here to encourage projects which go against lineal thinking .
we are not stuck in our ways . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the city has been renovated since 1989 certainly the provincial city , which dates back to the middle ages and can boast centuries of rich cultural and musical tradition , can not be accused of dragging its heels when it comes to promoting its own evolution .
hansel says leipzig is neither shy of flaunting its assets nor bearing its faults .
" anyone who comes to the city can see very well what we are doing .
there are construction sites everywhere , but we don ’ t try to hide them or make them look nice , " he said .
" it 's a period of unfinished change and we have already achieved a great deal in a very short space of time . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what 's next for world cup teams ?

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .

now she owns the company and is among germany 's richest people . " nanny wanted for wealthy family , " read the job ad that brought friede springer , then only 23 and still named riewerts , to the axel springer verlag from her native north sea island of föhr in 1965 . fascinated by axel cäsar springer , who built a publishing empire from the ground up after world war two , friede became his girlfriend two years after taking the position to look after the publisher 's son nicolaus . a product of axel springer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while alive friede 's husband dominated much of her life she stayed at axel 's side for 13 years , becoming his fifth wife in 1978 .
a self-made billionaire , axel springer was also incredibly possessive and elitist . friede 's family was not invited to their wedding and he did not permit her to maintain contact with her old friends and forced her to phone her parents from the cellar . " i am a product of axel springer , " she said during an interview for springer 's welt am sonntag newspaper .
" it 's quite true : he created me , he made me what i am , and i say this quite openly . " strengthening the bond between them was friede 's staunch support of her husband , 30 years her senior , even when he was arguable germany 's most-hated man and the target of student protests in the late 1960s . until her husband 's death in 1985 , friede lived in a private world , secluded from the media and that dominates her life today as the head of germany 's largest publishing house , home to die welt and the bild tabloid , which has the highest circulation of any european newspaper . widow underestimated by media magnates bildunterschrift : the company was in a difficult stage when axel springer died , and the last thing friede needed after losing her husband was a series of battles over the inheritance .
but that 's what friede got . as the chief heir and executor of axel 's will , she was at the center of maneuvering from stockholders , members of the board and heirs .
they all of wanted to take over control of the publishing empire and set off a series of inheritance difficulties that would sporadically flare up over the next 20 years . underestimated by media moguls who did n't expect much of a fight from the 43-year-old widow who had dedicated herself to her husband , friede gradually bought back the company 's stock and became the majority shareholder . she and matthias döpfner , her choice for ceo , turned the company around and defended it from hostile takeover attacks by leo kirch , founder of the munich-based media company that tried to acquire a majority stake in springer ag , by attempting to stay true to axel 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the springer publishing house " i have not changed anything in his office , he is still present , " she said .
" when i have to make a decision i think of him and ask how he would decide . " in august 2005 , springer created a stir from her office on the 19th floor of the building on berlin 's kochstrasse by announcing her intention to take over the prosieben / sat.1 broadcasting group , one of germany 's largest private free-to-air broadcasters .

thousands are expected to follow come the world cup final draw on friday , all eyes will be fixed on an ambitious city in germany ’ s former east .
on a fast-track ascent from the ashes of its past , leipzig is keen to present its new face to the world . as much as anything else right now , leipzig is a city under construction .
building work dominates center stage and the tuneless tones of banging and drilling fill the air .
but come friday evening , all that will grind to a halt as residents and visitors from all over the world flock to the city gates to honor one of the most high-profile moments in leipzig 's modern history .
being selected as the location for the world cup final draw serves as a symbol of recognition and , some even say , a unified germany .
it was certainly not the only city in the running .
given its modest population of less than half a million and the fact that for many in the outside world , it does n't feature on the radar in the same way as munich , its main contender in the selection race , being chosen was a bit of a coup for leipzig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction is an integral part of the modern city christopher hansel , who heads the department of urban planning for leipzig 's world cup office , believes it was a good choice of location for the final draw .
" leipzig is representative of the changes which have taken place since reunification , " he said .
" and for a very short period of time , we will be in the headlines the world over . "
embracing challenge and change to an extent , the city is headline news in itself .
not only is it the only place in the former eastern germany where soccer matches will be held during the championships next summer , but a solid city which has proved its mettle in rising to the challenges of reunification .
" leipzig is a city of change , people are very tolerant of that .
we stick our necks out and try things which other cities would n't dare do , " said hansel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city had ambitious plans for its olympic park it is precisely that attitude which led the authorities there to place a bid for the 2012 olympics .
and although the attempt , which failed at the first hurdle , drew ridicule from some quarters , it was a clear " watch this space " statement from a city in a region generally equated with industrial and economic depression .
it is in that same vain that the city has managed to draw corporate giants such as bmw , dhl and porsche to set up nearby plants .
the city has also added a rebuilt stadium and one of the most modern exhibition centers in europe to its list of credentials , and created a pretty inner city with a marked cafe society flair .
building on history marita müller , who has lived in leipzig since the seventies , believes the characteristics of the people and the events of the city ’ s recent past contribute significantly to the changing face of the place .
she cites the peaceful " monday demonstrations " which ultimately secured an end to the communist era as a strong platform for a belief in the ability to bring about change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's exhibition center " but there is more to it than that , " she said .
" even during the gdr , when leipzig was the only city with an exhibition center , inhabitants had regular contact with foreigners .
this encouraged a sense of openness and tolerance , it broadened their horizons and enabled them to maintain a lively spirit . "
stefan heinig , of the leipzig city planning department , says that lively spirit which can bubble over into wild ambition is sometimes read as megalomania .
" maybe there 's an element of such , but this city riding on a tradition of self-belief , " he said .
" people here are not afraid of setting their sights high and mucking in to help achieve their goals . "
a creative city even unemployment rates of 20 percent do n't seem enough to dampen the mood .
heinig says recent surveys show that those who live in leipzig are actually happier than the economic situation should allow for .
so much so in fact , that people have begun moving into the city rather than simply leaving in droves .
" this is a place that supports creativity , " heinig says .
" we have room here to encourage projects which go against lineal thinking .
we are not stuck in our ways . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the city has been renovated since 1989 certainly the provincial city , which dates back to the middle ages and can boast centuries of rich cultural and musical tradition , can not be accused of dragging its heels when it comes to promoting its own evolution .
hansel says leipzig is neither shy of flaunting its assets nor bearing its faults .
" anyone who comes to the city can see very well what we are doing .
there are construction sites everywhere , but we don ’ t try to hide them or make them look nice , " he said .
" it 's a period of unfinished change and we have already achieved a great deal in a very short space of time . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : what 's next for world cup teams ?

the environment agency has agreed to initial plans for the scheme and said it would consult residents and local authorities over more detailed designs .
the north yorkshire city has a history of flooding , with five significant incidents between 1982 and 2005 .
it is hoped work on the defences will begin in 2007 and benefit about 320 homes and 80 businesses when completed .
' be patient ' the rivers skell , laver and ure all meet at ripon .
in the autumn of 2000 , 100 properties were flooded from the river skell and homes close to the river had to be evacuated in the middle of the night the environment agency 's project manager for the scheme , andrew newton , said he was delighted at the progress , but warned there was a lot to work out before construction could start .
" having suffered flooding as recently as january this year the people of ripon are very keen to see our works begin , but i need to ask residents to be patient , " he said .
part of the process within the next year is to obtain planning permission for the scheme , which involves constructing a flood embankment further up the valley as well as works within the city , he added .

mr morgan said : " you have to wait for the consensus . "
their comments came after the publication by the uk government on thursday of the government of wales bill for the biggest transfer of power from westminster to wales since 1999 when the assembly was set up .
the bill is expected to transform the ability of the assembly to pass new laws , and will see significant changes to the electoral system .

using the us space agency 's aura satellite , the team can look right down to the troposphere , the lowest part of the atmosphere where we all live .
the ozone monitoring instrument -lrb- omi -rrb- and other key equipment on aura can build a daily picture of air quality .
the pollution maps , which can see detail at the city scale , will be used to identify problem hotspots .
" this is the first time that we have been able to follow pollution globally from day to day , " said pieternel levelt , of the royal netherlands meteorological institute , who is omi 's principal investigator .
" this will help us understand how pollution is formed and where it comes from , its sources ; and where it goes to , its sinks .
" all this helps us understand the chemistry involved and that is important for us if we want to check our models . "
long track dr levelt was speaking at the american geophysical union -lrb- agu -rrb- fall meeting .
her team was presenting maps it is developing to track nitrogen dioxide -lrb- no2 -rrb- .
the gas - which comes from motor vehicle exhausts , power plants and industry - is an important precursor in the production of ground-level ozone , part of the photochemical smog that can blight city air , particularly in summer .
aura keeps a watch over the earth 's atmosphere by following the development and spread of no2 , omi can be used to help make forecasts of where problem air might develop .
long-term tracking of the gas can also identify emission hotspots .
one map presented at the agu , pulling together data gathered from may to september this year , showed expected high emissions over some of europe 's cities , and in particular over antwerp , rotterdam and the ruhr .
omi , which is a dutch-finnish instrument , can also detect formaldehyde , sulphur dioxide , small particles , as well as tropospheric ozone .
the dutch are in the pilot stage of their mapping project but expect eventually to start providing invaluable data for all parts of the world .
ice uncertainty omi is just one of four instruments on aura that is giving researchers an extraordinary picture of the lower atmosphere .
the agu meeting was told the spacecraft 's microwave limb sounder -lrb- mls -rrb- instrument had recently begun offering the first observations of ice in clouds on a global basis .
this information is critical to our understanding of climate change .
clouds are one of the big uncertainties in atmospheric modelling .
some types of cloud will reflect solar radiation and help cool the planet , others will trap radiation and warm the earth 's surface .
" there is a very wide disagreement in the models about how to represent cloud ice and that limits our confidence in the climate change predictions they provide , " said duane waliser , a principal scientist at the us space agency 's jet propulsion laboratory .
" it 's very important this is rectified . "

brian martin , chief justice of australia 's northern territory , said the evidence was very distressing , but jurors must assess it objectively .
he spoke after mr falconio 's mother fled the courtroom in distress .
bradley murdoch , 47 , denies murdering british tourist mr falconio in 2001 , and attacking and kidnapping his girlfriend joanne lees .
the jury has listened to two months of evidence in the darwin court .
emotional influence mr justice martin was forced to pause momentarily as the victim 's mother , joan falconio , of holmfirth , huddersfield , stood up from her public gallery seat and left the court . "
you may have noticed the family , particularly mrs falconio , leaving the court from time to time " mr justice martin details of judge 's remarks he had been talking about the lack of a trail of blood and human tissue at the scene of the alleged murder on a remote stretch of highway near barrow creek , 200 miles north of alice springs .
after a brief pause , he continued : " you may have noticed the family , particularly mrs falconio , leaving the court from time to time .
" you might not think that 's very surprising , the evidence is very distressing .
" but you must put aside any emotion that you see in other people , or that you may feel , and take these questions purely objectively and dispassionately , and without being influenced by these emotions . "
the court has heard ms lees , 32 , of brighton , describe how the vehicle she and mr falconio , 28 , of huddersfield , were travelling in was flagged down by another motorist .
' torchlight search ' she said mr falconio went to speak to the defendant and never re-emerged .
she was then threatened with a gun and held hostage in a van while , the prosecution says , he disposed of mr falconio 's body .
she later managed to escape from under the vehicle 's loose canopy and then hid in the undergrowth in the dark while her attacker searched for her with a torch , she claims .
eventually he gave up and left , the court heard .
mr falconio 's body has never been found .
in beginning his summing up , the judge said the jury must decide whether to accept miss lees ' evidence beyond reasonable doubt and whether they were satisfied that , in the absence of a body , mr falconio was shot and murdered . "
if you accept miss lees ' evidence that the accused pulled mr falconio and miss lees over , the crown will have proved that mr falconio was killed " mr justice martin " obviously if you have any doubt about that there ca n't be any question the accused must be acquitted , " he said .
" if you accept miss lees ' evidence that the accused pulled mr falconio and miss lees over , the crown will have proved that mr falconio was killed . "
he also instructed the jury to consider a number of other key issues .
he asked them to consider the reliability of some of the evidence .
this included reference to a claim from two witnesses that they had seen mr falconio eight days after the alleged murder .
the judge also said that mr murdoch 's former business partner james hepi , who gave evidence against the accused , was a cannabis dealer and was " not a good character " .
and , referring to miss lees ' identification of mr murdoch as her attacker , he said that , although " high emotion " could cause confusion , " traumatic events can also stimulate the mind and cause events to remain vivid long after the incident in question " .
the case was adjourned until monday when the summing up will continue .

the figure is close to one-third below previous government projections .
baa hopes the runway , which is strongly opposed by local residents and environmental groups , will boost the uk economy and be ready by 2013 .
separately , baa said 10.4 million passengers passed through its airports in november , up 2.2 % on a year ago .
baa operates airports at heathrow , gatwick and stansted in london , and southampton , edinburgh , glasgow and aberdeen .
mike clasper , baa chief executive , said : " ' we 've worked very hard in the last two years to ensure that stansted g2 -lsb- runway two -rsb- will deliver great value to the uk economy , to our airlines and to people using the airport .
" we 've also examined in great detail the environmental impacts of the project , in order to ensure that they are reduced as far as possible . "
environmental worries the plans for stansted - which would more than double the airport 's yearly passenger capacity to 50 million - are opposed by some airlines , which fear higher airport charges .
ryanair and easyjet , which account for about 90 % of stansted 's business , are worried they will effectively have to fund the expansion .
new british airways boss willie walsh has also questioned the need for a new runway at stansted , and promised to fight any resultant increase in airport charges to pay for it .
and the stop stansted expansion group said the baa proposal would cause catastrophic damage to the environment .
campaign director carol barbone said : " a second runway in any position would be an environmental catastrophe for which there is absolutely no economic justification . "

members of the rmt union were gathering at newcastle 's central station after announced reductions in services between the city and sunderland .
train operator northern rail is reducing the number of trains between the cities from five to one an hour .
it says the reduction is at the request of metro operator nexus , which itself will operate five trains an hour .
the union says it has the support of mps in the region and passenger groups .
union general secretary bob crow said : " buses and trams should complement rail services , not replace them . "
the stretch of track between newcastle and sunderland is shared between northern rail and tyne and wear metro operator nexus .
a spokesman for northern rail said the reduction was at the behest of nexus , which administers funds on behalf of the tyne and wear passenger transport authority .
in a statement nexus said : " this review has allowed for a more frequent service between the two cities . "
it added the estimated £ 4m saving would be spent upgrading sunderland station .

the pilots began their walkout on thursday , demanding higher pay .
their union and the firm , south korea 's largest airline , met briefly on friday but no breakthroughs were reported .
with about 60 % of the airline 's flights cancelled , the government has said it is prepared to use emergency powers to force the pilots back to work .
finance minister han duck-soo said : " it is regretful that the korean air pilots ' strike is causing damage to the economy and inconvenience for people . "
" the government should prepare all possible measures , including the power to stop the strike and bring in emergency mediation , because the intangible losses are increasing , " he told an economic co-ordination meeting .
demands rejected the korean authorities broke up a strike by pilots at asiana airlines this summer after it entered its 25th day .
emergency powers enable the government to intervene in strikes affecting industries which are critical to the national economy .
korean air carries about half of the country 's air cargo , including major exports such as semiconductors and mobile phones .
a ruling party official said december was the busiest month for exports .
about 500 pilots held a rally near seoul on thursday and more are expected to join the strike in coming days .
korean air says the strike is costing it about 25 billion won -lrb- $ 24m -rrb- a day .
the carrier expects increased disruption on friday unions representing about two-thirds of the airline 's pilots are pushing for an 8 % rise in annual pay .
the carrier has rejected this demand , offering a 3 % rise instead .
it said the workers ' demands were unrealistic , given rising fuel costs and fierce competition in the airline sector .
only this summer strike action was narrowly avoided after korean air reached agreement with unions on minimum rest times for pilots after international flights .
before the asiana strike , the emergency powers had only been used twice - in 1969 and 1993 .
they enable the government to order a return to work and negotiations .
if no settlement is reached the government can dictate one .
" we will first try to lead them to reach an agreement voluntarily and keep a close eye on further developments , " said labour ministry spokesman jung hyun-ok .

fourth-quarter revenue will now be between $ 10.4bn -lrb- £ 5.9bn -rrb- and $ 10.6bn.
analysts had expected sales of nearly $ 10.6bn , and the firm had earlier said they could rise as high as $ 10.8bn.
intel 's shares fell on the news as many investors had hoped the chipmaker would follow rival texas instruments , which raised its earnings outlook this week .
intel shares lost 3 % in electronic after-hours trading in new york .
" it 's going to be viewed as moderately disappointing , " said cody acree , an analyst at stifel , nicolaus & co .
" optimism had definitely become more prevalent with general semiconductor demand overall . "
price slice the company also tweaked its forecasts for gross profit margins , prompting analysts to question whether or not they had peaked .
" there 's a lot of cynicism about their growth prospects , " said roger kay of research firm endpoint technology associates .
" it 's a really big boat and ca n't turn very quickly . "
intel has been hampered by supply problems , though chief financial officer andy bryant has said the company was in the process of sorting that issue out .
the company said its business was still strong , with growth driven by demand for laptop computers and rising sales in emerging markets .

but now it is facing a triple crisis : sharply reduced demand for its labour , as the mines become exhausted ; a rising tide of hiv and aids , and declining agriculture as erosion and drought reduces its crop yields .
standing in the village of hakonyane , just an hour 's drive south of the capital , maseru , one can see the green fields of south africa , about one kilometre away .
it looks lush , and the cattle are well fed .
but in this village , the fields are green with the new shoots of grass brought by the rains , but no ploughing is under way .
i found thabisi hashatsi staring out over his fields .
oxen should be now yoked together , straining their backs to break the soil , but the fields are lying idle .
" i have no money for cattle , " said mr hashatsi .
" it is six years since i got a proper harvest . "
walking through the fields it is clear the village is in crisis .
hakonyane , like so many villages across this country seems in almost terminal decline .
crisis aids is decimating its young people , leaving few able bodied adults to farm the fields .
soil erosion cut deep furrows into the hillsides , taking lesotho 's precious topsoil to south africa .
drought has also played a part in this part of the country , although other areas did receive adequate rainfall .
the impact on crop production is clear .
according to the un 's world food programme , in 1980 lesotho produced 80 % of its cereal needs .
by the 1990 's cereal production had fallen to 50 % of the country 's requirement .
by 2004 that figure stood at just 30 % .
the wfp describes the situation as one of " steady decline " .
cash the loss of jobs on the mines has meant little cash coming into the area from remittances .
mampo musi is one of the few villagers lucky enough to still have a husband working on a south african mine .
it is estimated just seven out of 400 households in the village can rely on income from the mines .
she is not happy about her husband being away from home , but the cash is very welcome .
now she has to help her neighbours , many of whom earn next to nothing .
" they ask me , can you please give me a little maize .
it makes me feel nervous .
" if i see someone who does not eat , i feel sorry for them . "
jobs on the surface , life in the capital , maseru , is very different .
it 's a bustling town , but even here the situation is grim .
a string of textile firms closed in the last year .
ten thousand jobs have been lost since january .
many who came from the rural areas in search of work , are now unemployed .
constance shedile is one of those who lost her job .
" we were told to go home at times , and then told to come back .
" sometimes we were not paid because the factory had no money .
it went on like that until the factory closed .
it was bad , because i did not know how i was going to live . "
falling income levels , declining food production and increasing hiv / aids are having an unmistakeable impact on basotho society .
collapse funerals , which used to be held only on saturday are now taking place on most days of the week .
the life expectancy of the country is dropping dramatically .
the united nations is currently feeding about a quarter of million out of lesotho 's two million people .
but this is n't a temporary phenomenon .
the wfp 's mads lofvall believes the situation is so severe that the social structure is close to collapse .
" you can easily find segments of the population starting to give up , because the problems are just growing bigger every day .
and when that happens people just live from day to day , because you do not see any future . "
despair back at the village of hakonyane , mr hashatsi gazes out across his empty , fallow fields .
he 's close to despair about the future .
" i do n't think there will be any change .
i do n't think there will be any change in my life , " he says .
once villages like this would have been poor , but more or less self sufficient .
the fields would have produced enough maize , beans and sorghum to feed its people .
but this is no longer the case .
now an air of despair hangs over every hut and hope has all but disappeared .

but now it is facing a triple crisis : sharply reduced demand for its labour , as the mines become exhausted ; a rising tide of hiv and aids , and declining agriculture as erosion and drought reduces its crop yields .
standing in the village of hakonyane , just an hour 's drive south of the capital , maseru , one can see the green fields of south africa , about one kilometre away .
it looks lush , and the cattle are well fed .
but in this village , the fields are green with the new shoots of grass brought by the rains , but no ploughing is under way .
i found thabisi hashatsi staring out over his fields .
oxen should be now yoked together , straining their backs to break the soil , but the fields are lying idle .
" i have no money for cattle , " said mr hashatsi .
" it is six years since i got a proper harvest . "
walking through the fields it is clear the village is in crisis .
hakonyane , like so many villages across this country seems in almost terminal decline .
crisis aids is decimating its young people , leaving few able bodied adults to farm the fields .
soil erosion cut deep furrows into the hillsides , taking lesotho 's precious topsoil to south africa .
soil erosion is affecting places like hakonyane badly drought has also played a part in this part of the country , although other areas did receive adequate rainfall .
the impact on crop production is clear .
according to the un 's world food programme , in 1980 lesotho produced 80 % of its cereal needs .
by the 1990 's cereal production had fallen to 50 % of the country 's requirement .
by 2004 that figure stood at just 30 % .
the wfp describes the situation as one of " steady decline " .
cash the loss of jobs on the mines has meant little cash coming into the area from remittances .
mampo musi is one of the few villagers lucky enough to still have a husband working on a south african mine .
it is estimated just seven out of 400 households in the village can rely on income from the mines .
she is not happy about her husband being away from home , but the cash is very welcome .
now she has to help her neighbours , many of whom earn next to nothing .
" they ask me , can you please give me a little maize .
it makes me feel nervous .
" if i see someone who does not eat , i feel sorry for them . "
jobs on the surface , life in the capital , maseru , is very different .
it 's a bustling town , but even here the situation is grim .
a string of textile firms closed in the last year .
a string of textile factories have closed this year ten thousand jobs have been lost since january .
many who came from the rural areas in search of work , are now unemployed .
constance shedile is one of those who lost her job .
" we were told to go home at times , and then told to come back .
" sometimes we were not paid because the factory had no money .
it went on like that until the factory closed .
it was bad , because i did not know how i was going to live . "
falling income levels , declining food production and increasing hiv / aids are having an unmistakeable impact on basotho society .
collapse funerals , which used to be held only on saturday are now taking place on most days of the week .
the life expectancy of the country is dropping dramatically .
life expectancy has dropped dramatically in the past 20 years the united nations is currently feeding about a quarter of million out of lesotho 's two million people .
but this is n't a temporary phenomenon .
the wfp 's mads lofvall believes the situation is so severe that the social structure is close to collapse .
" you can easily find segments of the population starting to give up , because the problems are just growing bigger every day .
and when that happens people just live from day to day , because you do not see any future . "
despair back at the village of hakonyane , mr hashatsi gazes out across his empty , fallow fields .
the odds are stacked against lesotho 's rural children he 's close to despair about the future .
" i do n't think there will be any change .
i do n't think there will be any change in my life , " he says .
once villages like this would have been poor , but more or less self sufficient .
the fields would have produced enough maize , beans and sorghum to feed its people .
but this is no longer the case .
now an air of despair hangs over every hut and hope has all but disappeared .
