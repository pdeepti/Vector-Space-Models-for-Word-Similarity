“ we take a very dim view of the connection between social origin and achievement at school .
it is something that must be addressed , ” she said in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . claudia roth , leader of the green party , called the latest pisa study another “ slap in the face " for the german education system while outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering admitted : “ the state of education in germany is not good . ” poor migrant children particulary affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children from poor families face an uphill struggle for a good education .
while german politicians bemoan the state of affairs , the country 's president horst köhler this week assessed the situation first hand by paying a visit to a school in cologne . one the most damaging conclusions of the latest study is that children from migrant backgrounds are particularly likely to underperform and also fail to integrate properly in society if their parents come from a lower social class and fail to support them adequately . " it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .
around one third of the areas inhabitants are foreigners , half of which are turkish .
only about half of the 270 children who attend the school have german parents . mixed culture school addressing the problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixed culture schools have the added problem of the language barrier .
principal ursula stumpf believes that integration helps the children settle at school and feel comfortable to learn regardless of their economic background .
she has found that a good grasp of the german language is the first step to making children of migrants feel better about themselves and make them ready to learn . " in many families the mother tongue is spoken .
this is okay .
however , the medium of instruction at school is german .
and if the children do not understand what the teacher or their class-mates say , i can imagine that they can get angry because they really want to understand everything . " sponsored language courses bridging the divide the language barrier is something the school is hoping to breach through with extra-curricular language classes .
many parents themselves have a basic grasp of german or little education themselves and therefore can not help their children at home .
and as many come from deprived backgrounds , the school is offering the classes for free after securing financial support from sponsors such as mercator , the european network for regional or minority languages and education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the cologne school are enthusiastic language learners .
" the children want to be integrated into normal school life , ” said language teacher lina wienold .
“ this is because they want to speak like the german children and so the motivation is high . ” mercator chairperson annabel von klenck said : " this project is a big success .
nobody has talked about federalism , nobody has talked about policy .
nobody has talked a lot about money .
enough sponsors have been found .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.11.2005 rioting unlikely in germany , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany so far has not witnessed the kind of violence raging in france france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .
could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos . " i do n't see any parallel societies developing there , " bade said .
" these are relatively mixed areas . " better integration needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , it 's mainly germans who riot but he added that germans had to realize that they would have to shoulder major costs in the long run if they do not improve existing integration programs . bade said germany should set up a three-tier system of intergration : helping those willing to come to germany learn the language before they arrive , supporting them once they 've immigrated and looking after those who have failed to get on their feet once they 're in the country . " that costs a lot of money , but if we do n't do it , we 'll pay for it dearly in the long run , " he said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting in paris continues a week of suburban violence in france showed no sign of abating friday after an eighth night of clashes and car-burning which for the first time spread beyond the capital .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .

annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .

experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos . " i do n't see any parallel societies developing there , " bade said .
" these are relatively mixed areas . " better integration needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , it 's mainly germans who riot but he added that germans had to realize that they would have to shoulder major costs in the long run if they do not improve existing integration programs . bade said germany should set up a three-tier system of intergration : helping those willing to come to germany learn the language before they arrive , supporting them once they 've immigrated and looking after those who have failed to get on their feet once they 're in the country . " that costs a lot of money , but if we do n't do it , we 'll pay for it dearly in the long run , " he said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting in paris continues a week of suburban violence in france showed no sign of abating friday after an eighth night of clashes and car-burning which for the first time spread beyond the capital .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.11.2005 rioting unlikely in germany , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany so far has not witnessed the kind of violence raging in france france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .
could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos . " i do n't see any parallel societies developing there , " bade said .
" these are relatively mixed areas . " better integration needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , it 's mainly germans who riot but he added that germans had to realize that they would have to shoulder major costs in the long run if they do not improve existing integration programs . bade said germany should set up a three-tier system of intergration : helping those willing to come to germany learn the language before they arrive , supporting them once they 've immigrated and looking after those who have failed to get on their feet once they 're in the country . " that costs a lot of money , but if we do n't do it , we 'll pay for it dearly in the long run , " he said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting in paris continues a week of suburban violence in france showed no sign of abating friday after an eighth night of clashes and car-burning which for the first time spread beyond the capital .

" i already see a couple of names i know , " she said as she started typing .
" i 've chatted with ' tante anna ' before so i 'd better say hi . "
for knauf , germany.ru allows her to feel a little closer to home every evening , since it enables her to chat with other russians in germany , catch up on news back in russia , or exchange experiences about their new lives in a country that is still very foreign for many of them .
" it 's simply a place where i can meet like-minded people who speak my language and who i do n't have to explain myself to , " she said .
" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .

turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .

" it 's a large aircraft so one could imagine a large group of detainees flying on this plane , as against some other smaller executive jets that they used , " he told afp .
" the fact that it stops in eastern europe , then morocco and then guantanamo suggests different classes of prisoners being deposited in different places . " in brussels , a spokesman for hrw 's belgian branch , jean-paul marthoz , said " inquiries up until now seem to indicate that poland and romania are the countries that received prisoners held by the cia . " he refused to rule out the cia could be holding " ghost prisoners " elsewhere in eastern europe . eu satisfied the european commission has no specific suspicions that the us central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- is running secret prisons in eastern europe , a spokesman said on friday .
" at this time we do not have any specific suspicion , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs at the eu 's executive arm . he said the commission was also satisfied with official denials from romania and poland that such facilities existed on their territories . " i think the statements by the romanian and polish authorities are crystal clear , " roscam abbing said .
" all of those official declarations deny the existence of such possible prisons .
we do not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time .
having said that , we will continue to monitor the situation . " the eu commission had said thursday it would review whether the cia operates secret prisons in eastern europe , noting that such facilities would not comply with eu treaties . icrc " increasingly concerned " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't admit or deny the cia prisons the international committee of the red cross said friday that it had so far failed to reach an agreement with the us about access to terror suspects held abroad secretly , despite some two years of talks . following newspaper reports this week about secret cia prisons for terror suspects abroad , spokeswoman antonella notari said the icrc had been pressing washington on the issue since at least january 2004 . " the icrc , for some time already , has repeatedly raised the issue of receiving notification and subsequently access to persons held in undisclosed places of detention , in the context of the so called ' war on terror , ' she said .
" we have not reached an agreement with the us authorities so far - our confidential dialogue with them continues . " the icrc currently conducts confidential visits to detainees held at the us military base at guantanamo bay and in afghanistan and iraq .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos . " i do n't see any parallel societies developing there , " bade said .
" these are relatively mixed areas .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .
vw said its position in the us market had " stabilized " towards the end of the third quarter , thanks to the launch of the new jetta and passat models , as well as audi a4 and audi a6 . " we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter .
however , due to the difficult market situation there , we will not match the previous year 's delivery levels , " the car maker said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.11.2005 " ethnoportals " link minority communities in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying connected to home is important for immigrants while newspapers and even tv channels aimed at foreigners in german are common these days , minority communities are finding more interactive ways to communicate with one another - through web portals . every evening after work , maria knauf sits down at her computer and types in her password for the web site www.germany.ru.
on the site she 's " kiska , " which means something close to " kitten , " and once she 's logged on , she checks out who 's online .
" i already see a couple of names i know , " she said as she started typing .
" i 've chatted with ' tante anna ' before so i 'd better say hi . "
for knauf , germany.ru allows her to feel a little closer to home every evening , since it enables her to chat with other russians in germany , catch up on news back in russia , or exchange experiences about their new lives in a country that is still very foreign for many of them .
" it 's simply a place where i can meet like-minded people who speak my language and who i do n't have to explain myself to , " she said .
" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .
the site has 300,000 registered members and some 30,000 visit the pages every day , making it the most-visited site for russian users in western europe .
most of the surfers who stop by are young people who have immigrated to germany .
" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .
but in germany , it was a virtual desert .
" we thought there should be something for us since there are so many turks living in germany , " said tamir kulmac , one of the brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.vaybee.de they set up vaybee ! , which means " wow ! " or " great ! " in turkish .
today , vaybee.de is the most successful turkish portal in germany , with some 400,000 members .
" it 's supposed to be a community , with discussion forums , chat functions , e-mail , that kind of thing , " said kulmac .
" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .
the webmasters know that in the fast-moving world of the internet , change is the only constant , and they frequently update their sites and add new features .
they have to , since they 're not the only kids on the block anymore - thousands of imitators of all ethnic stripes have put their own portals on line now .
home-grown crowd as well the portals do n't only appeal to brand-new arrivals to germany .
many of the users on vaybee ! are german-turks who were born or grew up in germany , and speak the language like natives .
in a recent survey , the site found out that some 40 percent of its users are women , a fact which kulmac did n't expect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some women , ethnoportals are an idea forum for meeting new people he says , however , after thinking about it , he realized that the forum was ideal for turkish women , who , because of a more conservative culture , can be less willing to pursue traditional ways of getting out and getting to know people .
" people can meet , flirt , or date on our site , but all in a secure and , if you want , anonymous environment , " he said . nadja baeva -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virtual battle between serbs and croats hackers in the former yugoslavia have been going at it .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .
vw said its position in the us market had " stabilized " towards the end of the third quarter , thanks to the launch of the new jetta and passat models , as well as audi a4 and audi a6 . " we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter .
however , due to the difficult market situation there , we will not match the previous year 's delivery levels , " the car maker said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.11.2005 mixed signals from vw as job cuts offset profits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's quarterly results suggest a recovery but ominous job cuts loom german auto giant volkswagen sent out mixed signals thursday as vw reported substantial profits , suggesting the company was in good shape , while announcing it could slash 14,000 jobs in europe , 10,000 alone in germany . bottom-line earnings at vw , europe 's biggest car maker , surged in the third quarter on 2005 on the back of rising sales and the positive effects of a massive cost-cutting program .
the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .
vw said its position in the us market had " stabilized " towards the end of the third quarter , thanks to the launch of the new jetta and passat models , as well as audi a4 and audi a6 . " we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter .
however , due to the difficult market situation there , we will not match the previous year 's delivery levels , " the car maker said .

it 's a welcome piece of good news for the country 's strained public finances . the ministry said it was set to receive 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- more than originally expected in tax revenues in 2005 and 2006 combined , but it warned that germany 's public finances would nevertheless remain " extremely tight . " the federal , regional and municipal authorities were set to receive 447.9 billion euros in tax revenues this year , 2.9 billion euros more than previously budgeted , the finance ministry said in a statement . the increase was attributable to lower federal transfers to the eu , and increased trade tax at a municipal level . next year good , too next year , tax revenues would amount to 457.4 billion euros , 0.9 billion euros more than previously budgeted , again due to positive developments in trade tax , which is a sort of income tax for companies , the ministry estimated . " it is the first time in a long time that tax revenue forecasts have been revised upwards , " the ministry said .
" at the same time , it must be stated that the financial situation of all public budgets remains extremely tight , " it added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry calculates higher trade taxes are one cause of the surplus the federal budget alone would actually see a slight fall in revenues next year as a result of the still low rate of economic growth in germany , the ministry said .
in addition , gasoline tax revenues were set to decline as runaway oil prices weighed on consumption . berlin recently cut its forecast for growth next year to 1.2 percent from 1.6 percent , blaming high oil prices which it said would put the brakes on growth . getting germany 's public finances back in order is one of the pressing tasks facing the incoming government coalition of social democrat spd and conservative cdu / csu parties . the incoming government under chancellor-to-be angela merkel has calculated that 35 billion euros should be cut from the budget in 2007 , which would translate into 425 euros in belt-tightening per person , or 1,350 euros for everyone in a job and paying social security . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive national budget cuts likely in germany a new round of talks on forming a grand coalition government in germany ended with a call for germans to tighten their belts as tens of billions of euros must be saved in the national budget over the coming years .

on the site she 's " kiska , " which means something close to " kitten , " and once she 's logged on , she checks out who 's online .
" i already see a couple of names i know , " she said as she started typing .
" i 've chatted with ' tante anna ' before so i 'd better say hi . "
for knauf , germany.ru allows her to feel a little closer to home every evening , since it enables her to chat with other russians in germany , catch up on news back in russia , or exchange experiences about their new lives in a country that is still very foreign for many of them .
" it 's simply a place where i can meet like-minded people who speak my language and who i do n't have to explain myself to , " she said .
" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .
the site has 300,000 registered members and some 30,000 visit the pages every day , making it the most-visited site for russian users in western europe .
most of the surfers who stop by are young people who have immigrated to germany .
" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .
but in germany , it was a virtual desert .
" we thought there should be something for us since there are so many turks living in germany , " said tamir kulmac , one of the brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.vaybee.de they set up vaybee ! , which means " wow ! " or " great ! " in turkish .
today , vaybee.de is the most successful turkish portal in germany , with some 400,000 members .
" it 's supposed to be a community , with discussion forums , chat functions , e-mail , that kind of thing , " said kulmac .
" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .
the webmasters know that in the fast-moving world of the internet , change is the only constant , and they frequently update their sites and add new features .
they have to , since they 're not the only kids on the block anymore - thousands of imitators of all ethnic stripes have put their own portals on line now .
home-grown crowd as well the portals do n't only appeal to brand-new arrivals to germany .
many of the users on vaybee ! are german-turks who were born or grew up in germany , and speak the language like natives .
in a recent survey , the site found out that some 40 percent of its users are women , a fact which kulmac did n't expect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some women , ethnoportals are an idea forum for meeting new people he says , however , after thinking about it , he realized that the forum was ideal for turkish women , who , because of a more conservative culture , can be less willing to pursue traditional ways of getting out and getting to know people .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .

" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .

the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .
vw said its position in the us market had " stabilized " towards the end of the third quarter , thanks to the launch of the new jetta and passat models , as well as audi a4 and audi a6 . " we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter .
however , due to the difficult market situation there , we will not match the previous year 's delivery levels , " the car maker said .
in western europe , vw expected to increase its market share , particularly in germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen unable to sell europcar so far with a need to get itself back into shape , europe 's largest car manufacturer is selling off its restructuring operations and subsidiaries .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

" i think the statements by the romanian and polish authorities are crystal clear , " roscam abbing said .
" all of those official declarations deny the existence of such possible prisons .
we do not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time .

" the icrc , for some time already , has repeatedly raised the issue of receiving notification and subsequently access to persons held in undisclosed places of detention , in the context of the so called ' war on terror , ' she said .
" we have not reached an agreement with the us authorities so far - our confidential dialogue with them continues . " the icrc currently conducts confidential visits to detainees held at the us military base at guantanamo bay and in afghanistan and iraq .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.11.2005 rioting unlikely in germany , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany so far has not witnessed the kind of violence raging in france france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .
could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos . " i do n't see any parallel societies developing there , " bade said .
" these are relatively mixed areas . " better integration needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , it 's mainly germans who riot but he added that germans had to realize that they would have to shoulder major costs in the long run if they do not improve existing integration programs . bade said germany should set up a three-tier system of intergration : helping those willing to come to germany learn the language before they arrive , supporting them once they 've immigrated and looking after those who have failed to get on their feet once they 're in the country . " that costs a lot of money , but if we do n't do it , we 'll pay for it dearly in the long run , " he said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting in paris continues a week of suburban violence in france showed no sign of abating friday after an eighth night of clashes and car-burning which for the first time spread beyond the capital .

could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany .

" we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos .

could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.11.2005 rioting unlikely in germany , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany so far has not witnessed the kind of violence raging in france france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .
could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .

" we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos .

" these are relatively mixed areas . " better integration needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , it 's mainly germans who riot but he added that germans had to realize that they would have to shoulder major costs in the long run if they do not improve existing integration programs . bade said germany should set up a three-tier system of intergration : helping those willing to come to germany learn the language before they arrive , supporting them once they 've immigrated and looking after those who have failed to get on their feet once they 're in the country .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

“ we take a very dim view of the connection between social origin and achievement at school .
it is something that must be addressed , ” she said in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . claudia roth , leader of the green party , called the latest pisa study another “ slap in the face " for the german education system while outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering admitted : “ the state of education in germany is not good . ” poor migrant children particulary affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children from poor families face an uphill struggle for a good education .
while german politicians bemoan the state of affairs , the country 's president horst köhler this week assessed the situation first hand by paying a visit to a school in cologne . one the most damaging conclusions of the latest study is that children from migrant backgrounds are particularly likely to underperform and also fail to integrate properly in society if their parents come from a lower social class and fail to support them adequately . " it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .
around one third of the areas inhabitants are foreigners , half of which are turkish .
only about half of the 270 children who attend the school have german parents . mixed culture school addressing the problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixed culture schools have the added problem of the language barrier .
principal ursula stumpf believes that integration helps the children settle at school and feel comfortable to learn regardless of their economic background .
she has found that a good grasp of the german language is the first step to making children of migrants feel better about themselves and make them ready to learn . " in many families the mother tongue is spoken .
this is okay .
however , the medium of instruction at school is german .
and if the children do not understand what the teacher or their class-mates say , i can imagine that they can get angry because they really want to understand everything . " sponsored language courses bridging the divide the language barrier is something the school is hoping to breach through with extra-curricular language classes .
many parents themselves have a basic grasp of german or little education themselves and therefore can not help their children at home .
and as many come from deprived backgrounds , the school is offering the classes for free after securing financial support from sponsors such as mercator , the european network for regional or minority languages and education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the cologne school are enthusiastic language learners .
" the children want to be integrated into normal school life , ” said language teacher lina wienold .
“ this is because they want to speak like the german children and so the motivation is high . ” mercator chairperson annabel von klenck said : " this project is a big success .
nobody has talked about federalism , nobody has talked about policy .
nobody has talked a lot about money .
enough sponsors have been found .

it 's a welcome piece of good news for the country 's strained public finances . the ministry said it was set to receive 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- more than originally expected in tax revenues in 2005 and 2006 combined , but it warned that germany 's public finances would nevertheless remain " extremely tight . " the federal , regional and municipal authorities were set to receive 447.9 billion euros in tax revenues this year , 2.9 billion euros more than previously budgeted , the finance ministry said in a statement . the increase was attributable to lower federal transfers to the eu , and increased trade tax at a municipal level . next year good , too next year , tax revenues would amount to 457.4 billion euros , 0.9 billion euros more than previously budgeted , again due to positive developments in trade tax , which is a sort of income tax for companies , the ministry estimated . " it is the first time in a long time that tax revenue forecasts have been revised upwards , " the ministry said .
" at the same time , it must be stated that the financial situation of all public budgets remains extremely tight , " it added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry calculates higher trade taxes are one cause of the surplus the federal budget alone would actually see a slight fall in revenues next year as a result of the still low rate of economic growth in germany , the ministry said .
in addition , gasoline tax revenues were set to decline as runaway oil prices weighed on consumption . berlin recently cut its forecast for growth next year to 1.2 percent from 1.6 percent , blaming high oil prices which it said would put the brakes on growth . getting germany 's public finances back in order is one of the pressing tasks facing the incoming government coalition of social democrat spd and conservative cdu / csu parties . the incoming government under chancellor-to-be angela merkel has calculated that 35 billion euros should be cut from the budget in 2007 , which would translate into 425 euros in belt-tightening per person , or 1,350 euros for everyone in a job and paying social security . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive national budget cuts likely in germany a new round of talks on forming a grand coalition government in germany ended with a call for germans to tighten their belts as tens of billions of euros must be saved in the national budget over the coming years .

on the site she 's " kiska , " which means something close to " kitten , " and once she 's logged on , she checks out who 's online .
" i already see a couple of names i know , " she said as she started typing .
" i 've chatted with ' tante anna ' before so i 'd better say hi . "
for knauf , germany.ru allows her to feel a little closer to home every evening , since it enables her to chat with other russians in germany , catch up on news back in russia , or exchange experiences about their new lives in a country that is still very foreign for many of them .
" it 's simply a place where i can meet like-minded people who speak my language and who i do n't have to explain myself to , " she said .
" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .
the site has 300,000 registered members and some 30,000 visit the pages every day , making it the most-visited site for russian users in western europe .
most of the surfers who stop by are young people who have immigrated to germany .
" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .
but in germany , it was a virtual desert .
" we thought there should be something for us since there are so many turks living in germany , " said tamir kulmac , one of the brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.vaybee.de they set up vaybee ! , which means " wow ! " or " great ! " in turkish .
today , vaybee.de is the most successful turkish portal in germany , with some 400,000 members .
" it 's supposed to be a community , with discussion forums , chat functions , e-mail , that kind of thing , " said kulmac .
" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .
the webmasters know that in the fast-moving world of the internet , change is the only constant , and they frequently update their sites and add new features .
they have to , since they 're not the only kids on the block anymore - thousands of imitators of all ethnic stripes have put their own portals on line now .
home-grown crowd as well the portals do n't only appeal to brand-new arrivals to germany .
many of the users on vaybee ! are german-turks who were born or grew up in germany , and speak the language like natives .
in a recent survey , the site found out that some 40 percent of its users are women , a fact which kulmac did n't expect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some women , ethnoportals are an idea forum for meeting new people he says , however , after thinking about it , he realized that the forum was ideal for turkish women , who , because of a more conservative culture , can be less willing to pursue traditional ways of getting out and getting to know people .

nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .
vw said its position in the us market had " stabilized " towards the end of the third quarter , thanks to the launch of the new jetta and passat models , as well as audi a4 and audi a6 . " we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter .
however , due to the difficult market situation there , we will not match the previous year 's delivery levels , " the car maker said .
in western europe , vw expected to increase its market share , particularly in germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen unable to sell europcar so far with a need to get itself back into shape , europe 's largest car manufacturer is selling off its restructuring operations and subsidiaries .

could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos . " i do n't see any parallel societies developing there , " bade said .
" these are relatively mixed areas . " better integration needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , it 's mainly germans who riot but he added that germans had to realize that they would have to shoulder major costs in the long run if they do not improve existing integration programs . bade said germany should set up a three-tier system of intergration : helping those willing to come to germany learn the language before they arrive , supporting them once they 've immigrated and looking after those who have failed to get on their feet once they 're in the country . " that costs a lot of money , but if we do n't do it , we 'll pay for it dearly in the long run , " he said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting in paris continues a week of suburban violence in france showed no sign of abating friday after an eighth night of clashes and car-burning which for the first time spread beyond the capital .

could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos . " i do n't see any parallel societies developing there , " bade said .
" these are relatively mixed areas . " better integration needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , it 's mainly germans who riot but he added that germans had to realize that they would have to shoulder major costs in the long run if they do not improve existing integration programs . bade said germany should set up a three-tier system of intergration : helping those willing to come to germany learn the language before they arrive , supporting them once they 've immigrated and looking after those who have failed to get on their feet once they 're in the country .

on the site she 's " kiska , " which means something close to " kitten , " and once she 's logged on , she checks out who 's online .
" i already see a couple of names i know , " she said as she started typing .
" i 've chatted with ' tante anna ' before so i 'd better say hi . "
for knauf , germany.ru allows her to feel a little closer to home every evening , since it enables her to chat with other russians in germany , catch up on news back in russia , or exchange experiences about their new lives in a country that is still very foreign for many of them .
" it 's simply a place where i can meet like-minded people who speak my language and who i do n't have to explain myself to , " she said .
" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .
the site has 300,000 registered members and some 30,000 visit the pages every day , making it the most-visited site for russian users in western europe .
most of the surfers who stop by are young people who have immigrated to germany .
" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .
but in germany , it was a virtual desert .
" we thought there should be something for us since there are so many turks living in germany , " said tamir kulmac , one of the brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.vaybee.de they set up vaybee ! , which means " wow ! " or " great ! " in turkish .
today , vaybee.de is the most successful turkish portal in germany , with some 400,000 members .
" it 's supposed to be a community , with discussion forums , chat functions , e-mail , that kind of thing , " said kulmac .
" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .
the webmasters know that in the fast-moving world of the internet , change is the only constant , and they frequently update their sites and add new features .
they have to , since they 're not the only kids on the block anymore - thousands of imitators of all ethnic stripes have put their own portals on line now .
home-grown crowd as well the portals do n't only appeal to brand-new arrivals to germany .
many of the users on vaybee ! are german-turks who were born or grew up in germany , and speak the language like natives .
in a recent survey , the site found out that some 40 percent of its users are women , a fact which kulmac did n't expect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some women , ethnoportals are an idea forum for meeting new people he says , however , after thinking about it , he realized that the forum was ideal for turkish women , who , because of a more conservative culture , can be less willing to pursue traditional ways of getting out and getting to know people .

“ we take a very dim view of the connection between social origin and achievement at school .
it is something that must be addressed , ” she said in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . claudia roth , leader of the green party , called the latest pisa study another “ slap in the face " for the german education system while outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering admitted : “ the state of education in germany is not good . ” poor migrant children particulary affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children from poor families face an uphill struggle for a good education .
while german politicians bemoan the state of affairs , the country 's president horst köhler this week assessed the situation first hand by paying a visit to a school in cologne . one the most damaging conclusions of the latest study is that children from migrant backgrounds are particularly likely to underperform and also fail to integrate properly in society if their parents come from a lower social class and fail to support them adequately . " it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .
around one third of the areas inhabitants are foreigners , half of which are turkish .
only about half of the 270 children who attend the school have german parents . mixed culture school addressing the problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixed culture schools have the added problem of the language barrier .
principal ursula stumpf believes that integration helps the children settle at school and feel comfortable to learn regardless of their economic background .
she has found that a good grasp of the german language is the first step to making children of migrants feel better about themselves and make them ready to learn . " in many families the mother tongue is spoken .
this is okay .
however , the medium of instruction at school is german .
and if the children do not understand what the teacher or their class-mates say , i can imagine that they can get angry because they really want to understand everything . " sponsored language courses bridging the divide the language barrier is something the school is hoping to breach through with extra-curricular language classes .
many parents themselves have a basic grasp of german or little education themselves and therefore can not help their children at home .
and as many come from deprived backgrounds , the school is offering the classes for free after securing financial support from sponsors such as mercator , the european network for regional or minority languages and education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the cologne school are enthusiastic language learners .
" the children want to be integrated into normal school life , ” said language teacher lina wienold .
“ this is because they want to speak like the german children and so the motivation is high . ” mercator chairperson annabel von klenck said : " this project is a big success .
nobody has talked about federalism , nobody has talked about policy .
nobody has talked a lot about money .
enough sponsors have been found .

“ we take a very dim view of the connection between social origin and achievement at school .
it is something that must be addressed , ” she said in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . claudia roth , leader of the green party , called the latest pisa study another “ slap in the face " for the german education system while outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering admitted : “ the state of education in germany is not good . ” poor migrant children particulary affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children from poor families face an uphill struggle for a good education .
while german politicians bemoan the state of affairs , the country 's president horst köhler this week assessed the situation first hand by paying a visit to a school in cologne . one the most damaging conclusions of the latest study is that children from migrant backgrounds are particularly likely to underperform and also fail to integrate properly in society if their parents come from a lower social class and fail to support them adequately . " it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .
around one third of the areas inhabitants are foreigners , half of which are turkish .
only about half of the 270 children who attend the school have german parents . mixed culture school addressing the problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixed culture schools have the added problem of the language barrier .
principal ursula stumpf believes that integration helps the children settle at school and feel comfortable to learn regardless of their economic background .
she has found that a good grasp of the german language is the first step to making children of migrants feel better about themselves and make them ready to learn . " in many families the mother tongue is spoken .
this is okay .
however , the medium of instruction at school is german .
and if the children do not understand what the teacher or their class-mates say , i can imagine that they can get angry because they really want to understand everything . " sponsored language courses bridging the divide the language barrier is something the school is hoping to breach through with extra-curricular language classes .
many parents themselves have a basic grasp of german or little education themselves and therefore can not help their children at home .
and as many come from deprived backgrounds , the school is offering the classes for free after securing financial support from sponsors such as mercator , the european network for regional or minority languages and education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the cologne school are enthusiastic language learners .
" the children want to be integrated into normal school life , ” said language teacher lina wienold .
“ this is because they want to speak like the german children and so the motivation is high . ” mercator chairperson annabel von klenck said : " this project is a big success .
nobody has talked about federalism , nobody has talked about policy .
nobody has talked a lot about money .
enough sponsors have been found .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.11.2005 prada pope causes " cassock war " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's taste in comfortable cassocks have led to a vatican row with his penchant for designer eyewear and italian shoes , pope benedict xvi is becoming an unlikely style icon .
a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

“ we take a very dim view of the connection between social origin and achievement at school .
it is something that must be addressed , ” she said in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . claudia roth , leader of the green party , called the latest pisa study another “ slap in the face " for the german education system while outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering admitted : “ the state of education in germany is not good . ” poor migrant children particulary affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children from poor families face an uphill struggle for a good education .
while german politicians bemoan the state of affairs , the country 's president horst köhler this week assessed the situation first hand by paying a visit to a school in cologne . one the most damaging conclusions of the latest study is that children from migrant backgrounds are particularly likely to underperform and also fail to integrate properly in society if their parents come from a lower social class and fail to support them adequately . " it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .

principal ursula stumpf believes that integration helps the children settle at school and feel comfortable to learn regardless of their economic background .
she has found that a good grasp of the german language is the first step to making children of migrants feel better about themselves and make them ready to learn . " in many families the mother tongue is spoken .
this is okay .
however , the medium of instruction at school is german .
and if the children do not understand what the teacher or their class-mates say , i can imagine that they can get angry because they really want to understand everything . " sponsored language courses bridging the divide the language barrier is something the school is hoping to breach through with extra-curricular language classes .
many parents themselves have a basic grasp of german or little education themselves and therefore can not help their children at home .
and as many come from deprived backgrounds , the school is offering the classes for free after securing financial support from sponsors such as mercator , the european network for regional or minority languages and education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the cologne school are enthusiastic language learners .
" the children want to be integrated into normal school life , ” said language teacher lina wienold .
“ this is because they want to speak like the german children and so the motivation is high . ” mercator chairperson annabel von klenck said : " this project is a big success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.11.2005 " ethnoportals " link minority communities in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying connected to home is important for immigrants while newspapers and even tv channels aimed at foreigners in german are common these days , minority communities are finding more interactive ways to communicate with one another - through web portals . every evening after work , maria knauf sits down at her computer and types in her password for the web site www.germany.ru.
on the site she 's " kiska , " which means something close to " kitten , " and once she 's logged on , she checks out who 's online .
" i already see a couple of names i know , " she said as she started typing .
" i 've chatted with ' tante anna ' before so i 'd better say hi . "
for knauf , germany.ru allows her to feel a little closer to home every evening , since it enables her to chat with other russians in germany , catch up on news back in russia , or exchange experiences about their new lives in a country that is still very foreign for many of them .
" it 's simply a place where i can meet like-minded people who speak my language and who i do n't have to explain myself to , " she said .
" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .
the site has 300,000 registered members and some 30,000 visit the pages every day , making it the most-visited site for russian users in western europe .
most of the surfers who stop by are young people who have immigrated to germany .
" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .
but in germany , it was a virtual desert .
" we thought there should be something for us since there are so many turks living in germany , " said tamir kulmac , one of the brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.vaybee.de they set up vaybee ! , which means " wow ! " or " great ! " in turkish .
today , vaybee.de is the most successful turkish portal in germany , with some 400,000 members .
" it 's supposed to be a community , with discussion forums , chat functions , e-mail , that kind of thing , " said kulmac .
" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .
the webmasters know that in the fast-moving world of the internet , change is the only constant , and they frequently update their sites and add new features .
they have to , since they 're not the only kids on the block anymore - thousands of imitators of all ethnic stripes have put their own portals on line now .
home-grown crowd as well the portals do n't only appeal to brand-new arrivals to germany .
many of the users on vaybee ! are german-turks who were born or grew up in germany , and speak the language like natives .
in a recent survey , the site found out that some 40 percent of its users are women , a fact which kulmac did n't expect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some women , ethnoportals are an idea forum for meeting new people he says , however , after thinking about it , he realized that the forum was ideal for turkish women , who , because of a more conservative culture , can be less willing to pursue traditional ways of getting out and getting to know people .
" people can meet , flirt , or date on our site , but all in a secure and , if you want , anonymous environment , " he said . nadja baeva -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virtual battle between serbs and croats hackers in the former yugoslavia have been going at it .

witnesses told europe 1 radio that flames shot 50 meters -lrb- 160 feet -rrb- into the air with repeated explosions . five officers were slightly hurt by flying objects as rioters once again stoned police and fire services in several neighbourhoods , and at neuilly-sur-marne to the east of paris buckshot was fired at vans belonging to the crs riot squad . teen deaths sparked riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters stand by a wrecked bus in a paris suburb on thursday the rioting , which began after the accidental deaths of two youths hiding in an electrical sub-station at clichy-sous-bois to escape a police identity check , is the worst france has seen since the first troubles broke out in deprived , high-immigration neighbourhoods in the late 1980s . those responsible are mainly groups of young muslim men who have said in interviews that they are protesting against economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . small-scale suburban violence is a regular but little reported fact of life in many poor areas on the outskirts of major french cities .

" what we have been witnessing ... has nothing spontaneous about it .
it was perfectly organized .
we are trying to find out by who and how , " he said . prime minister dominique de villepin on thursday vowed before parliament that authorities " will not give in " to the violence and would make restoring order their " absolute top priority " . " i will not allow organized gangs to make the law in the suburbs , " he declared . france has 751 neighborhoods officially classed as severely disadvantaged , housing a total of five million people , around 8 percent of the population . many of france 's estimated five million muslims live in those suburbs .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .
vw said its position in the us market had " stabilized " towards the end of the third quarter , thanks to the launch of the new jetta and passat models , as well as audi a4 and audi a6 . " we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter .
however , due to the difficult market situation there , we will not match the previous year 's delivery levels , " the car maker said .

on the site she 's " kiska , " which means something close to " kitten , " and once she 's logged on , she checks out who 's online .
" i already see a couple of names i know , " she said as she started typing .
" i 've chatted with ' tante anna ' before so i 'd better say hi . "
for knauf , germany.ru allows her to feel a little closer to home every evening , since it enables her to chat with other russians in germany , catch up on news back in russia , or exchange experiences about their new lives in a country that is still very foreign for many of them .
" it 's simply a place where i can meet like-minded people who speak my language and who i do n't have to explain myself to , " she said .
" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .
the site has 300,000 registered members and some 30,000 visit the pages every day , making it the most-visited site for russian users in western europe .
most of the surfers who stop by are young people who have immigrated to germany .
" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .
but in germany , it was a virtual desert .
" we thought there should be something for us since there are so many turks living in germany , " said tamir kulmac , one of the brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.vaybee.de they set up vaybee ! , which means " wow ! " or " great ! " in turkish .
today , vaybee.de is the most successful turkish portal in germany , with some 400,000 members .
" it 's supposed to be a community , with discussion forums , chat functions , e-mail , that kind of thing , " said kulmac .
" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .
the webmasters know that in the fast-moving world of the internet , change is the only constant , and they frequently update their sites and add new features .
they have to , since they 're not the only kids on the block anymore - thousands of imitators of all ethnic stripes have put their own portals on line now .
home-grown crowd as well the portals do n't only appeal to brand-new arrivals to germany .
many of the users on vaybee ! are german-turks who were born or grew up in germany , and speak the language like natives .
in a recent survey , the site found out that some 40 percent of its users are women , a fact which kulmac did n't expect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some women , ethnoportals are an idea forum for meeting new people he says , however , after thinking about it , he realized that the forum was ideal for turkish women , who , because of a more conservative culture , can be less willing to pursue traditional ways of getting out and getting to know people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.11.2005 rioting unlikely in germany , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany so far has not witnessed the kind of violence raging in france france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .
could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos . " i do n't see any parallel societies developing there , " bade said .
" these are relatively mixed areas . " better integration needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , it 's mainly germans who riot but he added that germans had to realize that they would have to shoulder major costs in the long run if they do not improve existing integration programs . bade said germany should set up a three-tier system of intergration : helping those willing to come to germany learn the language before they arrive , supporting them once they 've immigrated and looking after those who have failed to get on their feet once they 're in the country . " that costs a lot of money , but if we do n't do it , we 'll pay for it dearly in the long run , " he said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting in paris continues a week of suburban violence in france showed no sign of abating friday after an eighth night of clashes and car-burning which for the first time spread beyond the capital .

witnesses told europe 1 radio that flames shot 50 meters -lrb- 160 feet -rrb- into the air with repeated explosions . five officers were slightly hurt by flying objects as rioters once again stoned police and fire services in several neighbourhoods , and at neuilly-sur-marne to the east of paris buckshot was fired at vans belonging to the crs riot squad . teen deaths sparked riots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters stand by a wrecked bus in a paris suburb on thursday the rioting , which began after the accidental deaths of two youths hiding in an electrical sub-station at clichy-sous-bois to escape a police identity check , is the worst france has seen since the first troubles broke out in deprived , high-immigration neighbourhoods in the late 1980s . those responsible are mainly groups of young muslim men who have said in interviews that they are protesting against economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . small-scale suburban violence is a regular but little reported fact of life in many poor areas on the outskirts of major french cities .
according to the police intelligence service rg a total of 28,000 cars have been burned across the country this year - even before the latest outbreak . rattling the government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the riots are a direct challenge to french prime minister de villepin , and interior minister sarkozy the violence has badly rattled the government of president jacques chirac , which is wavering between the " zero tolerance " policies of the hardline interior minister nicolas sarkozy and calls for a more conciliatory approach to take account of the rioters ' grievances . speaking on french television thursday evening , sarkozy said that the violence was being orchestrated by unknown organizers . " what we have been witnessing ... has nothing spontaneous about it .
it was perfectly organized .
we are trying to find out by who and how , " he said . prime minister dominique de villepin on thursday vowed before parliament that authorities " will not give in " to the violence and would make restoring order their " absolute top priority " . " i will not allow organized gangs to make the law in the suburbs , " he declared . france has 751 neighborhoods officially classed as severely disadvantaged , housing a total of five million people , around 8 percent of the population . many of france 's estimated five million muslims live in those suburbs .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .

" gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .

" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .
the site has 300,000 registered members and some 30,000 visit the pages every day , making it the most-visited site for russian users in western europe .
most of the surfers who stop by are young people who have immigrated to germany .
" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .

" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .

could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth . " immigrants feel like guests " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare sign of german pride " immigrants -lrb- in germany -rrb- still feel like guests , " said ruud koopmans , a sociology professor at amsterdam 's vrije universiteit , who previously worked at berlin 's center for social research . " turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos .

experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .
in addition to his love of designer sunglasses , the pope has favored padded quilt jackets , jumpsuits , baseball caps and red prada shoes . it is said that the pope still retains the same furniture from his old flat and also carries the same beaten up old leather briefcase which he has had for years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .

" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .

" gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .

" it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .
vw said its position in the us market had " stabilized " towards the end of the third quarter , thanks to the launch of the new jetta and passat models , as well as audi a4 and audi a6 . " we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter .
however , due to the difficult market situation there , we will not match the previous year 's delivery levels , " the car maker said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.11.2005 " ethnoportals " link minority communities in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying connected to home is important for immigrants while newspapers and even tv channels aimed at foreigners in german are common these days , minority communities are finding more interactive ways to communicate with one another - through web portals . every evening after work , maria knauf sits down at her computer and types in her password for the web site www.germany.ru.
on the site she 's " kiska , " which means something close to " kitten , " and once she 's logged on , she checks out who 's online .
" i already see a couple of names i know , " she said as she started typing .
" i 've chatted with ' tante anna ' before so i 'd better say hi . "
for knauf , germany.ru allows her to feel a little closer to home every evening , since it enables her to chat with other russians in germany , catch up on news back in russia , or exchange experiences about their new lives in a country that is still very foreign for many of them .
" it 's simply a place where i can meet like-minded people who speak my language and who i do n't have to explain myself to , " she said .
" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .
the site has 300,000 registered members and some 30,000 visit the pages every day , making it the most-visited site for russian users in western europe .
most of the surfers who stop by are young people who have immigrated to germany .
" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .
but in germany , it was a virtual desert .
" we thought there should be something for us since there are so many turks living in germany , " said tamir kulmac , one of the brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.vaybee.de they set up vaybee ! , which means " wow ! " or " great ! " in turkish .
today , vaybee.de is the most successful turkish portal in germany , with some 400,000 members .
" it 's supposed to be a community , with discussion forums , chat functions , e-mail , that kind of thing , " said kulmac .
" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .
the webmasters know that in the fast-moving world of the internet , change is the only constant , and they frequently update their sites and add new features .
they have to , since they 're not the only kids on the block anymore - thousands of imitators of all ethnic stripes have put their own portals on line now .
home-grown crowd as well the portals do n't only appeal to brand-new arrivals to germany .
many of the users on vaybee ! are german-turks who were born or grew up in germany , and speak the language like natives .
in a recent survey , the site found out that some 40 percent of its users are women , a fact which kulmac did n't expect .

" it 's a large aircraft so one could imagine a large group of detainees flying on this plane , as against some other smaller executive jets that they used , " he told afp .
" the fact that it stops in eastern europe , then morocco and then guantanamo suggests different classes of prisoners being deposited in different places . " in brussels , a spokesman for hrw 's belgian branch , jean-paul marthoz , said " inquiries up until now seem to indicate that poland and romania are the countries that received prisoners held by the cia . " he refused to rule out the cia could be holding " ghost prisoners " elsewhere in eastern europe . eu satisfied the european commission has no specific suspicions that the us central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- is running secret prisons in eastern europe , a spokesman said on friday .
" at this time we do not have any specific suspicion , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs at the eu 's executive arm . he said the commission was also satisfied with official denials from romania and poland that such facilities existed on their territories . " i think the statements by the romanian and polish authorities are crystal clear , " roscam abbing said .
" all of those official declarations deny the existence of such possible prisons .
we do not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time .

" the icrc , for some time already , has repeatedly raised the issue of receiving notification and subsequently access to persons held in undisclosed places of detention , in the context of the so called ' war on terror , ' she said .
" we have not reached an agreement with the us authorities so far - our confidential dialogue with them continues . " the icrc currently conducts confidential visits to detainees held at the us military base at guantanamo bay and in afghanistan and iraq .
notari said there had been instances in which us had given news of an arrest but the detainee was not at any of the locations the organization had visited . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us has secret cia prisons in eastern europe the eu will examine whether the cia operates secret prisons , known as " black sites " for al qaeda suspects in eastern europe and elsewhere around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.11.2005 german education failures linked to social background großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest pisa study has again uncovered major deficits the latest pisa educational study results released in germany thursday , confirmed what had already been suspected for long : the success of children at school is closely linked to their social status . the most recent pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- study indicates that children from more affluent backgrounds have between four and six times as much chance of passing their final school exams and making it to university than those from poorer backgrounds . the results have sparked shock and embarrassment among german officials across the political spectrum as it once again showed that the connection between social origin and educational competence is still too high . edelgard bulmahn , current minister of education and her designated successor annette schavan both demanded that steps should be taken to ensure that school success no longer hinges on social standing . “ the chances of getting a good high school education are as much as six times higher for children from economically sound backgrounds than those from families in poorer social standings , ” bulmahn criticized . schavan echoed the incumbent education minister ’ s opinion .
“ we take a very dim view of the connection between social origin and achievement at school .
it is something that must be addressed , ” she said in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . claudia roth , leader of the green party , called the latest pisa study another “ slap in the face " for the german education system while outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering admitted : “ the state of education in germany is not good . ” poor migrant children particulary affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children from poor families face an uphill struggle for a good education .
while german politicians bemoan the state of affairs , the country 's president horst köhler this week assessed the situation first hand by paying a visit to a school in cologne . one the most damaging conclusions of the latest study is that children from migrant backgrounds are particularly likely to underperform and also fail to integrate properly in society if their parents come from a lower social class and fail to support them adequately . " it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .
around one third of the areas inhabitants are foreigners , half of which are turkish .
only about half of the 270 children who attend the school have german parents . mixed culture school addressing the problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixed culture schools have the added problem of the language barrier .
principal ursula stumpf believes that integration helps the children settle at school and feel comfortable to learn regardless of their economic background .
she has found that a good grasp of the german language is the first step to making children of migrants feel better about themselves and make them ready to learn . " in many families the mother tongue is spoken .
this is okay .
however , the medium of instruction at school is german .
and if the children do not understand what the teacher or their class-mates say , i can imagine that they can get angry because they really want to understand everything . " sponsored language courses bridging the divide the language barrier is something the school is hoping to breach through with extra-curricular language classes .
many parents themselves have a basic grasp of german or little education themselves and therefore can not help their children at home .
and as many come from deprived backgrounds , the school is offering the classes for free after securing financial support from sponsors such as mercator , the european network for regional or minority languages and education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the cologne school are enthusiastic language learners .
" the children want to be integrated into normal school life , ” said language teacher lina wienold .
“ this is because they want to speak like the german children and so the motivation is high . ” mercator chairperson annabel von klenck said : " this project is a big success .
nobody has talked about federalism , nobody has talked about policy .
nobody has talked a lot about money .
enough sponsors have been found .

" it 's a large aircraft so one could imagine a large group of detainees flying on this plane , as against some other smaller executive jets that they used , " he told afp .
" the fact that it stops in eastern europe , then morocco and then guantanamo suggests different classes of prisoners being deposited in different places . " in brussels , a spokesman for hrw 's belgian branch , jean-paul marthoz , said " inquiries up until now seem to indicate that poland and romania are the countries that received prisoners held by the cia . " he refused to rule out the cia could be holding " ghost prisoners " elsewhere in eastern europe . eu satisfied the european commission has no specific suspicions that the us central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- is running secret prisons in eastern europe , a spokesman said on friday .
" at this time we do not have any specific suspicion , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs at the eu 's executive arm . he said the commission was also satisfied with official denials from romania and poland that such facilities existed on their territories . " i think the statements by the romanian and polish authorities are crystal clear , " roscam abbing said .
" all of those official declarations deny the existence of such possible prisons .
we do not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time .
having said that , we will continue to monitor the situation . " the eu commission had said thursday it would review whether the cia operates secret prisons in eastern europe , noting that such facilities would not comply with eu treaties . icrc " increasingly concerned " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't admit or deny the cia prisons the international committee of the red cross said friday that it had so far failed to reach an agreement with the us about access to terror suspects held abroad secretly , despite some two years of talks . following newspaper reports this week about secret cia prisons for terror suspects abroad , spokeswoman antonella notari said the icrc had been pressing washington on the issue since at least january 2004 . " the icrc , for some time already , has repeatedly raised the issue of receiving notification and subsequently access to persons held in undisclosed places of detention , in the context of the so called ' war on terror , ' she said .
" we have not reached an agreement with the us authorities so far - our confidential dialogue with them continues . " the icrc currently conducts confidential visits to detainees held at the us military base at guantanamo bay and in afghanistan and iraq .
notari said there had been instances in which us had given news of an arrest but the detainee was not at any of the locations the organization had visited . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us has secret cia prisons in eastern europe the eu will examine whether the cia operates secret prisons , known as " black sites " for al qaeda suspects in eastern europe and elsewhere around the world .

it 's a welcome piece of good news for the country 's strained public finances . the ministry said it was set to receive 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- more than originally expected in tax revenues in 2005 and 2006 combined , but it warned that germany 's public finances would nevertheless remain " extremely tight . " the federal , regional and municipal authorities were set to receive 447.9 billion euros in tax revenues this year , 2.9 billion euros more than previously budgeted , the finance ministry said in a statement . the increase was attributable to lower federal transfers to the eu , and increased trade tax at a municipal level . next year good , too next year , tax revenues would amount to 457.4 billion euros , 0.9 billion euros more than previously budgeted , again due to positive developments in trade tax , which is a sort of income tax for companies , the ministry estimated . " it is the first time in a long time that tax revenue forecasts have been revised upwards , " the ministry said .
" at the same time , it must be stated that the financial situation of all public budgets remains extremely tight , " it added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finance ministry calculates higher trade taxes are one cause of the surplus the federal budget alone would actually see a slight fall in revenues next year as a result of the still low rate of economic growth in germany , the ministry said .
in addition , gasoline tax revenues were set to decline as runaway oil prices weighed on consumption . berlin recently cut its forecast for growth next year to 1.2 percent from 1.6 percent , blaming high oil prices which it said would put the brakes on growth . getting germany 's public finances back in order is one of the pressing tasks facing the incoming government coalition of social democrat spd and conservative cdu / csu parties . the incoming government under chancellor-to-be angela merkel has calculated that 35 billion euros should be cut from the budget in 2007 , which would translate into 425 euros in belt-tightening per person , or 1,350 euros for everyone in a job and paying social security . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de massive national budget cuts likely in germany a new round of talks on forming a grand coalition government in germany ended with a call for germans to tighten their belts as tens of billions of euros must be saved in the national budget over the coming years .

on the site she 's " kiska , " which means something close to " kitten , " and once she 's logged on , she checks out who 's online .
" i already see a couple of names i know , " she said as she started typing .
" i 've chatted with ' tante anna ' before so i 'd better say hi . "
for knauf , germany.ru allows her to feel a little closer to home every evening , since it enables her to chat with other russians in germany , catch up on news back in russia , or exchange experiences about their new lives in a country that is still very foreign for many of them .
" it 's simply a place where i can meet like-minded people who speak my language and who i do n't have to explain myself to , " she said .
" that means a lot in a foreign country and naturally we stick to people we know . "
familiar place sites like germany.ru , so-called " ethnoportals , " are dedicated to minority communities in a country , giving them a forum where they can be surrounded by the familiar .
judging by the number of users on the russian site , it 's a growing need .
the site has 300,000 registered members and some 30,000 visit the pages every day , making it the most-visited site for russian users in western europe .
most of the surfers who stop by are young people who have immigrated to germany .
" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .
but in germany , it was a virtual desert .
" we thought there should be something for us since there are so many turks living in germany , " said tamir kulmac , one of the brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.vaybee.de they set up vaybee ! , which means " wow ! " or " great ! " in turkish .
today , vaybee.de is the most successful turkish portal in germany , with some 400,000 members .
" it 's supposed to be a community , with discussion forums , chat functions , e-mail , that kind of thing , " said kulmac .
" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .
the webmasters know that in the fast-moving world of the internet , change is the only constant , and they frequently update their sites and add new features .
they have to , since they 're not the only kids on the block anymore - thousands of imitators of all ethnic stripes have put their own portals on line now .
home-grown crowd as well the portals do n't only appeal to brand-new arrivals to germany .

" in 1999 i registered the name germany.ru in russia without really thinking about it too much , " said andreas brückmann , founder of the site and an ethnic german who immigrated to germany from saint petersburg .
" back then , i did n't really have an idea about what i would make out of the site .
i just liked the address . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany.ru is like a comfortable living room for russians in germany but now the site has taken off , and has information on music , bands , movies , and russian television as well as a popular dating service .
in fact , it ’ s the matchmaking that draws most people to the portal , according to brückmann .
in surveys , he 's found that nearly 40 percent of the site 's users are hoping to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend there .
many are successful .
" i think we 've already celebrated thousands of weddings and i 'm constantly invited to the happy occasions by people i do n't even know , " he said .
" of course , at this point there are quite a few germany.ru kids out there .
i 'm glad i played a role in that . "
turkish cyber-hangout at about the same time the germany.ru went online , three turkish brothers living in germany had a similar idea , and created a place for turks in germany to gather in cyberspace .
they had noted that in the us , there were already a multitude of sites for minorities : for asians , latinos , african-americans , etc .
but in germany , it was a virtual desert .
" we thought there should be something for us since there are so many turks living in germany , " said tamir kulmac , one of the brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.vaybee.de they set up vaybee ! , which means " wow ! " or " great ! " in turkish .
today , vaybee.de is the most successful turkish portal in germany , with some 400,000 members .
" it 's supposed to be a community , with discussion forums , chat functions , e-mail , that kind of thing , " said kulmac .
" but it 's developed beyond that . "
full range of services it 's now become a company , which , like any enterprise , needs to earn money .
so several income-generating areas have been put online , such as a dating service , an online shop and a travel portal , which today has more german clients than turkish ones .
vaybee ! 's russian equivalent also offers a whole palette of services , although instead of sending travelers to foreign countries , brückmann organizes tours in germany for russian rock groups .
the webmasters know that in the fast-moving world of the internet , change is the only constant , and they frequently update their sites and add new features .
they have to , since they 're not the only kids on the block anymore - thousands of imitators of all ethnic stripes have put their own portals on line now .
home-grown crowd as well the portals do n't only appeal to brand-new arrivals to germany .
many of the users on vaybee ! are german-turks who were born or grew up in germany , and speak the language like natives .
in a recent survey , the site found out that some 40 percent of its users are women , a fact which kulmac did n't expect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some women , ethnoportals are an idea forum for meeting new people he says , however , after thinking about it , he realized that the forum was ideal for turkish women , who , because of a more conservative culture , can be less willing to pursue traditional ways of getting out and getting to know people .
" people can meet , flirt , or date on our site , but all in a secure and , if you want , anonymous environment , " he said . nadja baeva -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de virtual battle between serbs and croats hackers in the former yugoslavia have been going at it .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .
vw said its position in the us market had " stabilized " towards the end of the third quarter , thanks to the launch of the new jetta and passat models , as well as audi a4 and audi a6 . " we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter .
however , due to the difficult market situation there , we will not match the previous year 's delivery levels , " the car maker said .
in western europe , vw expected to increase its market share , particularly in germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen unable to sell europcar so far with a need to get itself back into shape , europe 's largest car manufacturer is selling off its restructuring operations and subsidiaries .

it 's a welcome piece of good news for the country 's strained public finances . the ministry said it was set to receive 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- more than originally expected in tax revenues in 2005 and 2006 combined , but it warned that germany 's public finances would nevertheless remain " extremely tight . " the federal , regional and municipal authorities were set to receive 447.9 billion euros in tax revenues this year , 2.9 billion euros more than previously budgeted , the finance ministry said in a statement . the increase was attributable to lower federal transfers to the eu , and increased trade tax at a municipal level . next year good , too next year , tax revenues would amount to 457.4 billion euros , 0.9 billion euros more than previously budgeted , again due to positive developments in trade tax , which is a sort of income tax for companies , the ministry estimated .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .
it was also suggested in the vatican newspaper , the tablet , that benedict was forced to wear one of three " stock " cassocks supplied by gammarelli for the eventual winner of the conclave .
unfortunately , none fitted properly and the cassock , which hovered above the pope 's ankles , caused some amusement , " the paper wrote .
" is it possible that papa ratzinger did not find it very funny ? " gammarelli has angrily denied that his services were no longer being used .
" this is an ungracious falsehood , " he said .
" we are always in contact with the apartment of the holy father .
perhaps there was only an occasional gift by some friend of the pontiff . " gammarelli 's first papal client was pius vi , a man renowned for his vanity and frequently lampooned for his narcissism . third party cited in escalating " cassock wars " however , a conflicting report in the corriere della sera newspaper muddied the waters further by claiming that benedict had abandoned both gammarelli and mancinelli in favor of a return to alessandro cattaneo , a tailor whom the pope used when he was cardinal ratzinger . whichever tailor the pope has now switched to , it is widely seen as a betrayal of hundreds of years of tradition , a claim that has been vehemently denied by vatican sources which also claimed that gammarelli remained the official supplier of attire to the holy father . benedict a fan of designer goods and old favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what every fashion conscious pontiff is wearing : red prada loafers .
it is another example of the surprising individualism of a pope many saw as the most straightlaced of pontiffs .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors . pope benedict xvi would come pretty far down on many people ’ s list of ‘ most fashionable icons ' despite his penchant for prada shoes and designer sunglasses .
but the german-born pontiff is currently at the center of one of the vatican ’ s more bizarre controversies , one which revolves around the fiber of his fabric . the stylish benedict has angered many in the holy city by allegedly switching allegiances from the company which has made papal robes for over 200 years to a tailor who has only been in business for a tenth of that time . in what is being called the “ cassock wars , ” both tailors are said to be squaring up for a dispute over the papal contract in a bid to win the pope ’ s favor .
annibale gammarelli , of the eponymous firm of outfitters who have been making papal cassocks since 1792 , is locked in a struggle with mancinelli , a small shop that has been operating for a mere 20 years . it was reported in october that the pope had ditched gammarelli ’ s robes , which it was claimed made the pontiff feel uncomfortable , and tradition in favor of raniero mancinelli ’ s more loose-fitting threads . was pope 's conclave cassock too short ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope was said to be less than happy with the short cassock .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .

" it 's a large aircraft so one could imagine a large group of detainees flying on this plane , as against some other smaller executive jets that they used , " he told afp .
" the fact that it stops in eastern europe , then morocco and then guantanamo suggests different classes of prisoners being deposited in different places . " in brussels , a spokesman for hrw 's belgian branch , jean-paul marthoz , said " inquiries up until now seem to indicate that poland and romania are the countries that received prisoners held by the cia . " he refused to rule out the cia could be holding " ghost prisoners " elsewhere in eastern europe . eu satisfied the european commission has no specific suspicions that the us central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- is running secret prisons in eastern europe , a spokesman said on friday .
" at this time we do not have any specific suspicion , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs at the eu 's executive arm . he said the commission was also satisfied with official denials from romania and poland that such facilities existed on their territories . " i think the statements by the romanian and polish authorities are crystal clear , " roscam abbing said .
" all of those official declarations deny the existence of such possible prisons .
we do not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time .
having said that , we will continue to monitor the situation . " the eu commission had said thursday it would review whether the cia operates secret prisons in eastern europe , noting that such facilities would not comply with eu treaties . icrc " increasingly concerned " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't admit or deny the cia prisons the international committee of the red cross said friday that it had so far failed to reach an agreement with the us about access to terror suspects held abroad secretly , despite some two years of talks . following newspaper reports this week about secret cia prisons for terror suspects abroad , spokeswoman antonella notari said the icrc had been pressing washington on the issue since at least january 2004 . " the icrc , for some time already , has repeatedly raised the issue of receiving notification and subsequently access to persons held in undisclosed places of detention , in the context of the so called ' war on terror , ' she said .
" we have not reached an agreement with the us authorities so far - our confidential dialogue with them continues . " the icrc currently conducts confidential visits to detainees held at the us military base at guantanamo bay and in afghanistan and iraq .
notari said there had been instances in which us had given news of an arrest but the detainee was not at any of the locations the organization had visited . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us has secret cia prisons in eastern europe the eu will examine whether the cia operates secret prisons , known as " black sites " for al qaeda suspects in eastern europe and elsewhere around the world .

could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth .

" turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany .

" we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos .

experts are skeptical . in a ninth night of rioting which saw violence spread to towns beyond the french capital , rioters torched hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern paris as france grappled with the worst race riots in decades that have made headlines around the world . amid the charred wreckage and mounting anger over what is seen as the government 's slow response , many in france are trying to come up with an explanation . those allegedly responsible - groups of young muslim men of largely north african and black african origin - have said that they are protesting economic misery , racial discrimination and provocative policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charred busses in paris but while some blame the government 's recent hardline law-and-order policies , others see the root of the problem in broken promises by the french government to its immigrant communities : the french integration model insists that all citizens are equal before the state , but some say cultural minorities are being left without a voice . in germany , on the other hand , immigrants have so far lacked any sense of entitlement .
unlike france , britain or the netherlands , berlin has only recently opened up citizenship and loosened naturalization laws . some say this might be one of the reasons why similar riots have not taken place in germany so far .
the country is home to europe 's second-largest muslim population - an estimated 3.7 million - after france and has a two-million-strong turkish minority . the only thing in germany that even comes close to the kind of violence raging in france currently , is the traditional labor day demonstration in berlin that often ends in cars being set ablaze and clashes between the police and youth .

" turks still see themselves to a large extent as turks and not germans .
only once they start seeing themselves as -lrb- citizens -rrb- , they start making demands on the society in which they live . " koopmans added that violence among immigrants in germany is actually more common than in france , but still tends to be related to conflicts in their countries of origins .
he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany .

he named aggression between turks and kurds and between different ethnic groups from the former yugoslavia as examples . " in france , you find almost no political violence that is related to homeland violence , " koopmans said , adding that he expects the situation in germany to change as more immigrants start to feel like citizens of germany . " only then will they start making demands and there will be an increase in the kind of conflicts that you seen in france , " he said . no immigrant ghettos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's oranienstrasse is a favorite for turks and germans alike others disagreed , saying that since immigrant ghettos like the ones in france , britain or the netherlands did n't exist in germany , riots were less likely to happen . " we do n't have these closed clusters of immigrants , " said klaus j. bade , who directs the institute for migration research and intercultural studies at osnabrück university . immigrant-dominated neighborhoods such as berlin 's kreuzberg and neukölln are undoubtedly social hot spots , but bade pointed out that they were still far from being ghettos . " i do n't see any parallel societies developing there , " bade said .
" these are relatively mixed areas . " better integration needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so far , it 's mainly germans who riot but he added that germans had to realize that they would have to shoulder major costs in the long run if they do not improve existing integration programs . bade said germany should set up a three-tier system of intergration : helping those willing to come to germany learn the language before they arrive , supporting them once they 've immigrated and looking after those who have failed to get on their feet once they 're in the country . " that costs a lot of money , but if we do n't do it , we 'll pay for it dearly in the long run , " he said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting in paris continues a week of suburban violence in france showed no sign of abating friday after an eighth night of clashes and car-burning which for the first time spread beyond the capital .

“ we take a very dim view of the connection between social origin and achievement at school .
it is something that must be addressed , ” she said in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . claudia roth , leader of the green party , called the latest pisa study another “ slap in the face " for the german education system while outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering admitted : “ the state of education in germany is not good . ” poor migrant children particulary affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children from poor families face an uphill struggle for a good education .
while german politicians bemoan the state of affairs , the country 's president horst köhler this week assessed the situation first hand by paying a visit to a school in cologne . one the most damaging conclusions of the latest study is that children from migrant backgrounds are particularly likely to underperform and also fail to integrate properly in society if their parents come from a lower social class and fail to support them adequately . " it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .

" it 's a large aircraft so one could imagine a large group of detainees flying on this plane , as against some other smaller executive jets that they used , " he told afp .
" the fact that it stops in eastern europe , then morocco and then guantanamo suggests different classes of prisoners being deposited in different places . " in brussels , a spokesman for hrw 's belgian branch , jean-paul marthoz , said " inquiries up until now seem to indicate that poland and romania are the countries that received prisoners held by the cia . " he refused to rule out the cia could be holding " ghost prisoners " elsewhere in eastern europe . eu satisfied the european commission has no specific suspicions that the us central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- is running secret prisons in eastern europe , a spokesman said on friday .
" at this time we do not have any specific suspicion , " said friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs at the eu 's executive arm . he said the commission was also satisfied with official denials from romania and poland that such facilities existed on their territories . " i think the statements by the romanian and polish authorities are crystal clear , " roscam abbing said .
" all of those official declarations deny the existence of such possible prisons .
we do not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time .
having said that , we will continue to monitor the situation . " the eu commission had said thursday it would review whether the cia operates secret prisons in eastern europe , noting that such facilities would not comply with eu treaties . icrc " increasingly concerned " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house wo n't admit or deny the cia prisons the international committee of the red cross said friday that it had so far failed to reach an agreement with the us about access to terror suspects held abroad secretly , despite some two years of talks . following newspaper reports this week about secret cia prisons for terror suspects abroad , spokeswoman antonella notari said the icrc had been pressing washington on the issue since at least january 2004 . " the icrc , for some time already , has repeatedly raised the issue of receiving notification and subsequently access to persons held in undisclosed places of detention , in the context of the so called ' war on terror , ' she said .
" we have not reached an agreement with the us authorities so far - our confidential dialogue with them continues . " the icrc currently conducts confidential visits to detainees held at the us military base at guantanamo bay and in afghanistan and iraq .
notari said there had been instances in which us had given news of an arrest but the detainee was not at any of the locations the organization had visited . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us has secret cia prisons in eastern europe the eu will examine whether the cia operates secret prisons , known as " black sites " for al qaeda suspects in eastern europe and elsewhere around the world .

the company said in a statement that it booked net profit of 282 million euros -lrb- $ 338 million -rrb- in the period from july to september ; nearly four times the 76 million euros booked a year earlier . at the same time , operating profit rose by 49.6 percent to 586 million euros , revenues were up 12.6 percent at 23.857 billion euros and unit sales climbed by 6.1 percent to 1.305 million cars worldwide , the statement said . taking the first nine months of the year as a whole , net profit climbed by 49 percent to 685 million euros and operating profit rose by 58 percent to 1.961 billion euros .
nine-month revenues were up 5.3 percent at 69.873 billion euros and unit sales rose by 3.1 percent to 3.864 million vehicles , the car maker said . vw : quarterly results justify painful restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cost-cutting at vw has boosted profits but the restructuring continues .
" developments in the third quarter show that our steps to improve our performance have been successful , " the statement read .
" in a difficult environment , however , substantial efforts will still be needed in the coming years to achieve our targets . " vw said that in the first nine months , cost-savings made a positive contribution to earnings of 2.6 billion euros . the car maker was therefore well on its way to achieving its target of boosting full-year earnings this year by 3.1 billion euros via cost-cutting , the statement added . vw was also satisfied with the success of its new models , the fox , passat , audis a4 and a3 and the skoda octavia , which helped boost european sales , it said . job cuts to hit germany hardest in coming months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european jobs are at risk , particularly in germany .
however , the prospect for the rest of the year looked bleaker .
the company cautioned that fourth-quarter profits would be burdened by restructuring costs connected with the job cuts - still be quantified - announced in the autumn . press reports have suggested that about 14,000 jobs could be axed in europe , with around 10,000 german jobs on the line .
vw chief financial officer hans dieter pötsch confirmed on thursday that the company would cut " thousands " of german jobs as record raw material prices eat into earnings .
" we have to reduce the workforce a considerable amount , " said pötsch during a conference call with analysts . european carmakers have been struggling to cope with a strengthening euro , which makes vehicles more expensive in countries like the united states and china .
the industry has also been hit by escalating prices for steel and oil , both of which reached records in the past year .
on top of these factors , the demand for new cars has been stagnant in europe for the past three years as unemployment hovered near record highs in germany . problems with raw materials likely to continue vw said it expected competitive pressures to intensify further , particularly in the key us and chinese markets .
" nor do we expect any easing in the cost of raw materials in the foreseeable future .
moreover , we believe that the high oil price and the resulting record high fuel prices will further dampen automotive consumer confidence , " the company statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new passat has contributed to vw 's stabilization in the us .
vw said its position in the us market had " stabilized " towards the end of the third quarter , thanks to the launch of the new jetta and passat models , as well as audi a4 and audi a6 . " we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter .
however , due to the difficult market situation there , we will not match the previous year 's delivery levels , " the car maker said .

“ we take a very dim view of the connection between social origin and achievement at school .
it is something that must be addressed , ” she said in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . claudia roth , leader of the green party , called the latest pisa study another “ slap in the face " for the german education system while outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering admitted : “ the state of education in germany is not good . ” poor migrant children particulary affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children from poor families face an uphill struggle for a good education .
while german politicians bemoan the state of affairs , the country 's president horst köhler this week assessed the situation first hand by paying a visit to a school in cologne . one the most damaging conclusions of the latest study is that children from migrant backgrounds are particularly likely to underperform and also fail to integrate properly in society if their parents come from a lower social class and fail to support them adequately . " it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .
around one third of the areas inhabitants are foreigners , half of which are turkish .
only about half of the 270 children who attend the school have german parents . mixed culture school addressing the problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixed culture schools have the added problem of the language barrier .
principal ursula stumpf believes that integration helps the children settle at school and feel comfortable to learn regardless of their economic background .
she has found that a good grasp of the german language is the first step to making children of migrants feel better about themselves and make them ready to learn . " in many families the mother tongue is spoken .
this is okay .
however , the medium of instruction at school is german .
and if the children do not understand what the teacher or their class-mates say , i can imagine that they can get angry because they really want to understand everything . " sponsored language courses bridging the divide the language barrier is something the school is hoping to breach through with extra-curricular language classes .
many parents themselves have a basic grasp of german or little education themselves and therefore can not help their children at home .
and as many come from deprived backgrounds , the school is offering the classes for free after securing financial support from sponsors such as mercator , the european network for regional or minority languages and education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the cologne school are enthusiastic language learners .
" the children want to be integrated into normal school life , ” said language teacher lina wienold .
“ this is because they want to speak like the german children and so the motivation is high . ” mercator chairperson annabel von klenck said : " this project is a big success .
nobody has talked about federalism , nobody has talked about policy .
nobody has talked a lot about money .
enough sponsors have been found .

while german politicians bemoan the state of affairs , the country 's president horst köhler this week assessed the situation first hand by paying a visit to a school in cologne . one the most damaging conclusions of the latest study is that children from migrant backgrounds are particularly likely to underperform and also fail to integrate properly in society if their parents come from a lower social class and fail to support them adequately . " it 's shameful for me that germany - despite knowing that education for us is the key for our children getting jobs and a good future - has such big problems in certain areas of its education system , " köhler said . but , at the same time there are efforts underway to buck the trend and break the vicious cyle of poorer social and economic backgrounds leading to poorer school performance . the tiefentalstrasse school in the cologne suburb of mülheim , which köhler visited , attempts to give migrant children an equal chance .
around one third of the areas inhabitants are foreigners , half of which are turkish .
only about half of the 270 children who attend the school have german parents . mixed culture school addressing the problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mixed culture schools have the added problem of the language barrier .
principal ursula stumpf believes that integration helps the children settle at school and feel comfortable to learn regardless of their economic background .
she has found that a good grasp of the german language is the first step to making children of migrants feel better about themselves and make them ready to learn . " in many families the mother tongue is spoken .
this is okay .
however , the medium of instruction at school is german .
and if the children do not understand what the teacher or their class-mates say , i can imagine that they can get angry because they really want to understand everything . " sponsored language courses bridging the divide the language barrier is something the school is hoping to breach through with extra-curricular language classes .
many parents themselves have a basic grasp of german or little education themselves and therefore can not help their children at home .
and as many come from deprived backgrounds , the school is offering the classes for free after securing financial support from sponsors such as mercator , the european network for regional or minority languages and education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at the cologne school are enthusiastic language learners .
" the children want to be integrated into normal school life , ” said language teacher lina wienold .
“ this is because they want to speak like the german children and so the motivation is high . ” mercator chairperson annabel von klenck said : " this project is a big success .
nobody has talked about federalism , nobody has talked about policy .
nobody has talked a lot about money .
enough sponsors have been found .

the force , the largest in wales , is to issue the 50,000-volt guns to officers who are already trained in firearms .
tasers temporarily disable a suspect with an electric shock delivered by two barbed darts trailing wires .
north wales police was the first welsh force to use them , before gwent police adopted them in august .
the dyfed-powys force is training officers to use them .
the darts fired by a taser gun trail a wire up to 21ft long down which a 50,000-volt electric current is delivered for five seconds .
the electrical current can penetrate clothing up to two inches thick amnesty international claims the guns have been linked to more than 70 deaths in america and canada .
but many senior police officers see the weapons an effective alternative to lethal force for armed officers dealing with a potentially violent suspect .
north wales police was one of the first uk forces to use the weapons on the streets when a man in rhyl was fired at three times in august 2003 .
the man was examined later by a police surgeon for minor injuries but was found to be otherwise fit and well .
south wales police has almost 3,500 officers but said only those trained in using firearms would be allowed to handle taser stun guns .
' baton gun ' a statement said : " the majority of forces in the uk have or are now in the process of deploying them as a less than lethal option where the authorisation of firearms has been granted . "
the force 's operations manager , chief superintendent graham davies , said the stun guns would be " deployed alongside conventional firearms and the baton gun and should not be seen as a replacement for such weapons " .
he said : " taser will provide another less-than-lethal option which will assist in the firearms officer 's assessment and safe resolution of serious incidents without recourse to more lethal force . "

" it 's something we 'd hope they take up and use in whatever shape or form they want to .
" we 're not asking people to become fluent speakers , although that would be nice .
" it 's just about using a bit of manx to identify that they live in the isle of man and they like the isle of man and it is something different .
" differences in the modern globalised word are quite important .
it gives people a sense of identity and i think language is great for that . "

the match comes 100 years after the two sides first met and a capacity crowd is expected at the millennium stadium .
most hotels in the city are fully booked and many have had to employ extra staff to cope with the demand .
police have warned they will crack down on anti-social behaviour by issuing on the spot fines .
first match the wales versus new zealand match is traditionally among the biggest fixtures in world rugby .
wales ' famous 3-0 victory over new zealand in cardiff in 1905 was the all blacks ' only loss on a 35-match tour to the uk , and helped cement rugby union as the national game in both countries .
wales first played new zealand in 1905 , winning 3-0 the match is also noted for helping to establish the tradition of singing national anthems before internationals , after welsh supporters responded to the all blacks ' haka with a spontaneous rendition of hen wlad fy nhadau .
wales have not beaten saturday 's opponents for more than 50 years - a 13-8 victory in 1953 .
with more than 70,000 expected at the millennium stadium and thousands more likely to watch the game in the pubs of cardiff , police said 80 officers would be on duty in the city centre to deter troublemakers .
superintendent martin jones said fans who misbehaved could be given an £ 80 fixed penalty notice .
' visible presence ' mr jones , in charge of policing the city centre , said : " we want to welcome people to cardiff to enjoy the city , the rugby and the family atmosphere .
" there will be a visible police presence in the city -lsb- with -rsb- approximately 80 officers on duty .
" if you choose to misbehave , if you choose to urinate in the street or discard litter and act in an anti social -lsb- way -rsb- you will be dealt with by police officers who will seek to utilise the fixed penalty notice .
" that will include an £ 80 fine .
" early intervention does work and that is what we will be seeking to do on saturday . "
saturday 's match is wales ' first fixture of an autumn series which will see matches against new zealand , fiji , south africa and australia in successive weeks .
chief executive of cardiff 's chamber of commerce russell goodway said the series could pump between £ 6m and £ 8m into the local economy .
" it 's not just buying the ticket it 's the spend in the city - the hotels and the hospitality sector do particularly well out of event days .
" you could get as many as 200,000 people in the city tomorrow afternoon - it 's not just the 75,000 that are here -lrb- in the millennium stadium -rrb- so it 's incredibly important . "

mr hain said among many known terror suspects , some were in south wales .
he has called for a single welsh force to replace the existing four - although a bbc wales poll suggests most people want them to stay as they are .
in an icm poll of 1,000 adults for the dragon 's eye programme , 58 % backed the status quo , and 13 % an all-wales force .
mr hain had said on wednesday that terrorist networks were " active " across south wales , with " the potential to be so in north wales " as well .
on dragon 's eye , he expanded on these comments , to reinforce his argument that the " clear evidence " was that one police force was needed for wales .
i 'm not saying that there is a cell waiting to pounce but there are networks right across britain - hundreds of people involved ... some of them in south wales peter hain he referred to an arrest of a man in cardiff recently , and said : " these people do n't operate in isolation .
" i 'm not saying that there is a cell waiting to pounce but there are networks right across britain - hundreds of people involved that are known to the security service , some of them in south wales .
" that being the case , we need a police force that is up for those challenges .

mr mccartney , 33 , was stabbed to death outside a belfast bar in january .

mr mccartney 's family have campaigned for justice for their murdered brother and claim they have been intimidated by the ira .

catherine mccartney was speaking after refusing to share a platform with margaret thatcher , claiming she had " inflicted injuries " on ireland .
she and sister claire were expected to collect an award along with the former prime minster at a london ceremony .
however , former aide sir bernard ingham criticised the sisters , describing their action as " a grand gesture " .
mr mccartney , 33 , was stabbed to death outside a belfast bar in january .
two men have been charged over his murder .
mr mccartney 's family have campaigned for justice for their murdered brother and claim they have been intimidated by the ira .
lady thatcher was honoured at the awards catherine said the sisters only discovered that baroness thatcher was present when they arrived at the guildhall on thursday .
she said they made an immediate decision not to take part in the awards ceremony .
" our campaign is one of justice and our main focus is our brother robert and the injustice that happened to him and to our family since january , " she told bbc news on friday .
" but in the same way , we can not ignore other injustices that have been carried out and we felt it was n't possible to share a platform with someone we would certainly identify with carrying out injustices in ireland against our own people .
" we were n't aware of who else was receiving awards .
that was part of the protocol of the event - that award winners did not know who else was receiving an award . "
she said the event organisers were well-intentioned and had acted in good faith .
" they were very understanding when we explained our situation and we fully appreciate their support and the recognition that they did give us . "
the family said they would not be used by any group for political means .
sir bernard said baroness thatcher did not need to apologise however , former downing street press officer sir bernard ingham said : " justice is indivisible - you ca n't have justice for one and no justice for other people , " he said .
on the mccartneys ' refusal to accept the award , he believed baroness thatcher " would not grace it with any comment " and had nothing to apologise for over her conduct as prime minister .
members of the mccartney family are expected to travel to washington within the next few weeks to meet senator edward kennedy .

yet the gunpowder plot of 5 november - and the foiling of it - is still celebrated every year .
in york , birthplace of guy fawkes , the most famous of the collaborators , a major programme of events has been lined up to mark the 400th anniversary .
while in sussex , each autumn brings an annual season of spectacular bonfire events as the county celebrates the fact the plot did not succeed .
the gunpowder plot saw guy fawkes and his fellow plotters attempt to blow up mps , peers and king james i at the state opening of parliament .
' absolutely catastrophic ' it is believed the conspirators were angry at what they saw as persecution of roman catholics by the ruling church of england classes .
while bonfire celebrations have been held across the country since , the tradition has been particularly strong in sussex for centuries , with events being staggered across the autumn months to allow all the groups to take part in each other 's festivities . "
it was an ultimate act of terrorism " andrew knowles-baker , battel bonfire boyes saturday - the 400th anniversary of the day parliament would have been blown up - will see two of sussex 's biggest bonfire celebrations take place , at lewes and battle .
battle - the site of the battle of hastings - has staged bonfire celebrations since around the time its abbey was consecrated shortly after king harold was defeated in 1066 .
the event sees 1,066 flaming torches carried through the town , marking the link to the battle .
but andrew knowles-baker , of the battel bonfire boyes , said while some of the annual celebration is focused around events of 1066 , the gunpowder plot is also of huge relevance .
he said : " i think it 's something that should be celebrated , because had it worked and not been foiled by the equivalent of the secret police , the result would have been absolutely catastrophic .
" it was an ultimate act of terrorism - they were blowing up their own people as well as the ones they wanted to remove .
" several hundred people would have been killed and it would have changed the whole face of the monarchy .
" it 's a pretty momentous thing we should mark - and understand why it happened . "
but if the plot is remembered as " an ultimate act of terrorism " , its most famous plotter is looked upon very differently from the vast majority of terrorists . "
he was a man with strong convictions " gillian cruddas , york tourism bureau guy fawkes , who was born in york , was recently included in a list of the 50 greatest people from yorkshire , compiled for a book by sir bernard ingham , margaret thatcher 's former press secretary .
a series of events has been held in york to mark the 400th anniversary , ranging from a major fireworks display to concerts and plays to a guided walk of guy fawkes ' birthplace and haunts .
gillian cruddas , chief executive of the york tourism bureau , said people had been fascinated at being able to find out things such as where guy fawkes was born or where he went to school .
she said : " it 's like all colourful characters , people are fascinated by what they did or what they tried to do .
" with guy fawkes the fact it 's linked to bonfire night has given it a long-lasting quality .
" he was notorious - some people have said he was a 17th century terrorist - but some of the historical facts get diluted and people remember having a good time with bonfire celebrations . "
guy fawkes was tried for high treason and hanged , drawn and quartered on 31 january 1606 .

chapter 27 , which will be shot in new york in january , is being described as a " psychological study " of the former beatle 's killer mark chapman .
lohan , last seen in herbie : fully loaded , will take on a fictional role of a lennon fan who befriends chapman , played by lord of war actor leto .
the parts of lennon and his wife yoko ono have not yet been cast .
lennon was shot dead outside his manhattan home in december 1980 .
chapman , who is still serving a prison sentence for the killing , had got the musician to autograph a copy of his newly released album double fantasy just hours earlier .
first film producers said lennon himself would have a relatively small screen presence in chapter 27 .
lohan 's character was created to help film-makers explore the motivation behind the killing , they added .
the film is the first project from director jarrett schaeffer , who also wrote the script .
it is being co-produced by toronto-based peace arch entertainment and 21 grams film-maker robert salerno 's company artina films .
" it 's a psychological study , " said peace arch 's john flock .
" i would n't call it a sympathetic portrayal of him , but you do kind of get into chapman 's head . "
the film 's title is said to be a reference to the 26 chapters in the jd salinger novel the catcher in the rye , which chapman said was an inspiration for the murder .

mr kyle said us actor and director sam wannamaker had worked for decades to make the theatre a reality .
he said the us director had come over to the uk in the 1940s - acting in a production of shakespeare 's othello - and had become obsessed with finding the site of the original theatre .
mr kyle said wannamaker 's globe theatre project had to overcome many obstacles - many people were opposed to it because they thought it would be " elitist " or " not relevant " .
" he spent the next 40 years of his life convincing people that was n't true . "
the globe , which opened in 1996 , was built over three years using techniques believed to have been used on the original building , mr kyle said .
