program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2005 an expanded union - one year later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks greeted membership a year ago .
is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .
many caregivers , construction workers , craftsmen and farmers see their very existence threatened if eastern european competition is given free reign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as a young farmer , i can say that we are very worried about europe , " said one frenchman . the potential flood of cheap labor and the continued emigration of companies to lower-wage countries in eastern europe has turned the mood sour for more than a few .
that 's reflected in the success of the ' no ' campaign in france regarding that country 's upcoming referendum on the eu constitution . open market as opposed to their continental neighbors , britain is leaving its labor market open .
however , in order to prevent jobs from drifting into black market , people from new eu states have to register with the authorities .
in this way , the government can keep an eye on the labor situation , collect taxes and ensure that minimum wage regulations are being followed . according to jan mokschitzki , president of the polish association in great britain , there are three groups of people seeking work in the uk .
the first group is made up of highly qualified bankers , doctors , and it professionals who are recruited from , for example , poland and lured to britain with limited-term contracts and apartments .
the second are skilled workers with a good knowledge of english , such as plumbers , electricians and locksmiths . " the third , well , that 's the problem group , " he said .
" they are those who hardly speak a word of english , have no money in their pockets and see london as a kind of el dorado where money grows on trees . " they 'll soon be bitterly disappointed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people celebrate poland entering the european union during celebrations at warsaw 's old town midnight saturday may 1 , 2004 , as poland becomes a new eu member , along with nine other countries .
but more than 60 percent of poles are flexible , well-educated and satisfied with eu membership thus far , largely because economic growth in the country has doubled . optimistic looks forward to the south , hungarians would rather work at home or in neighboring austria .
that does n't mean , however , that they have n't found their place in the eu , as has the czech republic , whose former prime minister , vladimir spidla , sees the future positively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , czech republic " i 'm optimistic because the polls show people in the czech republic wants more european integration , " he said .
" they want a common foreign and security policy . " the situation in slovakia next door is somewhat different , in that , since membership a year ago , rent and food prices have skyrocketed .
at the same time , government child support levels have been cut .
but the slovakians chalk that up to rises in domestic taxes rather than to eu membership .
and with corporate tax rates of under 20 percent , many companies from the old eu countries are setting up shop there , which provides slovaks jobs . slovenia , the most developed of the new member states , has long felt itself part of the eu .
its primary goal now is to introduce the euro in 2007 .
but achieve this , it will have to put itself on a strict economic diet and privatize part some government-own assets . the economies in the baltic states - estonia , latvia and lithuania - are booming .
their problems lie in the social sector , with health care and education , where more investment is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. julians sliema , malta malta , with its 400,000 residents , is the smallest eu country .
this mediterranean island was the driving force behind a brussels initiative that put into place new anchoring regulations for tankers . another island member , cyprus , was also involved in the issue .
the average income on cyprus is about 80 percent of the average of the old eu countries and the country 's unemployment rate is under 2.5 percent .
the southern part of the country is booming , but it is not without its problems , primarily of a political nature .
the island remains divided into a greek-cypriot south and a turkish-cypriot north . petra kohnen -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .
-lrb- april 18 , 2005 -rrb- enlarged eu sparks change along borders over 100 days have passed since the eu expanded to take in ten new members , who entered the bloc with a mixture of hope and euphoria on may 1 .
change is perceptible along the new eu borders .

9 , 2004 -rrb- celebrations across eu mark historic enlargement when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .

already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .
and at the very least , barahan said , priests can help people who are under the illusion they 're possessed by getting them psychological help . megan williams -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hunting the devil 's consort a witch hunting craze swept like wildfire through europe from the 15th century to the 18th .

already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .

is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition .

is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .

many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .

it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .

after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "

and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .

police only arrested 65 suspected troublemakers the night before the national holiday .
their policy of de-escalation may be bearing fruit . around 40 people threw bottles and later stones and firecrackers in clashes with the police after a street party in berlin 's friedrichshain neighborhood .
three police officers were lightly injured saturday night , as opposed to more than 50 last year , and a squad car and a tram stop were damaged .
besides 65 arrests , police barred 46 people from taking part in events planned for sunday in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood , where young people for years have gravitated to " do battle " with the police on may day . " given the amount of damage and the number of police injured , it 's clear that there was less trouble than on this night last year - so that the situation could almost be described as peaceful , " said a berlin police spokesman . police attributed the relatively quiet night to the ban on bottles and cans , the actions of police de-escalation teams and illumination of the celebration venues in friedrichshain and prenzlauer berg .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon . the day begins early for harry dauben , usually around 5 a.m. with brisk steps , he makes his way from mailbox to mailbox .
he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .

"
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .

but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .

is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .
many caregivers , construction workers , craftsmen and farmers see their very existence threatened if eastern european competition is given free reign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as a young farmer , i can say that we are very worried about europe , " said one frenchman . the potential flood of cheap labor and the continued emigration of companies to lower-wage countries in eastern europe has turned the mood sour for more than a few .
that 's reflected in the success of the ' no ' campaign in france regarding that country 's upcoming referendum on the eu constitution . open market as opposed to their continental neighbors , britain is leaving its labor market open .
however , in order to prevent jobs from drifting into black market , people from new eu states have to register with the authorities .
in this way , the government can keep an eye on the labor situation , collect taxes and ensure that minimum wage regulations are being followed . according to jan mokschitzki , president of the polish association in great britain , there are three groups of people seeking work in the uk .
the first group is made up of highly qualified bankers , doctors , and it professionals who are recruited from , for example , poland and lured to britain with limited-term contracts and apartments .
the second are skilled workers with a good knowledge of english , such as plumbers , electricians and locksmiths . " the third , well , that 's the problem group , " he said .
" they are those who hardly speak a word of english , have no money in their pockets and see london as a kind of el dorado where money grows on trees . " they 'll soon be bitterly disappointed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people celebrate poland entering the european union during celebrations at warsaw 's old town midnight saturday may 1 , 2004 , as poland becomes a new eu member , along with nine other countries .
but more than 60 percent of poles are flexible , well-educated and satisfied with eu membership thus far , largely because economic growth in the country has doubled . optimistic looks forward to the south , hungarians would rather work at home or in neighboring austria .
that does n't mean , however , that they have n't found their place in the eu , as has the czech republic , whose former prime minister , vladimir spidla , sees the future positively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , czech republic " i 'm optimistic because the polls show people in the czech republic wants more european integration , " he said .
" they want a common foreign and security policy . " the situation in slovakia next door is somewhat different , in that , since membership a year ago , rent and food prices have skyrocketed .
at the same time , government child support levels have been cut .
but the slovakians chalk that up to rises in domestic taxes rather than to eu membership .
and with corporate tax rates of under 20 percent , many companies from the old eu countries are setting up shop there , which provides slovaks jobs . slovenia , the most developed of the new member states , has long felt itself part of the eu .
its primary goal now is to introduce the euro in 2007 .
but achieve this , it will have to put itself on a strict economic diet and privatize part some government-own assets . the economies in the baltic states - estonia , latvia and lithuania - are booming .
their problems lie in the social sector , with health care and education , where more investment is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. julians sliema , malta malta , with its 400,000 residents , is the smallest eu country .
this mediterranean island was the driving force behind a brussels initiative that put into place new anchoring regulations for tankers . another island member , cyprus , was also involved in the issue .
the average income on cyprus is about 80 percent of the average of the old eu countries and the country 's unemployment rate is under 2.5 percent .

police only arrested 65 suspected troublemakers the night before the national holiday .
their policy of de-escalation may be bearing fruit . around 40 people threw bottles and later stones and firecrackers in clashes with the police after a street party in berlin 's friedrichshain neighborhood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2005 an expanded union - one year later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks greeted membership a year ago .
is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .
many caregivers , construction workers , craftsmen and farmers see their very existence threatened if eastern european competition is given free reign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as a young farmer , i can say that we are very worried about europe , " said one frenchman . the potential flood of cheap labor and the continued emigration of companies to lower-wage countries in eastern europe has turned the mood sour for more than a few .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2005 an expanded union - one year later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks greeted membership a year ago .
is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .
many caregivers , construction workers , craftsmen and farmers see their very existence threatened if eastern european competition is given free reign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as a young farmer , i can say that we are very worried about europe , " said one frenchman . the potential flood of cheap labor and the continued emigration of companies to lower-wage countries in eastern europe has turned the mood sour for more than a few .
that 's reflected in the success of the ' no ' campaign in france regarding that country 's upcoming referendum on the eu constitution . open market as opposed to their continental neighbors , britain is leaving its labor market open .
however , in order to prevent jobs from drifting into black market , people from new eu states have to register with the authorities .

their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .
so people , get out your recipes and your ramones . kristof kien -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lyrics crossing borders pop sounds best in english ?

after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .

punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "

and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .

" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon . the day begins early for harry dauben , usually around 5 a.m. with brisk steps , he makes his way from mailbox to mailbox .
he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .
and when the money does n't cover his costs , he works afternoons and evenings delivering pizza - which pays for mileage and food - or he does one-off painting jobs to make ends meet . 50-hour work week dauben is one of those germans who , despite employment , perches on brink of the poverty line . the number of working poor has for years been alarmingly high , according to a recent government study entitled " poverty despite employment . "
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .
they are frequently low-skilled workers , toiling more than 50 hours per week for very low wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting to keep their jobs , whatever the wages jörg hönning sits at his cubicle speaking through a headset in a call center in cologne .
the work is monotonous - a modern assembly line , he says .
but the 32-year-old needs the job . his degree in computer science has n't allowed him to find work in the field .
so he works on the telephone for 6.50 euros per hour , which nets him about 400 euros per month .
that just covers his rent , so he works on the weekends to earn more driving a taxi .
and if he is lucky , he can make another 90 euros this way . earning about 700 to 800 euros , even though he works more than 50 hours per week , hönning buys shoes for a few euros on the internet and jeans with christmas money from his parents .
but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .
" but there is n't really any danger for the highly qualified or specially qualified workers . " that is cold comfort for people like hönning . " i guess that means i will work on every day but my birthday , " he said . christoph scheuermann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gap growing between poor and rich a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .
so people , get out your recipes and your ramones . kristof kien -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lyrics crossing borders pop sounds best in english ?

already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon . the day begins early for harry dauben , usually around 5 a.m. with brisk steps , he makes his way from mailbox to mailbox .
he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .
and when the money does n't cover his costs , he works afternoons and evenings delivering pizza - which pays for mileage and food - or he does one-off painting jobs to make ends meet . 50-hour work week dauben is one of those germans who , despite employment , perches on brink of the poverty line . the number of working poor has for years been alarmingly high , according to a recent government study entitled " poverty despite employment . "
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .
they are frequently low-skilled workers , toiling more than 50 hours per week for very low wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting to keep their jobs , whatever the wages jörg hönning sits at his cubicle speaking through a headset in a call center in cologne .
the work is monotonous - a modern assembly line , he says .
but the 32-year-old needs the job . his degree in computer science has n't allowed him to find work in the field .
so he works on the telephone for 6.50 euros per hour , which nets him about 400 euros per month .
that just covers his rent , so he works on the weekends to earn more driving a taxi .
and if he is lucky , he can make another 90 euros this way . earning about 700 to 800 euros , even though he works more than 50 hours per week , hönning buys shoes for a few euros on the internet and jeans with christmas money from his parents .
but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .
" but there is n't really any danger for the highly qualified or specially qualified workers . " that is cold comfort for people like hönning . " i guess that means i will work on every day but my birthday , " he said . christoph scheuermann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gap growing between poor and rich a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .
so people , get out your recipes and your ramones . kristof kien -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lyrics crossing borders pop sounds best in english ?

already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .
and at the very least , barahan said , priests can help people who are under the illusion they 're possessed by getting them psychological help . megan williams -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hunting the devil 's consort a witch hunting craze swept like wildfire through europe from the 15th century to the 18th .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon . the day begins early for harry dauben , usually around 5 a.m. with brisk steps , he makes his way from mailbox to mailbox .
he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .
and when the money does n't cover his costs , he works afternoons and evenings delivering pizza - which pays for mileage and food - or he does one-off painting jobs to make ends meet . 50-hour work week dauben is one of those germans who , despite employment , perches on brink of the poverty line . the number of working poor has for years been alarmingly high , according to a recent government study entitled " poverty despite employment . "
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .
they are frequently low-skilled workers , toiling more than 50 hours per week for very low wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting to keep their jobs , whatever the wages jörg hönning sits at his cubicle speaking through a headset in a call center in cologne .
the work is monotonous - a modern assembly line , he says .
but the 32-year-old needs the job . his degree in computer science has n't allowed him to find work in the field .
so he works on the telephone for 6.50 euros per hour , which nets him about 400 euros per month .
that just covers his rent , so he works on the weekends to earn more driving a taxi .
and if he is lucky , he can make another 90 euros this way . earning about 700 to 800 euros , even though he works more than 50 hours per week , hönning buys shoes for a few euros on the internet and jeans with christmas money from his parents .
but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .
" but there is n't really any danger for the highly qualified or specially qualified workers . " that is cold comfort for people like hönning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2005 fighting the devil in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the course is not quite as dramatic as hollywood-style exorcism the first college course on exorcism is being offered at a catholic university in italy .
already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .
and at the very least , barahan said , priests can help people who are under the illusion they 're possessed by getting them psychological help . megan williams -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hunting the devil 's consort a witch hunting craze swept like wildfire through europe from the 15th century to the 18th .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .

for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .

the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .
so people , get out your recipes and your ramones . kristof kien -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lyrics crossing borders pop sounds best in english ?

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .

already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .
and at the very least , barahan said , priests can help people who are under the illusion they 're possessed by getting them psychological help . megan williams -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hunting the devil 's consort a witch hunting craze swept like wildfire through europe from the 15th century to the 18th .

these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .

is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .
many caregivers , construction workers , craftsmen and farmers see their very existence threatened if eastern european competition is given free reign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as a young farmer , i can say that we are very worried about europe , " said one frenchman . the potential flood of cheap labor and the continued emigration of companies to lower-wage countries in eastern europe has turned the mood sour for more than a few .
that 's reflected in the success of the ' no ' campaign in france regarding that country 's upcoming referendum on the eu constitution . open market as opposed to their continental neighbors , britain is leaving its labor market open .
however , in order to prevent jobs from drifting into black market , people from new eu states have to register with the authorities .
in this way , the government can keep an eye on the labor situation , collect taxes and ensure that minimum wage regulations are being followed . according to jan mokschitzki , president of the polish association in great britain , there are three groups of people seeking work in the uk .
the first group is made up of highly qualified bankers , doctors , and it professionals who are recruited from , for example , poland and lured to britain with limited-term contracts and apartments .
the second are skilled workers with a good knowledge of english , such as plumbers , electricians and locksmiths . " the third , well , that 's the problem group , " he said .
" they are those who hardly speak a word of english , have no money in their pockets and see london as a kind of el dorado where money grows on trees . " they 'll soon be bitterly disappointed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people celebrate poland entering the european union during celebrations at warsaw 's old town midnight saturday may 1 , 2004 , as poland becomes a new eu member , along with nine other countries .
but more than 60 percent of poles are flexible , well-educated and satisfied with eu membership thus far , largely because economic growth in the country has doubled . optimistic looks forward to the south , hungarians would rather work at home or in neighboring austria .
that does n't mean , however , that they have n't found their place in the eu , as has the czech republic , whose former prime minister , vladimir spidla , sees the future positively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , czech republic " i 'm optimistic because the polls show people in the czech republic wants more european integration , " he said .
" they want a common foreign and security policy . " the situation in slovakia next door is somewhat different , in that , since membership a year ago , rent and food prices have skyrocketed .
at the same time , government child support levels have been cut .
but the slovakians chalk that up to rises in domestic taxes rather than to eu membership .
and with corporate tax rates of under 20 percent , many companies from the old eu countries are setting up shop there , which provides slovaks jobs . slovenia , the most developed of the new member states , has long felt itself part of the eu .
its primary goal now is to introduce the euro in 2007 .
but achieve this , it will have to put itself on a strict economic diet and privatize part some government-own assets . the economies in the baltic states - estonia , latvia and lithuania - are booming .
their problems lie in the social sector , with health care and education , where more investment is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. julians sliema , malta malta , with its 400,000 residents , is the smallest eu country .
this mediterranean island was the driving force behind a brussels initiative that put into place new anchoring regulations for tankers . another island member , cyprus , was also involved in the issue .
the average income on cyprus is about 80 percent of the average of the old eu countries and the country 's unemployment rate is under 2.5 percent .
the southern part of the country is booming , but it is not without its problems , primarily of a political nature .
the island remains divided into a greek-cypriot south and a turkish-cypriot north . petra kohnen -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .
so people , get out your recipes and your ramones . kristof kien -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lyrics crossing borders pop sounds best in english ?

for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .

sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .

" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .
and at the very least , barahan said , priests can help people who are under the illusion they 're possessed by getting them psychological help . megan williams -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hunting the devil 's consort a witch hunting craze swept like wildfire through europe from the 15th century to the 18th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2005 an expanded union - one year later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks greeted membership a year ago .
is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .
many caregivers , construction workers , craftsmen and farmers see their very existence threatened if eastern european competition is given free reign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as a young farmer , i can say that we are very worried about europe , " said one frenchman . the potential flood of cheap labor and the continued emigration of companies to lower-wage countries in eastern europe has turned the mood sour for more than a few .
that 's reflected in the success of the ' no ' campaign in france regarding that country 's upcoming referendum on the eu constitution . open market as opposed to their continental neighbors , britain is leaving its labor market open .
however , in order to prevent jobs from drifting into black market , people from new eu states have to register with the authorities .
in this way , the government can keep an eye on the labor situation , collect taxes and ensure that minimum wage regulations are being followed . according to jan mokschitzki , president of the polish association in great britain , there are three groups of people seeking work in the uk .
the first group is made up of highly qualified bankers , doctors , and it professionals who are recruited from , for example , poland and lured to britain with limited-term contracts and apartments .
the second are skilled workers with a good knowledge of english , such as plumbers , electricians and locksmiths . " the third , well , that 's the problem group , " he said .
" they are those who hardly speak a word of english , have no money in their pockets and see london as a kind of el dorado where money grows on trees . " they 'll soon be bitterly disappointed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people celebrate poland entering the european union during celebrations at warsaw 's old town midnight saturday may 1 , 2004 , as poland becomes a new eu member , along with nine other countries .
but more than 60 percent of poles are flexible , well-educated and satisfied with eu membership thus far , largely because economic growth in the country has doubled . optimistic looks forward to the south , hungarians would rather work at home or in neighboring austria .
that does n't mean , however , that they have n't found their place in the eu , as has the czech republic , whose former prime minister , vladimir spidla , sees the future positively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , czech republic " i 'm optimistic because the polls show people in the czech republic wants more european integration , " he said .
" they want a common foreign and security policy . " the situation in slovakia next door is somewhat different , in that , since membership a year ago , rent and food prices have skyrocketed .
at the same time , government child support levels have been cut .
but the slovakians chalk that up to rises in domestic taxes rather than to eu membership .
and with corporate tax rates of under 20 percent , many companies from the old eu countries are setting up shop there , which provides slovaks jobs . slovenia , the most developed of the new member states , has long felt itself part of the eu .
its primary goal now is to introduce the euro in 2007 .
but achieve this , it will have to put itself on a strict economic diet and privatize part some government-own assets . the economies in the baltic states - estonia , latvia and lithuania - are booming .
their problems lie in the social sector , with health care and education , where more investment is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. julians sliema , malta malta , with its 400,000 residents , is the smallest eu country .
this mediterranean island was the driving force behind a brussels initiative that put into place new anchoring regulations for tankers . another island member , cyprus , was also involved in the issue .
the average income on cyprus is about 80 percent of the average of the old eu countries and the country 's unemployment rate is under 2.5 percent .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon . the day begins early for harry dauben , usually around 5 a.m. with brisk steps , he makes his way from mailbox to mailbox .
he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .
and when the money does n't cover his costs , he works afternoons and evenings delivering pizza - which pays for mileage and food - or he does one-off painting jobs to make ends meet . 50-hour work week dauben is one of those germans who , despite employment , perches on brink of the poverty line . the number of working poor has for years been alarmingly high , according to a recent government study entitled " poverty despite employment . "
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .

so he works on the telephone for 6.50 euros per hour , which nets him about 400 euros per month .

but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .

he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .
and when the money does n't cover his costs , he works afternoons and evenings delivering pizza - which pays for mileage and food - or he does one-off painting jobs to make ends meet . 50-hour work week dauben is one of those germans who , despite employment , perches on brink of the poverty line . the number of working poor has for years been alarmingly high , according to a recent government study entitled " poverty despite employment . "
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .
they are frequently low-skilled workers , toiling more than 50 hours per week for very low wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting to keep their jobs , whatever the wages jörg hönning sits at his cubicle speaking through a headset in a call center in cologne .
the work is monotonous - a modern assembly line , he says .
but the 32-year-old needs the job . his degree in computer science has n't allowed him to find work in the field .
so he works on the telephone for 6.50 euros per hour , which nets him about 400 euros per month .
that just covers his rent , so he works on the weekends to earn more driving a taxi .
and if he is lucky , he can make another 90 euros this way . earning about 700 to 800 euros , even though he works more than 50 hours per week , hönning buys shoes for a few euros on the internet and jeans with christmas money from his parents .
but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .
" but there is n't really any danger for the highly qualified or specially qualified workers . " that is cold comfort for people like hönning . " i guess that means i will work on every day but my birthday , " he said . christoph scheuermann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gap growing between poor and rich a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .

police only arrested 65 suspected troublemakers the night before the national holiday .
their policy of de-escalation may be bearing fruit . around 40 people threw bottles and later stones and firecrackers in clashes with the police after a street party in berlin 's friedrichshain neighborhood .
three police officers were lightly injured saturday night , as opposed to more than 50 last year , and a squad car and a tram stop were damaged .
besides 65 arrests , police barred 46 people from taking part in events planned for sunday in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood , where young people for years have gravitated to " do battle " with the police on may day . " given the amount of damage and the number of police injured , it 's clear that there was less trouble than on this night last year - so that the situation could almost be described as peaceful , " said a berlin police spokesman . police attributed the relatively quiet night to the ban on bottles and cans , the actions of police de-escalation teams and illumination of the celebration venues in friedrichshain and prenzlauer berg .
more than 1,000 police officers were on the job to prevent disturbances . bildunterschrift : sixty-five people were arrested sunday 's challenge but the real test could come sunday evening .
after the " revolutionary may 1 demonstration " - which results in riots every year - was cancelled , organizers told those who looked forward to the event to take part in the " myfest " street party , set for sunday in kreuzberg .
they also announced that a rally would take place at 6 p.m. , which the berlin 's police chief said was an attempt to disrupt the festival . since 1987 , violent clashes between young people and the police have erupted on may day in berlin .
last year , for the first time , the police managed to bring down the numbers of people hurt , although barricades were set on fire , 192 police officers were injured and 186 people arrested . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2005 an expanded union - one year later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks greeted membership a year ago .
is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .
many caregivers , construction workers , craftsmen and farmers see their very existence threatened if eastern european competition is given free reign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as a young farmer , i can say that we are very worried about europe , " said one frenchman . the potential flood of cheap labor and the continued emigration of companies to lower-wage countries in eastern europe has turned the mood sour for more than a few .
that 's reflected in the success of the ' no ' campaign in france regarding that country 's upcoming referendum on the eu constitution . open market as opposed to their continental neighbors , britain is leaving its labor market open .
however , in order to prevent jobs from drifting into black market , people from new eu states have to register with the authorities .
in this way , the government can keep an eye on the labor situation , collect taxes and ensure that minimum wage regulations are being followed . according to jan mokschitzki , president of the polish association in great britain , there are three groups of people seeking work in the uk .
the first group is made up of highly qualified bankers , doctors , and it professionals who are recruited from , for example , poland and lured to britain with limited-term contracts and apartments .
the second are skilled workers with a good knowledge of english , such as plumbers , electricians and locksmiths . " the third , well , that 's the problem group , " he said .
" they are those who hardly speak a word of english , have no money in their pockets and see london as a kind of el dorado where money grows on trees . " they 'll soon be bitterly disappointed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people celebrate poland entering the european union during celebrations at warsaw 's old town midnight saturday may 1 , 2004 , as poland becomes a new eu member , along with nine other countries .
but more than 60 percent of poles are flexible , well-educated and satisfied with eu membership thus far , largely because economic growth in the country has doubled . optimistic looks forward to the south , hungarians would rather work at home or in neighboring austria .
that does n't mean , however , that they have n't found their place in the eu , as has the czech republic , whose former prime minister , vladimir spidla , sees the future positively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , czech republic " i 'm optimistic because the polls show people in the czech republic wants more european integration , " he said .
" they want a common foreign and security policy . " the situation in slovakia next door is somewhat different , in that , since membership a year ago , rent and food prices have skyrocketed .
at the same time , government child support levels have been cut .
but the slovakians chalk that up to rises in domestic taxes rather than to eu membership .
and with corporate tax rates of under 20 percent , many companies from the old eu countries are setting up shop there , which provides slovaks jobs . slovenia , the most developed of the new member states , has long felt itself part of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2005 fighting the devil in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the course is not quite as dramatic as hollywood-style exorcism the first college course on exorcism is being offered at a catholic university in italy .
already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .
and at the very least , barahan said , priests can help people who are under the illusion they 're possessed by getting them psychological help . megan williams -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hunting the devil 's consort a witch hunting craze swept like wildfire through europe from the 15th century to the 18th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.05.2005 an expanded union - one year later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fireworks greeted membership a year ago .
is the mood still jubilant ?
one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .
they were now eu citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but those newcomers in this " eu of 25 " have experienced their first year of membership in very different ways .
according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .
many caregivers , construction workers , craftsmen and farmers see their very existence threatened if eastern european competition is given free reign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " as a young farmer , i can say that we are very worried about europe , " said one frenchman . the potential flood of cheap labor and the continued emigration of companies to lower-wage countries in eastern europe has turned the mood sour for more than a few .
that 's reflected in the success of the ' no ' campaign in france regarding that country 's upcoming referendum on the eu constitution . open market as opposed to their continental neighbors , britain is leaving its labor market open .
however , in order to prevent jobs from drifting into black market , people from new eu states have to register with the authorities .
in this way , the government can keep an eye on the labor situation , collect taxes and ensure that minimum wage regulations are being followed . according to jan mokschitzki , president of the polish association in great britain , there are three groups of people seeking work in the uk .
the first group is made up of highly qualified bankers , doctors , and it professionals who are recruited from , for example , poland and lured to britain with limited-term contracts and apartments .
the second are skilled workers with a good knowledge of english , such as plumbers , electricians and locksmiths . " the third , well , that 's the problem group , " he said .
" they are those who hardly speak a word of english , have no money in their pockets and see london as a kind of el dorado where money grows on trees . " they 'll soon be bitterly disappointed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people celebrate poland entering the european union during celebrations at warsaw 's old town midnight saturday may 1 , 2004 , as poland becomes a new eu member , along with nine other countries .
but more than 60 percent of poles are flexible , well-educated and satisfied with eu membership thus far , largely because economic growth in the country has doubled . optimistic looks forward to the south , hungarians would rather work at home or in neighboring austria .
that does n't mean , however , that they have n't found their place in the eu , as has the czech republic , whose former prime minister , vladimir spidla , sees the future positively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague , czech republic " i 'm optimistic because the polls show people in the czech republic wants more european integration , " he said .
" they want a common foreign and security policy . " the situation in slovakia next door is somewhat different , in that , since membership a year ago , rent and food prices have skyrocketed .
at the same time , government child support levels have been cut .
but the slovakians chalk that up to rises in domestic taxes rather than to eu membership .
and with corporate tax rates of under 20 percent , many companies from the old eu countries are setting up shop there , which provides slovaks jobs . slovenia , the most developed of the new member states , has long felt itself part of the eu .
its primary goal now is to introduce the euro in 2007 .
but achieve this , it will have to put itself on a strict economic diet and privatize part some government-own assets . the economies in the baltic states - estonia , latvia and lithuania - are booming .
their problems lie in the social sector , with health care and education , where more investment is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. julians sliema , malta malta , with its 400,000 residents , is the smallest eu country .
this mediterranean island was the driving force behind a brussels initiative that put into place new anchoring regulations for tankers . another island member , cyprus , was also involved in the issue .
the average income on cyprus is about 80 percent of the average of the old eu countries and the country 's unemployment rate is under 2.5 percent .
the southern part of the country is booming , but it is not without its problems , primarily of a political nature .
the island remains divided into a greek-cypriot south and a turkish-cypriot north . petra kohnen -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .
so people , get out your recipes and your ramones . kristof kien -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lyrics crossing borders pop sounds best in english ?

they are frequently low-skilled workers , toiling more than 50 hours per week for very low wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting to keep their jobs , whatever the wages jörg hönning sits at his cubicle speaking through a headset in a call center in cologne .
the work is monotonous - a modern assembly line , he says .
but the 32-year-old needs the job . his degree in computer science has n't allowed him to find work in the field .
so he works on the telephone for 6.50 euros per hour , which nets him about 400 euros per month .
that just covers his rent , so he works on the weekends to earn more driving a taxi .
and if he is lucky , he can make another 90 euros this way . earning about 700 to 800 euros , even though he works more than 50 hours per week , hönning buys shoes for a few euros on the internet and jeans with christmas money from his parents .
but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .
" but there is n't really any danger for the highly qualified or specially qualified workers . " that is cold comfort for people like hönning . " i guess that means i will work on every day but my birthday , " he said . christoph scheuermann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gap growing between poor and rich a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2005 fighting the devil in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the course is not quite as dramatic as hollywood-style exorcism the first college course on exorcism is being offered at a catholic university in italy .
already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .
and at the very least , barahan said , priests can help people who are under the illusion they 're possessed by getting them psychological help . megan williams -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hunting the devil 's consort a witch hunting craze swept like wildfire through europe from the 15th century to the 18th .

police only arrested 65 suspected troublemakers the night before the national holiday .
their policy of de-escalation may be bearing fruit . around 40 people threw bottles and later stones and firecrackers in clashes with the police after a street party in berlin 's friedrichshain neighborhood .
three police officers were lightly injured saturday night , as opposed to more than 50 last year , and a squad car and a tram stop were damaged .
besides 65 arrests , police barred 46 people from taking part in events planned for sunday in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood , where young people for years have gravitated to " do battle " with the police on may day . " given the amount of damage and the number of police injured , it 's clear that there was less trouble than on this night last year - so that the situation could almost be described as peaceful , " said a berlin police spokesman . police attributed the relatively quiet night to the ban on bottles and cans , the actions of police de-escalation teams and illumination of the celebration venues in friedrichshain and prenzlauer berg .
more than 1,000 police officers were on the job to prevent disturbances . bildunterschrift : sixty-five people were arrested sunday 's challenge but the real test could come sunday evening .
after the " revolutionary may 1 demonstration " - which results in riots every year - was cancelled , organizers told those who looked forward to the event to take part in the " myfest " street party , set for sunday in kreuzberg .
they also announced that a rally would take place at 6 p.m. , which the berlin 's police chief said was an attempt to disrupt the festival . since 1987 , violent clashes between young people and the police have erupted on may day in berlin .
last year , for the first time , the police managed to bring down the numbers of people hurt , although barricades were set on fire , 192 police officers were injured and 186 people arrested . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon . the day begins early for harry dauben , usually around 5 a.m. with brisk steps , he makes his way from mailbox to mailbox .
he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .
and when the money does n't cover his costs , he works afternoons and evenings delivering pizza - which pays for mileage and food - or he does one-off painting jobs to make ends meet . 50-hour work week dauben is one of those germans who , despite employment , perches on brink of the poverty line . the number of working poor has for years been alarmingly high , according to a recent government study entitled " poverty despite employment . "
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .
they are frequently low-skilled workers , toiling more than 50 hours per week for very low wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting to keep their jobs , whatever the wages jörg hönning sits at his cubicle speaking through a headset in a call center in cologne .
the work is monotonous - a modern assembly line , he says .
but the 32-year-old needs the job . his degree in computer science has n't allowed him to find work in the field .
so he works on the telephone for 6.50 euros per hour , which nets him about 400 euros per month .
that just covers his rent , so he works on the weekends to earn more driving a taxi .
and if he is lucky , he can make another 90 euros this way . earning about 700 to 800 euros , even though he works more than 50 hours per week , hönning buys shoes for a few euros on the internet and jeans with christmas money from his parents .
but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .
" but there is n't really any danger for the highly qualified or specially qualified workers . " that is cold comfort for people like hönning .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon . the day begins early for harry dauben , usually around 5 a.m. with brisk steps , he makes his way from mailbox to mailbox .
he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .
and when the money does n't cover his costs , he works afternoons and evenings delivering pizza - which pays for mileage and food - or he does one-off painting jobs to make ends meet . 50-hour work week dauben is one of those germans who , despite employment , perches on brink of the poverty line . the number of working poor has for years been alarmingly high , according to a recent government study entitled " poverty despite employment . "
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .
they are frequently low-skilled workers , toiling more than 50 hours per week for very low wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting to keep their jobs , whatever the wages jörg hönning sits at his cubicle speaking through a headset in a call center in cologne .
the work is monotonous - a modern assembly line , he says .
but the 32-year-old needs the job . his degree in computer science has n't allowed him to find work in the field .
so he works on the telephone for 6.50 euros per hour , which nets him about 400 euros per month .
that just covers his rent , so he works on the weekends to earn more driving a taxi .
and if he is lucky , he can make another 90 euros this way . earning about 700 to 800 euros , even though he works more than 50 hours per week , hönning buys shoes for a few euros on the internet and jeans with christmas money from his parents .
but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .
" but there is n't really any danger for the highly qualified or specially qualified workers . " that is cold comfort for people like hönning . " i guess that means i will work on every day but my birthday , " he said . christoph scheuermann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gap growing between poor and rich a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.05.2005 cooking to the beat of a different drummer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is that what you 're making for dinner tonight ?
some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .
so people , get out your recipes and your ramones . kristof kien -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lyrics crossing borders pop sounds best in english ?

some cooks saute to samba , others julienne to classical .
but now some are discovering the joys of folding and pouring to the pulsing beats of punk . ever try " revolutionary coconut curry ? "
or maybe " vegan punk-rock pancakes " or " rebecca ’ s spaghetti from hell ? "
these are some of the delicacies a veteran punk rocker has put together in cookbook , served with a serving of politics and instructions on musical accompaniment . the trend started decades ago , because after all , even punks need to eat .
" i think it started back in the 80s , when english and american punk rock became aware that there is more than just music , " said joachim hiller , author of three punk-rock cookbooks and editor of punk rock magazine ox .
" and people started cooking , basically in squads they started what we call volksküche , or ' people ’ s kitchen . '
they started to cook for the whole house , invite homeless people , invite people that go to shows , etc . "
pass on the foie gras , please just like punk rock , which mainly consists of only three chords on the guitar , punk-rock cooking is pretty easy as well , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no foie gras for punks , please " it ’ s about keeping it simple in a way , and making sure it ’ s not too fancy , " he said .
" i don ’ t like this french attitude that everything has to be very intricate .
usually , the simple recipes that are based on farmer ’ s recipes are the best ones .
these are the ones that are so simple that everyone can make them . "
the other thing that makes punk-rock cuisine a bit different is the fact that punks are not what you call meat lovers .
many punks think it is healthier to stay away from meat and that it is n't right to kill animals .
attitude , man for the punk rock scene , cooking seems to be more than just putting a meal together : it ’ s also about eating consciously and about buying the right ingredients at the right places .
that is why vegetarianism fits in well .
" vegetarianism is basically the key to punk-rock cooking , because of the whole aspect of the exploitation of the so-called third world countries through western corporations like mcdonalds for meat production , " he said .
" also punk rockers have always been very critical about consumption .
i mean , coming from that background , there is certain awareness of where to shop .
it goes into the direction of health food . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic food stores are the place to go to shop for punk cuisine it ’ s this attitude that makes punk-rock cooking different from other cooking styles .
the actual punk-rock recipes are not all that special compared to any other recipes , hiller said .
after all , spaghetti is spaghetti - there is no such thing as a punk-rock spaghetti .
but it ’ s the cook ’ s attitude that makes the difference .
punks have always seen themselves as rebels against the establishment .
and joachim believes that with this attitude towards cooking they can actually change something - even politically .
" once every four or five years you can vote , " he said .
" how much does that change ?
but how much does it change if you can decide for yourself ‘ who do i want to give my money to ? ’
and if you take your money to a health-food store , where the money goes to a farmer that produces organic products , in contrast to turbo-cow-milk from some factory , that really makes a difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right food , with the right musical accompaniment , like the ramones .
and of course there is the music : in hiller ’ s cook books , each recipe also recommends a song to play while making the food and eating it .
so , for example , if you want to make rice-and-cheese pancakes , you should listen to band " the hives " to make it a real punk-rock cooking highlight .
so people , get out your recipes and your ramones . kristof kien -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german lyrics crossing borders pop sounds best in english ?

already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon . the day begins early for harry dauben , usually around 5 a.m. with brisk steps , he makes his way from mailbox to mailbox .
he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .
and when the money does n't cover his costs , he works afternoons and evenings delivering pizza - which pays for mileage and food - or he does one-off painting jobs to make ends meet . 50-hour work week dauben is one of those germans who , despite employment , perches on brink of the poverty line . the number of working poor has for years been alarmingly high , according to a recent government study entitled " poverty despite employment . "
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .
they are frequently low-skilled workers , toiling more than 50 hours per week for very low wages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting to keep their jobs , whatever the wages jörg hönning sits at his cubicle speaking through a headset in a call center in cologne .
the work is monotonous - a modern assembly line , he says .
but the 32-year-old needs the job . his degree in computer science has n't allowed him to find work in the field .
so he works on the telephone for 6.50 euros per hour , which nets him about 400 euros per month .
that just covers his rent , so he works on the weekends to earn more driving a taxi .
and if he is lucky , he can make another 90 euros this way . earning about 700 to 800 euros , even though he works more than 50 hours per week , hönning buys shoes for a few euros on the internet and jeans with christmas money from his parents .
but to the government , cases like his should n't exist . " with full-time employment , one should be able to earn enough to put oneself above the poverty line , and guarantee a decent standard of living , " according to the report . but those words mean little to hönning . " the question is what one requires , " he said .
" i have scaled down my needs .
at this point , i need money for food , and rent . " keep wages low , economists say the question is : what next ?
these days , the pressure is on to keep wages down .
economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .
" but there is n't really any danger for the highly qualified or specially qualified workers . " that is cold comfort for people like hönning . " i guess that means i will work on every day but my birthday , " he said . christoph scheuermann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gap growing between poor and rich a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it .

already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .

police only arrested 65 suspected troublemakers the night before the national holiday .
their policy of de-escalation may be bearing fruit . around 40 people threw bottles and later stones and firecrackers in clashes with the police after a street party in berlin 's friedrichshain neighborhood .
three police officers were lightly injured saturday night , as opposed to more than 50 last year , and a squad car and a tram stop were damaged .
besides 65 arrests , police barred 46 people from taking part in events planned for sunday in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood , where young people for years have gravitated to " do battle " with the police on may day . " given the amount of damage and the number of police injured , it 's clear that there was less trouble than on this night last year - so that the situation could almost be described as peaceful , " said a berlin police spokesman . police attributed the relatively quiet night to the ban on bottles and cans , the actions of police de-escalation teams and illumination of the celebration venues in friedrichshain and prenzlauer berg .
more than 1,000 police officers were on the job to prevent disturbances . bildunterschrift : sixty-five people were arrested sunday 's challenge but the real test could come sunday evening .
after the " revolutionary may 1 demonstration " - which results in riots every year - was cancelled , organizers told those who looked forward to the event to take part in the " myfest " street party , set for sunday in kreuzberg .
they also announced that a rally would take place at 6 p.m. , which the berlin 's police chief said was an attempt to disrupt the festival . since 1987 , violent clashes between young people and the police have erupted on may day in berlin .
last year , for the first time , the police managed to bring down the numbers of people hurt , although barricades were set on fire , 192 police officers were injured and 186 people arrested . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .

" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .

" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .

" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .

already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "
for the dozens of priests who are following the exorcism course in rome , that percentage is enough to study exorcism .
and at the very least , barahan said , priests can help people who are under the illusion they 're possessed by getting them psychological help . megan williams -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hunting the devil 's consort a witch hunting craze swept like wildfire through europe from the 15th century to the 18th .

police only arrested 65 suspected troublemakers the night before the national holiday .
their policy of de-escalation may be bearing fruit . around 40 people threw bottles and later stones and firecrackers in clashes with the police after a street party in berlin 's friedrichshain neighborhood .
three police officers were lightly injured saturday night , as opposed to more than 50 last year , and a squad car and a tram stop were damaged .
besides 65 arrests , police barred 46 people from taking part in events planned for sunday in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood , where young people for years have gravitated to " do battle " with the police on may day . " given the amount of damage and the number of police injured , it 's clear that there was less trouble than on this night last year - so that the situation could almost be described as peaceful , " said a berlin police spokesman . police attributed the relatively quiet night to the ban on bottles and cans , the actions of police de-escalation teams and illumination of the celebration venues in friedrichshain and prenzlauer berg .
more than 1,000 police officers were on the job to prevent disturbances . bildunterschrift : sixty-five people were arrested sunday 's challenge but the real test could come sunday evening .
after the " revolutionary may 1 demonstration " - which results in riots every year - was cancelled , organizers told those who looked forward to the event to take part in the " myfest " street party , set for sunday in kreuzberg .
they also announced that a rally would take place at 6 p.m. , which the berlin 's police chief said was an attempt to disrupt the festival . since 1987 , violent clashes between young people and the police have erupted on may day in berlin .
last year , for the first time , the police managed to bring down the numbers of people hurt , although barricades were set on fire , 192 police officers were injured and 186 people arrested . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for may day protests as berlin braces itself for annual may day protests and violence , authorities are sending out a clear message to potential rioters - 8,000 police officers with orders to crack down swiftly on troublemakers .

economists such as hilmar schneider from the bonn institute for the future of employment say that additional employment costs need to be kept down for the further development of low-wage sectors .
and competition within these sectors should be expanded " what we have to care for is to make sure to make basic work attractive again , " schneider said .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon . the day begins early for harry dauben , usually around 5 a.m. with brisk steps , he makes his way from mailbox to mailbox .
he is delivering the cologne newspapers , just as he does each morning , six days a week , rain or shine .
today , he has to also deliver a portion of his sick colleague 's route and he is already sweating . " i get enough exercise , " he pants . he has to hurry - because all of the 240 papers have to be distributed within 90 minutes .
and after , he will drive his rickety toyota to his next job , dispatching letters for a private delivery firm . he earns 950 euros -lrb- $ 1,220 -rrb- each month , with which he pays rent , gasoline and child support for his two sons .
and when the money does n't cover his costs , he works afternoons and evenings delivering pizza - which pays for mileage and food - or he does one-off painting jobs to make ends meet . 50-hour work week dauben is one of those germans who , despite employment , perches on brink of the poverty line . the number of working poor has for years been alarmingly high , according to a recent government study entitled " poverty despite employment . "
more than one million full-time workers in germany earn less than half the average national income .
these people usually have two or three jobs at the same time .

according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .

however , in order to prevent jobs from drifting into black market , people from new eu states have to register with the authorities .
in this way , the government can keep an eye on the labor situation , collect taxes and ensure that minimum wage regulations are being followed . according to jan mokschitzki , president of the polish association in great britain , there are three groups of people seeking work in the uk .
the first group is made up of highly qualified bankers , doctors , and it professionals who are recruited from , for example , poland and lured to britain with limited-term contracts and apartments .
the second are skilled workers with a good knowledge of english , such as plumbers , electricians and locksmiths . " the third , well , that 's the problem group , " he said .

at the same time , government child support levels have been cut .

one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .

according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .

the first group is made up of highly qualified bankers , doctors , and it professionals who are recruited from , for example , poland and lured to britain with limited-term contracts and apartments .
the second are skilled workers with a good knowledge of english , such as plumbers , electricians and locksmiths . " the third , well , that 's the problem group , " he said .

one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .
what has membership meant , in real terms , for the new member states and their citizens ? on may 1 , 2004 , estonians , lithuanians , latvians , poles , slovenians , slovakians , czechs , hungarians , maltese and cypriots woke up to a new flag flying alongside their national colors - the yellow circle of stars on a blue background .

according to recent surveys , the report card from the first year is pretty positive .
their economies are growing ; eu monies are flowing ; new travels freedoms are being taken advantage of ; and among young people , educational exchanges are booming . low-wage worries however , people in the older eu countries are somewhat less reserved about the expansion .
many western europeans are worried , since they feel their jobs could be in danger if cheap labor from the new member states puts strong downward pressure on wages or simply deprives western europeans of work . because of this , swedish economics minister thomas östros is against the eu commission 's planned services deregulation directive meant to throw open businesses to cross-border competition . " our strategy is to discuss every aspect of the directive and find a solution that would protect against wage dumping but enable free trade , " he said .
" if we do n't achieve that , we want to put through some changes , as germany does . " until wage levels across the eu have become more harmonized , germany and france have said that in order to prevent wages from falling to a few euros per hour , transition regulations are important .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2005 fighting the devil in rome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the course is not quite as dramatic as hollywood-style exorcism the first college course on exorcism is being offered at a catholic university in italy .
already , priests from around the world are flocking to rome to participate and study psychology , law and a history of satanism . the university on the outskirts of rome is about as far from hogwarts as it gets .
sunshine streams in from a huge skylight above as a janitor pushes a broom across a slick , shiny floor and students mill about with coffee before making their way to class - in black cassocks and dangling crosses .
because beneath its modern veneer , the vatican-backed regina apostolorum pontifical university , or upra , is grappling with demons .
for the first time , this conservative catholic university is offering exorcism 101 this year .
" people are experiencing these things more for various reasons , but they are starting more and more to come to the priest and say i need some help , " said father christopher barrack , a priest from lincoln , neb . , who was sent to rome by his bishop specifically to take the 8-week exorcism course . forget rosaries and bibles in one room , father piedro barahan is giving a lecture to a class of 80 students - almost all men .
forget bibles and rosaries .
with the aid of his laptop computer and a microphone , barahan gives a power-point presentation on the theology of demons .
another 50 or so students follow the lecture through videoconference links with three other italian cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the influence ?
" most of these people here are priests and most of them in their pastoral work deal with people who feel that they have a problem of possession and they do n't know whether it 's really supernatural or psychological , " he said .
" i think they want criteria with which they can distinguish if it 's really the supernatural action of the devil or a psychological sickness . "
the devil you know barahan is an expert on demons and satanic worship .
it 's an especially hot topic these days in italy .
a sensational murder case involving teenagers who practiced demonic worship and satanic rituals has got the country worried about the spread of such cults , especially among young people .
one catholic sociologist who was a guest lecturer here claims these cults are on the rise , with up to 100,000 young people involved .
there 's no proof to back up the claim , but the alarm is real .
and if this crowded classroom is anything to go by , there 's certainly interest in exorcism and the devil among catholic priests . like many catholics , barahan is convinced that the devil is a real , very powerful entity and not simply a symbolic representation of evil .
he 's assisted in numerous exorcisms and says he 's learned to tell when someone is truly possessed as opposed to mentally ill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against satan ?
" this is not so easy , but we have signs , " barahan said .
" for example , the aversion against religious objects - a cross or a rosary or blessed water .
sometimes these people have a lot of strength , not natural strength , against these kinds of signs .
sometimes they speak languages without having studied them before .
sometimes they know the future of other people .
so there 's not one sign , but several signs , especially , psychologically .
you have a lot of instability as if you have two souls in one body . "
barrack explains he is n't an exorcist himself - only priests appointed by their bishop can conduct exorcisms - but he said his parishioners back home do come to him for help with a range of battles against evil : anything from special prayers against temptation to protection against strange noises in their homes .
but , he cautions , it does n't mean the devil has taken them over .
" certainly there could be a lot of temptation and oppression from the devil on a person , " he said .
" that does not mean possession .
possession is when a devil actually takes control of the person and the person does not have its own free will , so the devil is using the person to speak and act without the person freely consenting to that .
that would be possession . "
barrack also said he believes that the devil is behind some of the new age and other alternative spirituality groups .
even parents can be involved .
" i 've noticed , from some people they 've said maybe one of their parents dedicated them to satan when they were born , " he said .
" there are many satanic cults or gnostic groups , some that are well-respected in society , but behind the scenes there is this connection with satan . " no witch hunts , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ridding capitol hill of demons ?
but not all priests are so convinced .
father gerry o 'collins is a renowned theologian at the gregorian university in downtown rome .
he says there 's a real danger in catholics focusing too much on demons .
he cites the witch hunts of the 16th century as an example of how people can get carried away .
" there 's definitely a risk of people seeing the devil 's hand all over the place and being superstitious , " he said .
" you can become caught up by that and even obsessed by it .
and certainly official church leaders do n't want freelance priests and others to play games .
they want a wise old priest who 's the official exorcist and who 's skeptical and who knows what he 's about and i think that 's a happy situation . "
o 'collins does believe that possessions can happen , but of all the people claiming to be possessed , most catholic theologians estimated only a tiny number is the real thing .
" yes , it can happen , but it 's extremely rare , " collins said .
" maybe 2 percent of the cases you should take seriously . "

the lord of the rings actor and oscar nominee proves some of the uk 's biggest stars can not resist the lure of the rovers return and rita 's kabin .
playing dubious author mel hutchwright , sir ian said the role would fulfil a " long-held ambition " .
he is the latest in a long line of stellar names who have coveted parts in britain 's most popular soap .
legendary actor sir laurence olivier once asked for a part and a role was written for him - but he was too ill to appear .
fellow thespians sir derek jacobi and sir anthony hopkins have also asked their agents to put in a word - but have not yet had the chance to take part .
sir derek once said the characters " always make me cry " .
" considering they do it week after week , the standard is phenomenal , " he said .
" and they make it look so easy , that 's their great gift . "
and sir anthony said : " life is n't worth living if i miss an episode " .
famous faces to have graced the street include actors sir norman wisdom , honor blackman and maureen lipman plus comic peter kay and singer sir cliff richard and even the prince of wales .
kay cropped up as shelly unwin 's mismatched date in 2004 sporting a ghastly ginger wig , seven years after his first appearance .
the phoenix nights creator said he had " always been a huge fan " and had " been brought up with it all my life " .
lipman made a sudden arrival behind the rovers bar in 2002 while ex-bond girl blackman played a flirty pensioner who swept norris off his feet .
sir cliff , actor michael crawford and former manchester united goalkeeper peter schmeichel have also been spotted in the background .
and the prince of wales was seen in the 40th anniversary episode being shown around town by mayoress audrey roberts .
inside soap editor steven murphy said doing a cameo was " great fun " and gave those involved " a different kind of kudos " .
" they do n't do it to further their careers - but many of them have a deep fondness for coronation street , they were brought up on it , " he says .
celebrity casting can sometimes misfire , he adds , citing the plot last year featuring sir norman as an elderly fitness fanatic .
" the norman wisdom comedy storyline seemed tacked on and did n't work , " mr murphy says .
" soaps are supposed to be the closest thing we get to real life and a famous face can take away our belief in the programme . "
coronation street producers are wary of being accused of " stunt " casting .
the arrival of sir ian took more than a year to plan , they say .
fertile ground coronation street spokeswoman alison sinclair says : " it is n't something where we say ' who 's available ?
who can we get in next ? '
" the part of mel hutchwright was created before we knew sir ian mckellen was available - but when the part was created , it was clear sir ian would be ideal .
" you can not create characters that will develop because well-known , established stars are very busy , that 's the nature of the beast .
this kind of role has to have a beginning , middle and end . "
coronation street has attracted more star cameos in recent years than its rivals .
emmerdale has made do with the spice girls ' mel b , wet wet wet star marti pellow and hunter from gladiators .
career move singer robbie williams has been spotted drinking in eastenders , which was also the soap of choice for little britain comedian david walliams .
the rule of celebrity cameos is the star does it for fun - not to revive their career .
but some stars take on a soap role as a career move .
barbara windsor , shane richie , ian lavender and martin kemp were all familiar names when they joined eastenders .
and some big names owe part of their success to early soap exposure .
sir ben kingsley , patrick stewart , joanna lumley and prunella scales all started out with minor parts in coronation street before becoming household names .
sir ian mckellen is doing it the other way around - he once turned down a role as elsie tanner 's nephew because he was intimidated by the regular coronation street cast .

peter kay played shelly 's date kay cropped up as shelly unwin 's mismatched date in 2004 sporting a ghastly ginger wig , seven years after his first appearance .
the phoenix nights creator said he had " always been a huge fan " and had " been brought up with it all my life " .

barbara windsor was already a star when she joined eastenders inside soap editor steven murphy said doing a cameo was " great fun " and gave those involved " a different kind of kudos " .
" they do n't do it to further their careers - but many of them have a deep fondness for coronation street , they were brought up on it , " he says .
celebrity casting can sometimes misfire , he adds , citing the plot last year featuring sir norman as an elderly fitness fanatic .
" the norman wisdom comedy storyline seemed tacked on and did n't work , " mr murphy says .
" soaps are supposed to be the closest thing we get to real life and a famous face can take away our belief in the programme . "
coronation street producers are wary of being accused of " stunt " casting .

emmerdale has made do with the spice girls ' mel b , wet wet wet star marti pellow and hunter from gladiators .

barbara windsor , shane richie , ian lavender and martin kemp were all familiar names when they joined eastenders .
and some big names owe part of their success to early soap exposure .
sir ben kingsley , patrick stewart , joanna lumley and prunella scales all started out with minor parts in coronation street before becoming household names .
sir ian mckellen is doing it the other way around - he once turned down a role as elsie tanner 's nephew because he was intimidated by the regular coronation street cast .

the call comes as taiwanese opposition leader , lien chan , continues a visit to china , where he has held historic talks with president hu jintao .
mr chen said beijing had to talk to the leader chosen by the people of taiwan , and he was sending a personal message to mr hu through an envoy .
mr lien heads the kmt , who were driven out by the communists in 1949 .
the leader of the smaller opposition people first party , james soong , is also due in the mainland for talks this week .
president chen has asked him to take his undisclosed message to leaders in beijing .
the taiwanese president favours formal independence from china , whereas beijing regards taiwan as a renegade province . "
regardless which political party or leader china wants to meet , eventually it must talk with taiwan 's popularly elected leader " president chen shui-bian the nationalist kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- has previously said it favours eventual reunification , so long as china is by then democratic .
the people first party also favours taiwan 's eventual unification with mainland china .
beijing 's strategy has been to reach out to taiwan 's opposition politicians , in a bid to isolate mr chen and force him to moderate his pro-independence stance , says the bbc 's louisa lim in beijing .
but big obstacles still remain to cross-straits ties , our correspondent says .
china refuses to talk to mr chen until he signs up to their one-china policy - something which would be political anathema for him , she says .
happy momentum lien chan has been feted by massive crowds as he continues his trip to china .
thousands turned up to greet him as he paid his respects at his grandmothers ' graveside in xian , where he was born before world war ii .
the crowds in xian waved the flags of both communist china and the nationalist kuomintang party which fled to taiwan in defeat in 1949 .
taiwan-china relations ruled by separate governments since end of chinese civil war in 1949 china considers the island part of its territory china has offered a " one country , two systems " solution , like hong kong most people in taiwan support status quo text of kmt-beijing agreement " to come here today is very moving , " mr lien said .
mr lien is being treated like a head of state , with lavish receptions everywhere he goes , a sign that beijing 's happy with the momentum created by his visit , our beijing correspondent says .
but president chen said : " regardless which political party or leader china wants to meet , eventually it must talk with taiwan 's popularly elected leader and the taiwan government , and this will be the normal dialogue to start normalization of relations . "
mr lien and his family moved to taiwan in 1946 , while the civil war was still raging .
the next stop on his mainland tour will be shanghai , which has seen large-scale taiwanese investment .
