lehne currently serves as director for southeastern europe in the secretariat of the eu council and is a senior advisor to eu foreign policy chief javier solana . un-sponsored talks on the future status of kosovo , the breakaway serbian province that has been administered by the united nations and nato since its 1998-1999 war , are expected to begin later this month . ethnic albanians , who outnumber serbs and other minorities in kosovo by more than nine-to-one , want full independence from serbia , while belgrade says it is prepared to offer pristina " more than autonomy but less than independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un kosovo envoy martti ahtisaari has received full backing from the eu lehne 's role will be to support the former finnish president and un envoy to kosovo martti ahtisaari in helping the two sides reach a compromise .
and while the outcome of the talks can not be predicted , the eu has been signaling that a parallel eu-integration of kosovo and serbia could be a way of appeasing both the serbs and the kosovo albanians . " whatever kosovo becomes , kosovo will be part of europe , or possibly a member of the european union , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters on monday . russia to support the negotiations moscow will support any status of kosovo that is agreed by both belgrade and pristina , and is not a forced solution by the international community , russia 's foreign minister said during his belgrade visit on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov will travel to pristina after belgrade " there can be no forced solution , " sergei lavrov told reporters in belgrade after meeting his serbian-montenegrin counterpart vuk draskovic . " as a permanent member of the un security council and contact group , russia has always fought for and will continue to fight for a solution found through direct talks between belgrade and pristina , " said the russian minister . the so-called contact group of foreign powers that has overseen peace efforts since the former yugoslavia collapsed during the 1990s balkan wars comprises the united states , russia , germany , france , britain and italy . avoiding a chain reaction draskovic said belgrade hoped to get the " full support " of its traditional slavic and orthodox church ally to back serbia 's position on the issue . " serbia has neither the intention nor the will to rule the albanian majority in kosovo , " said the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , the only remaining union of former yugoslavia 's six republics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of orthodox churches were destroyed during anti-serbian riots in march 2004 " we recognize the right of the albanian people to organize their lives in kosovo themselves , but that right does not include ... the right to change the internationally recognized borders of our state , " he said . draskovic warned that granting kosovo independence could lead to a " chain reaction provoking turbulence in both europe and the rest of the world . " diplomatic means lavrov later met serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and president boris tadic , before heading to kosovo for a series of talks with top un officials and the provincial government in pristina on tuesday . tadic , of serbia 's pro-western democratic party , said belgrade wanted to resolve the kosovo problem by diplomatic means . " serbia does not want war .
serbia wants peaceful politics which will provide prosperity to all citizens , both serbs and albanians , and protect international interests in the whole region , " tadic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transferred from mass graves in serbia proper : the remains of albanian guerilla fighters moscow was a strong opponent of the 78-day nato bombing campaign which drove serb forces out of kosovo in june 1999 , ending a crackdown by troops under then yugoslav president slobodan milosevic against ethnic albanian rebels . when nato-led troops -lrb- kfor -rrb- moved into the province at the end of the air campaign , russian soldiers unexpectedly took control of the only functioning airport in kosovo near the provincial capital pristina .
while the move to seize the landing strip almost provoked a diplomatic incident with the west , it drew strong support from the milosevic regime and kosovo 's minority serbs . russian troops left kosovo in july 2003 , ending their four-year mission in the province .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .
operated by his american wife and webmaster , ingrid rimland , the us-based website can still be accessed , promoting zündel 's " letters from the cell " and calling for donations to support him . the trial against ernst zündel was scheduled to last five days , with a verdict originally expected to be delivered on nov .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .
european production fell 19 percent between 1995 and 2003 . eu will take action if necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson take action if necessary eu trade commissioner peter mandelson pledged friday to only take action against china on alleged dumping of footwear if it is " warranted " and " justified . " in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines . " hamburg spoils bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese shoes be banned in the future ?
in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

" for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .
european production fell 19 percent between 1995 and 2003 . eu will take action if necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson take action if necessary eu trade commissioner peter mandelson pledged friday to only take action against china on alleged dumping of footwear if it is " warranted " and " justified . " in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines . " hamburg spoils bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese shoes be banned in the future ?
in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .

" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .
operated by his american wife and webmaster , ingrid rimland , the us-based website can still be accessed , promoting zündel 's " letters from the cell " and calling for donations to support him . the trial against ernst zündel was scheduled to last five days , with a verdict originally expected to be delivered on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.11.2005 neo-nazi trial in germany begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel faces up to five years in prison the trial of one the world 's most notorious holocaust deniers , ernst zündel , was postponed shortly after it started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim .
the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .
operated by his american wife and webmaster , ingrid rimland , the us-based website can still be accessed , promoting zündel 's " letters from the cell " and calling for donations to support him . the trial against ernst zündel was scheduled to last five days , with a verdict originally expected to be delivered on nov .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .
-lrb- in the old western states , the discrepancy is even greater - in 2002 , a woman doing the same job as a man earned as much as 25 percent less . -rrb- these figures may or may not be surprising , but they speak volumes about germany 's cultural attitudes towards women - and the need for a policy broadside to take them on .
and the debate is more than ideological , according to danita hübner , european commissioner for regional policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner hübner wants to see mainstreaming take hold " gender discrimination , both overt and latent , equates to a great waste of human resources , " said hübner , addressing a gender-mainstreaming group in march .
" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .
eu members agreed to implement gender mainstreaming when they signed the 1999 amsterdam treaty .
and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .
" for example , if you did that in the construction industry - typically dominated by men - that would be nonsense .

lehne currently serves as director for southeastern europe in the secretariat of the eu council and is a senior advisor to eu foreign policy chief javier solana . un-sponsored talks on the future status of kosovo , the breakaway serbian province that has been administered by the united nations and nato since its 1998-1999 war , are expected to begin later this month . ethnic albanians , who outnumber serbs and other minorities in kosovo by more than nine-to-one , want full independence from serbia , while belgrade says it is prepared to offer pristina " more than autonomy but less than independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un kosovo envoy martti ahtisaari has received full backing from the eu lehne 's role will be to support the former finnish president and un envoy to kosovo martti ahtisaari in helping the two sides reach a compromise .
and while the outcome of the talks can not be predicted , the eu has been signaling that a parallel eu-integration of kosovo and serbia could be a way of appeasing both the serbs and the kosovo albanians . " whatever kosovo becomes , kosovo will be part of europe , or possibly a member of the european union , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters on monday . russia to support the negotiations moscow will support any status of kosovo that is agreed by both belgrade and pristina , and is not a forced solution by the international community , russia 's foreign minister said during his belgrade visit on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov will travel to pristina after belgrade " there can be no forced solution , " sergei lavrov told reporters in belgrade after meeting his serbian-montenegrin counterpart vuk draskovic . " as a permanent member of the un security council and contact group , russia has always fought for and will continue to fight for a solution found through direct talks between belgrade and pristina , " said the russian minister . the so-called contact group of foreign powers that has overseen peace efforts since the former yugoslavia collapsed during the 1990s balkan wars comprises the united states , russia , germany , france , britain and italy . avoiding a chain reaction draskovic said belgrade hoped to get the " full support " of its traditional slavic and orthodox church ally to back serbia 's position on the issue . " serbia has neither the intention nor the will to rule the albanian majority in kosovo , " said the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , the only remaining union of former yugoslavia 's six republics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of orthodox churches were destroyed during anti-serbian riots in march 2004 " we recognize the right of the albanian people to organize their lives in kosovo themselves , but that right does not include ... the right to change the internationally recognized borders of our state , " he said . draskovic warned that granting kosovo independence could lead to a " chain reaction provoking turbulence in both europe and the rest of the world . " diplomatic means lavrov later met serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and president boris tadic , before heading to kosovo for a series of talks with top un officials and the provincial government in pristina on tuesday . tadic , of serbia 's pro-western democratic party , said belgrade wanted to resolve the kosovo problem by diplomatic means . " serbia does not want war .
serbia wants peaceful politics which will provide prosperity to all citizens , both serbs and albanians , and protect international interests in the whole region , " tadic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transferred from mass graves in serbia proper : the remains of albanian guerilla fighters moscow was a strong opponent of the 78-day nato bombing campaign which drove serb forces out of kosovo in june 1999 , ending a crackdown by troops under then yugoslav president slobodan milosevic against ethnic albanian rebels . when nato-led troops -lrb- kfor -rrb- moved into the province at the end of the air campaign , russian soldiers unexpectedly took control of the only functioning airport in kosovo near the provincial capital pristina .
while the move to seize the landing strip almost provoked a diplomatic incident with the west , it drew strong support from the milosevic regime and kosovo 's minority serbs . russian troops left kosovo in july 2003 , ending their four-year mission in the province .

lehne currently serves as director for southeastern europe in the secretariat of the eu council and is a senior advisor to eu foreign policy chief javier solana . un-sponsored talks on the future status of kosovo , the breakaway serbian province that has been administered by the united nations and nato since its 1998-1999 war , are expected to begin later this month . ethnic albanians , who outnumber serbs and other minorities in kosovo by more than nine-to-one , want full independence from serbia , while belgrade says it is prepared to offer pristina " more than autonomy but less than independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un kosovo envoy martti ahtisaari has received full backing from the eu lehne 's role will be to support the former finnish president and un envoy to kosovo martti ahtisaari in helping the two sides reach a compromise .
and while the outcome of the talks can not be predicted , the eu has been signaling that a parallel eu-integration of kosovo and serbia could be a way of appeasing both the serbs and the kosovo albanians . " whatever kosovo becomes , kosovo will be part of europe , or possibly a member of the european union , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters on monday . russia to support the negotiations moscow will support any status of kosovo that is agreed by both belgrade and pristina , and is not a forced solution by the international community , russia 's foreign minister said during his belgrade visit on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov will travel to pristina after belgrade " there can be no forced solution , " sergei lavrov told reporters in belgrade after meeting his serbian-montenegrin counterpart vuk draskovic . " as a permanent member of the un security council and contact group , russia has always fought for and will continue to fight for a solution found through direct talks between belgrade and pristina , " said the russian minister . the so-called contact group of foreign powers that has overseen peace efforts since the former yugoslavia collapsed during the 1990s balkan wars comprises the united states , russia , germany , france , britain and italy . avoiding a chain reaction draskovic said belgrade hoped to get the " full support " of its traditional slavic and orthodox church ally to back serbia 's position on the issue . " serbia has neither the intention nor the will to rule the albanian majority in kosovo , " said the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , the only remaining union of former yugoslavia 's six republics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of orthodox churches were destroyed during anti-serbian riots in march 2004 " we recognize the right of the albanian people to organize their lives in kosovo themselves , but that right does not include ... the right to change the internationally recognized borders of our state , " he said . draskovic warned that granting kosovo independence could lead to a " chain reaction provoking turbulence in both europe and the rest of the world . " diplomatic means lavrov later met serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and president boris tadic , before heading to kosovo for a series of talks with top un officials and the provincial government in pristina on tuesday . tadic , of serbia 's pro-western democratic party , said belgrade wanted to resolve the kosovo problem by diplomatic means . " serbia does not want war .
serbia wants peaceful politics which will provide prosperity to all citizens , both serbs and albanians , and protect international interests in the whole region , " tadic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transferred from mass graves in serbia proper : the remains of albanian guerilla fighters moscow was a strong opponent of the 78-day nato bombing campaign which drove serb forces out of kosovo in june 1999 , ending a crackdown by troops under then yugoslav president slobodan milosevic against ethnic albanian rebels . when nato-led troops -lrb- kfor -rrb- moved into the province at the end of the air campaign , russian soldiers unexpectedly took control of the only functioning airport in kosovo near the provincial capital pristina .
while the move to seize the landing strip almost provoked a diplomatic incident with the west , it drew strong support from the milosevic regime and kosovo 's minority serbs . russian troops left kosovo in july 2003 , ending their four-year mission in the province .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.11.2005 neo-nazi trial in germany begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel faces up to five years in prison the trial of one the world 's most notorious holocaust deniers , ernst zündel , was postponed shortly after it started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim .
the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .
operated by his american wife and webmaster , ingrid rimland , the us-based website can still be accessed , promoting zündel 's " letters from the cell " and calling for donations to support him . the trial against ernst zündel was scheduled to last five days , with a verdict originally expected to be delivered on nov .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .
-lrb- in the old western states , the discrepancy is even greater - in 2002 , a woman doing the same job as a man earned as much as 25 percent less . -rrb- these figures may or may not be surprising , but they speak volumes about germany 's cultural attitudes towards women - and the need for a policy broadside to take them on .
and the debate is more than ideological , according to danita hübner , european commissioner for regional policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner hübner wants to see mainstreaming take hold " gender discrimination , both overt and latent , equates to a great waste of human resources , " said hübner , addressing a gender-mainstreaming group in march .
" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .
eu members agreed to implement gender mainstreaming when they signed the 1999 amsterdam treaty .
and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .
" for example , if you did that in the construction industry - typically dominated by men - that would be nonsense . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .
angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .
operated by his american wife and webmaster , ingrid rimland , the us-based website can still be accessed , promoting zündel 's " letters from the cell " and calling for donations to support him . the trial against ernst zündel was scheduled to last five days , with a verdict originally expected to be delivered on nov .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .

" in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .
-lrb- in the old western states , the discrepancy is even greater - in 2002 , a woman doing the same job as a man earned as much as 25 percent less . -rrb- these figures may or may not be surprising , but they speak volumes about germany 's cultural attitudes towards women - and the need for a policy broadside to take them on .
and the debate is more than ideological , according to danita hübner , european commissioner for regional policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner hübner wants to see mainstreaming take hold " gender discrimination , both overt and latent , equates to a great waste of human resources , " said hübner , addressing a gender-mainstreaming group in march .
" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .
eu members agreed to implement gender mainstreaming when they signed the 1999 amsterdam treaty .
and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .
" for example , if you did that in the construction industry - typically dominated by men - that would be nonsense . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

lehne currently serves as director for southeastern europe in the secretariat of the eu council and is a senior advisor to eu foreign policy chief javier solana . un-sponsored talks on the future status of kosovo , the breakaway serbian province that has been administered by the united nations and nato since its 1998-1999 war , are expected to begin later this month . ethnic albanians , who outnumber serbs and other minorities in kosovo by more than nine-to-one , want full independence from serbia , while belgrade says it is prepared to offer pristina " more than autonomy but less than independence .

and while the outcome of the talks can not be predicted , the eu has been signaling that a parallel eu-integration of kosovo and serbia could be a way of appeasing both the serbs and the kosovo albanians . " whatever kosovo becomes , kosovo will be part of europe , or possibly a member of the european union , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters on monday . russia to support the negotiations moscow will support any status of kosovo that is agreed by both belgrade and pristina , and is not a forced solution by the international community , russia 's foreign minister said during his belgrade visit on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov will travel to pristina after belgrade " there can be no forced solution , " sergei lavrov told reporters in belgrade after meeting his serbian-montenegrin counterpart vuk draskovic .

" serbia has neither the intention nor the will to rule the albanian majority in kosovo , " said the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , the only remaining union of former yugoslavia 's six republics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of orthodox churches were destroyed during anti-serbian riots in march 2004 " we recognize the right of the albanian people to organize their lives in kosovo themselves , but that right does not include ... the right to change the internationally recognized borders of our state , " he said . draskovic warned that granting kosovo independence could lead to a " chain reaction provoking turbulence in both europe and the rest of the world . " diplomatic means lavrov later met serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and president boris tadic , before heading to kosovo for a series of talks with top un officials and the provincial government in pristina on tuesday . tadic , of serbia 's pro-western democratic party , said belgrade wanted to resolve the kosovo problem by diplomatic means . " serbia does not want war .
serbia wants peaceful politics which will provide prosperity to all citizens , both serbs and albanians , and protect international interests in the whole region , " tadic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transferred from mass graves in serbia proper : the remains of albanian guerilla fighters moscow was a strong opponent of the 78-day nato bombing campaign which drove serb forces out of kosovo in june 1999 , ending a crackdown by troops under then yugoslav president slobodan milosevic against ethnic albanian rebels . when nato-led troops -lrb- kfor -rrb- moved into the province at the end of the air campaign , russian soldiers unexpectedly took control of the only functioning airport in kosovo near the provincial capital pristina .
while the move to seize the landing strip almost provoked a diplomatic incident with the west , it drew strong support from the milosevic regime and kosovo 's minority serbs . russian troops left kosovo in july 2003 , ending their four-year mission in the province .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december .

" for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea .

" all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .

" we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .
-lrb- in the old western states , the discrepancy is even greater - in 2002 , a woman doing the same job as a man earned as much as 25 percent less . -rrb- these figures may or may not be surprising , but they speak volumes about germany 's cultural attitudes towards women - and the need for a policy broadside to take them on .
and the debate is more than ideological , according to danita hübner , european commissioner for regional policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner hübner wants to see mainstreaming take hold " gender discrimination , both overt and latent , equates to a great waste of human resources , " said hübner , addressing a gender-mainstreaming group in march .
" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .
eu members agreed to implement gender mainstreaming when they signed the 1999 amsterdam treaty .
and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .
" for example , if you did that in the construction industry - typically dominated by men - that would be nonsense . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .
european production fell 19 percent between 1995 and 2003 . eu will take action if necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson take action if necessary eu trade commissioner peter mandelson pledged friday to only take action against china on alleged dumping of footwear if it is " warranted " and " justified . " in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines . " hamburg spoils bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese shoes be banned in the future ?
in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .

" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .

so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .

lehne currently serves as director for southeastern europe in the secretariat of the eu council and is a senior advisor to eu foreign policy chief javier solana . un-sponsored talks on the future status of kosovo , the breakaway serbian province that has been administered by the united nations and nato since its 1998-1999 war , are expected to begin later this month . ethnic albanians , who outnumber serbs and other minorities in kosovo by more than nine-to-one , want full independence from serbia , while belgrade says it is prepared to offer pristina " more than autonomy but less than independence .

and while the outcome of the talks can not be predicted , the eu has been signaling that a parallel eu-integration of kosovo and serbia could be a way of appeasing both the serbs and the kosovo albanians . " whatever kosovo becomes , kosovo will be part of europe , or possibly a member of the european union , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters on monday . russia to support the negotiations moscow will support any status of kosovo that is agreed by both belgrade and pristina , and is not a forced solution by the international community , russia 's foreign minister said during his belgrade visit on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov will travel to pristina after belgrade " there can be no forced solution , " sergei lavrov told reporters in belgrade after meeting his serbian-montenegrin counterpart vuk draskovic . " as a permanent member of the un security council and contact group , russia has always fought for and will continue to fight for a solution found through direct talks between belgrade and pristina , " said the russian minister . the so-called contact group of foreign powers that has overseen peace efforts since the former yugoslavia collapsed during the 1990s balkan wars comprises the united states , russia , germany , france , britain and italy . avoiding a chain reaction draskovic said belgrade hoped to get the " full support " of its traditional slavic and orthodox church ally to back serbia 's position on the issue . " serbia has neither the intention nor the will to rule the albanian majority in kosovo , " said the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , the only remaining union of former yugoslavia 's six republics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of orthodox churches were destroyed during anti-serbian riots in march 2004 " we recognize the right of the albanian people to organize their lives in kosovo themselves , but that right does not include ... the right to change the internationally recognized borders of our state , " he said . draskovic warned that granting kosovo independence could lead to a " chain reaction provoking turbulence in both europe and the rest of the world . " diplomatic means lavrov later met serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and president boris tadic , before heading to kosovo for a series of talks with top un officials and the provincial government in pristina on tuesday . tadic , of serbia 's pro-western democratic party , said belgrade wanted to resolve the kosovo problem by diplomatic means . " serbia does not want war .
serbia wants peaceful politics which will provide prosperity to all citizens , both serbs and albanians , and protect international interests in the whole region , " tadic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transferred from mass graves in serbia proper : the remains of albanian guerilla fighters moscow was a strong opponent of the 78-day nato bombing campaign which drove serb forces out of kosovo in june 1999 , ending a crackdown by troops under then yugoslav president slobodan milosevic against ethnic albanian rebels . when nato-led troops -lrb- kfor -rrb- moved into the province at the end of the air campaign , russian soldiers unexpectedly took control of the only functioning airport in kosovo near the provincial capital pristina .
while the move to seize the landing strip almost provoked a diplomatic incident with the west , it drew strong support from the milosevic regime and kosovo 's minority serbs . russian troops left kosovo in july 2003 , ending their four-year mission in the province .

" all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .

lehne currently serves as director for southeastern europe in the secretariat of the eu council and is a senior advisor to eu foreign policy chief javier solana . un-sponsored talks on the future status of kosovo , the breakaway serbian province that has been administered by the united nations and nato since its 1998-1999 war , are expected to begin later this month . ethnic albanians , who outnumber serbs and other minorities in kosovo by more than nine-to-one , want full independence from serbia , while belgrade says it is prepared to offer pristina " more than autonomy but less than independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un kosovo envoy martti ahtisaari has received full backing from the eu lehne 's role will be to support the former finnish president and un envoy to kosovo martti ahtisaari in helping the two sides reach a compromise .
and while the outcome of the talks can not be predicted , the eu has been signaling that a parallel eu-integration of kosovo and serbia could be a way of appeasing both the serbs and the kosovo albanians . " whatever kosovo becomes , kosovo will be part of europe , or possibly a member of the european union , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters on monday . russia to support the negotiations moscow will support any status of kosovo that is agreed by both belgrade and pristina , and is not a forced solution by the international community , russia 's foreign minister said during his belgrade visit on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov will travel to pristina after belgrade " there can be no forced solution , " sergei lavrov told reporters in belgrade after meeting his serbian-montenegrin counterpart vuk draskovic . " as a permanent member of the un security council and contact group , russia has always fought for and will continue to fight for a solution found through direct talks between belgrade and pristina , " said the russian minister . the so-called contact group of foreign powers that has overseen peace efforts since the former yugoslavia collapsed during the 1990s balkan wars comprises the united states , russia , germany , france , britain and italy . avoiding a chain reaction draskovic said belgrade hoped to get the " full support " of its traditional slavic and orthodox church ally to back serbia 's position on the issue . " serbia has neither the intention nor the will to rule the albanian majority in kosovo , " said the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , the only remaining union of former yugoslavia 's six republics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of orthodox churches were destroyed during anti-serbian riots in march 2004 " we recognize the right of the albanian people to organize their lives in kosovo themselves , but that right does not include ... the right to change the internationally recognized borders of our state , " he said . draskovic warned that granting kosovo independence could lead to a " chain reaction provoking turbulence in both europe and the rest of the world . " diplomatic means lavrov later met serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and president boris tadic , before heading to kosovo for a series of talks with top un officials and the provincial government in pristina on tuesday . tadic , of serbia 's pro-western democratic party , said belgrade wanted to resolve the kosovo problem by diplomatic means . " serbia does not want war .
serbia wants peaceful politics which will provide prosperity to all citizens , both serbs and albanians , and protect international interests in the whole region , " tadic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transferred from mass graves in serbia proper : the remains of albanian guerilla fighters moscow was a strong opponent of the 78-day nato bombing campaign which drove serb forces out of kosovo in june 1999 , ending a crackdown by troops under then yugoslav president slobodan milosevic against ethnic albanian rebels . when nato-led troops -lrb- kfor -rrb- moved into the province at the end of the air campaign , russian soldiers unexpectedly took control of the only functioning airport in kosovo near the provincial capital pristina .
while the move to seize the landing strip almost provoked a diplomatic incident with the west , it drew strong support from the milosevic regime and kosovo 's minority serbs . russian troops left kosovo in july 2003 , ending their four-year mission in the province .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .

he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .
european production fell 19 percent between 1995 and 2003 . eu will take action if necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson take action if necessary eu trade commissioner peter mandelson pledged friday to only take action against china on alleged dumping of footwear if it is " warranted " and " justified . " in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines . " hamburg spoils bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese shoes be banned in the future ?
in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

" we have to improve integration , especially that of young people . " others such as cdu parliamentarian hermann gröhe , said that germans had sometimes been too tolerant in the past . " if our society has not been interested or kept quiet about female circumcision and forced marriages in parallel societies , about people - almost always women - getting murdered because the family 's honor requires it , that has nothing to do with respecting other cultures , " gröhe told german public broadcaster rbb .

and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .
" for example , if you did that in the construction industry - typically dominated by men - that would be nonsense .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december .

the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .
-lrb- in the old western states , the discrepancy is even greater - in 2002 , a woman doing the same job as a man earned as much as 25 percent less . -rrb- these figures may or may not be surprising , but they speak volumes about germany 's cultural attitudes towards women - and the need for a policy broadside to take them on .
and the debate is more than ideological , according to danita hübner , european commissioner for regional policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner hübner wants to see mainstreaming take hold " gender discrimination , both overt and latent , equates to a great waste of human resources , " said hübner , addressing a gender-mainstreaming group in march .
" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .
eu members agreed to implement gender mainstreaming when they signed the 1999 amsterdam treaty .
and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .
" for example , if you did that in the construction industry - typically dominated by men - that would be nonsense . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

lehne currently serves as director for southeastern europe in the secretariat of the eu council and is a senior advisor to eu foreign policy chief javier solana . un-sponsored talks on the future status of kosovo , the breakaway serbian province that has been administered by the united nations and nato since its 1998-1999 war , are expected to begin later this month . ethnic albanians , who outnumber serbs and other minorities in kosovo by more than nine-to-one , want full independence from serbia , while belgrade says it is prepared to offer pristina " more than autonomy but less than independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un kosovo envoy martti ahtisaari has received full backing from the eu lehne 's role will be to support the former finnish president and un envoy to kosovo martti ahtisaari in helping the two sides reach a compromise .
and while the outcome of the talks can not be predicted , the eu has been signaling that a parallel eu-integration of kosovo and serbia could be a way of appeasing both the serbs and the kosovo albanians .

lehne currently serves as director for southeastern europe in the secretariat of the eu council and is a senior advisor to eu foreign policy chief javier solana . un-sponsored talks on the future status of kosovo , the breakaway serbian province that has been administered by the united nations and nato since its 1998-1999 war , are expected to begin later this month . ethnic albanians , who outnumber serbs and other minorities in kosovo by more than nine-to-one , want full independence from serbia , while belgrade says it is prepared to offer pristina " more than autonomy but less than independence .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december .

" for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea .

" all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .

the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .

" " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .
operated by his american wife and webmaster , ingrid rimland , the us-based website can still be accessed , promoting zündel 's " letters from the cell " and calling for donations to support him . the trial against ernst zündel was scheduled to last five days , with a verdict originally expected to be delivered on nov .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .
european production fell 19 percent between 1995 and 2003 . eu will take action if necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson take action if necessary eu trade commissioner peter mandelson pledged friday to only take action against china on alleged dumping of footwear if it is " warranted " and " justified . " in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines . " hamburg spoils bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese shoes be banned in the future ?
in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .
operated by his american wife and webmaster , ingrid rimland , the us-based website can still be accessed , promoting zündel 's " letters from the cell " and calling for donations to support him . the trial against ernst zündel was scheduled to last five days , with a verdict originally expected to be delivered on nov .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .

the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .
-lrb- in the old western states , the discrepancy is even greater - in 2002 , a woman doing the same job as a man earned as much as 25 percent less . -rrb- these figures may or may not be surprising , but they speak volumes about germany 's cultural attitudes towards women - and the need for a policy broadside to take them on .
and the debate is more than ideological , according to danita hübner , european commissioner for regional policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner hübner wants to see mainstreaming take hold " gender discrimination , both overt and latent , equates to a great waste of human resources , " said hübner , addressing a gender-mainstreaming group in march .
" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .
eu members agreed to implement gender mainstreaming when they signed the 1999 amsterdam treaty .
and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .
" for example , if you did that in the construction industry - typically dominated by men - that would be nonsense .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .
european production fell 19 percent between 1995 and 2003 . eu will take action if necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson take action if necessary eu trade commissioner peter mandelson pledged friday to only take action against china on alleged dumping of footwear if it is " warranted " and " justified . " in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines . " hamburg spoils bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese shoes be banned in the future ?
in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.11.2005 neo-nazi trial in germany begins großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel faces up to five years in prison the trial of one the world 's most notorious holocaust deniers , ernst zündel , was postponed shortly after it started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim .
the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .
operated by his american wife and webmaster , ingrid rimland , the us-based website can still be accessed , promoting zündel 's " letters from the cell " and calling for donations to support him . the trial against ernst zündel was scheduled to last five days , with a verdict originally expected to be delivered on nov .

but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .

this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .
operated by his american wife and webmaster , ingrid rimland , the us-based website can still be accessed , promoting zündel 's " letters from the cell " and calling for donations to support him . the trial against ernst zündel was scheduled to last five days , with a verdict originally expected to be delivered on nov .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .
european production fell 19 percent between 1995 and 2003 . eu will take action if necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson take action if necessary eu trade commissioner peter mandelson pledged friday to only take action against china on alleged dumping of footwear if it is " warranted " and " justified . " in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines . " hamburg spoils bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese shoes be banned in the future ?
in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .

" " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines .

in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

the judge dismissed two members of zündel 's defense team . if convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred , ernst zündel could be sentenced to five years in prison .
but the trial , which started on tuesday in the german city of mannheim , was postponed after judge ulrich meinerzhagen ruled that horst mahler , a member of zündel 's defense team , could not participate in the proceedings . mahler , who in the 1970s was associated with the far-left movement , has since become a vociferous proponent of far-right , anti-semitic ideology .
he was disbarred last year and sentenced to nine months in prison in january for provoking racial hatred . judge meinerzhagen also dismissed zündel 's publicly appointed defender sylvia stolz on the grounds that her written submissions to the court reflected the ideas of horst mahler .
although the defendant said he was satisfied with the rest of his defense team and did not need a publicly appointed defender , the judge ruled that a new public defender should be appointed .
the trial will resume on nov .
15 . two decades of hate zündel has been a leading holocaust denier for more than two decades .
the 65-year old german left his home country at the age of 19 and emigrated to canada where he soon came under the influence of leading north american neonazis . in the 1970s , zündel set up toronto-based " samisdat publishing , " which soon became one of the world 's main distributors of nazi propaganda and memorabilia .
through this company he issued his book " the hitler we loved and why , " along with countless leaflets carrying with titles such as " did six million really die ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel denies that millions were murdered by the nazis his repeated denials of the holocaust resulted in several trials in canada , where authorities convicted him of " knowingly publishing false news " in 1988 .
only four years later the canadian supreme court , however , overturned the ruling , decreeing that it violated freedom of expression . anti-semitism via the internet in 1995 zündel took his propaganda to a new level when he became the inspiration and the key content provider of the the so called " zündelsite , " a leading online forum of holocaust denial and anti-semitic propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters protested against his extradition through the internet , zündel 's anit-semitic theories could be easily accessed and read from anywhere in the world , including germany .
this eventually prompted german authorities to pen a case against the holocaust denier on charges of inciting racial hatred . it was only this year that canadian authorities finally agreed to his extradition , opening the way for zündel trial in germany . german law requires prosecution " in 1993 denial of the existence of the holocaust became a crime in germany , " said wolfgang kapust , a journalist and specialist on the subject .
" since that time german prosecutors can - in fact must - intervene in such cases . " kapust added that the prosecution of nazis , neonazis and holocaust deniers has been quite successful since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel in canadian detention in 2003 while zündel is on trial in germany , his web site is , however , still spreading anti-semitic and right extremist propaganda .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december .

" for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .

" " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines .

lehne currently serves as director for southeastern europe in the secretariat of the eu council and is a senior advisor to eu foreign policy chief javier solana . un-sponsored talks on the future status of kosovo , the breakaway serbian province that has been administered by the united nations and nato since its 1998-1999 war , are expected to begin later this month . ethnic albanians , who outnumber serbs and other minorities in kosovo by more than nine-to-one , want full independence from serbia , while belgrade says it is prepared to offer pristina " more than autonomy but less than independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un kosovo envoy martti ahtisaari has received full backing from the eu lehne 's role will be to support the former finnish president and un envoy to kosovo martti ahtisaari in helping the two sides reach a compromise .
and while the outcome of the talks can not be predicted , the eu has been signaling that a parallel eu-integration of kosovo and serbia could be a way of appeasing both the serbs and the kosovo albanians . " whatever kosovo becomes , kosovo will be part of europe , or possibly a member of the european union , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters on monday . russia to support the negotiations moscow will support any status of kosovo that is agreed by both belgrade and pristina , and is not a forced solution by the international community , russia 's foreign minister said during his belgrade visit on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov will travel to pristina after belgrade " there can be no forced solution , " sergei lavrov told reporters in belgrade after meeting his serbian-montenegrin counterpart vuk draskovic . " as a permanent member of the un security council and contact group , russia has always fought for and will continue to fight for a solution found through direct talks between belgrade and pristina , " said the russian minister . the so-called contact group of foreign powers that has overseen peace efforts since the former yugoslavia collapsed during the 1990s balkan wars comprises the united states , russia , germany , france , britain and italy . avoiding a chain reaction draskovic said belgrade hoped to get the " full support " of its traditional slavic and orthodox church ally to back serbia 's position on the issue . " serbia has neither the intention nor the will to rule the albanian majority in kosovo , " said the foreign minister of serbia-montenegro , the only remaining union of former yugoslavia 's six republics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of orthodox churches were destroyed during anti-serbian riots in march 2004 " we recognize the right of the albanian people to organize their lives in kosovo themselves , but that right does not include ... the right to change the internationally recognized borders of our state , " he said . draskovic warned that granting kosovo independence could lead to a " chain reaction provoking turbulence in both europe and the rest of the world . " diplomatic means lavrov later met serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and president boris tadic , before heading to kosovo for a series of talks with top un officials and the provincial government in pristina on tuesday . tadic , of serbia 's pro-western democratic party , said belgrade wanted to resolve the kosovo problem by diplomatic means . " serbia does not want war .
serbia wants peaceful politics which will provide prosperity to all citizens , both serbs and albanians , and protect international interests in the whole region , " tadic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transferred from mass graves in serbia proper : the remains of albanian guerilla fighters moscow was a strong opponent of the 78-day nato bombing campaign which drove serb forces out of kosovo in june 1999 , ending a crackdown by troops under then yugoslav president slobodan milosevic against ethnic albanian rebels . when nato-led troops -lrb- kfor -rrb- moved into the province at the end of the air campaign , russian soldiers unexpectedly took control of the only functioning airport in kosovo near the provincial capital pristina .
while the move to seize the landing strip almost provoked a diplomatic incident with the west , it drew strong support from the milosevic regime and kosovo 's minority serbs . russian troops left kosovo in july 2003 , ending their four-year mission in the province .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .
-lrb- in the old western states , the discrepancy is even greater - in 2002 , a woman doing the same job as a man earned as much as 25 percent less . -rrb- these figures may or may not be surprising , but they speak volumes about germany 's cultural attitudes towards women - and the need for a policy broadside to take them on .
and the debate is more than ideological , according to danita hübner , european commissioner for regional policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner hübner wants to see mainstreaming take hold " gender discrimination , both overt and latent , equates to a great waste of human resources , " said hübner , addressing a gender-mainstreaming group in march .
" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .
eu members agreed to implement gender mainstreaming when they signed the 1999 amsterdam treaty .
and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .
-lrb- in the old western states , the discrepancy is even greater - in 2002 , a woman doing the same job as a man earned as much as 25 percent less . -rrb- these figures may or may not be surprising , but they speak volumes about germany 's cultural attitudes towards women - and the need for a policy broadside to take them on .
and the debate is more than ideological , according to danita hübner , european commissioner for regional policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner hübner wants to see mainstreaming take hold " gender discrimination , both overt and latent , equates to a great waste of human resources , " said hübner , addressing a gender-mainstreaming group in march .
" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .
eu members agreed to implement gender mainstreaming when they signed the 1999 amsterdam treaty .
and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?
the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .
" for example , if you did that in the construction industry - typically dominated by men - that would be nonsense . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .
angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .
european production fell 19 percent between 1995 and 2003 . eu will take action if necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson take action if necessary eu trade commissioner peter mandelson pledged friday to only take action against china on alleged dumping of footwear if it is " warranted " and " justified . " in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines . " hamburg spoils bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese shoes be banned in the future ?
in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

china will use upcoming visits to europe by its top leaders to push an ambitious diplomatic agenda , with trade issues - including the possible eu anti-dumping tariffs for chinese shoes - likely to dominate talks . chinese president hu jintao will kick off a european tour on tuesday with stops in britain , germany and spain , while premier wen jiabao will visit four eu countries , including france , in early december . " this is evidence of china 's increasing influence on the world stage , " says gilles guiheux , director of the french center for the study of contemporary china in hong kong . a diplomatic offensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao will kick off his european tour in the uk after talks with british prime minister tony blair in london , hu will meet with incoming german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he is expected to sign a contract with engineering giant siemens for 60 high-speed ice trains . " for china , europe is above all a source of capital and technology , " says guiheux , adding that the eu lags far behind the united states in terms of political influence in beijing . as evidence of washington 's higher profile in china , us president george w. bush is due in beijing on november 19 after the asia-pacific economic cooperation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit in south korea . " on all the major issues , the europeans stand out because of their absence , " guiheux notes , emphasizing the stronger positions taken by washington on a number of points , including concerns over increased chinese military spending . troubled waters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier wen jiabao will visit france , portugal , the czech republic and slovakia just a few days before hu 's arrival in britain , which currently holds the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , china revived one of the thorniest issues in their relations - the bloc 's arms embargo against beijing . " all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing told journalists friday . " this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago , " li said , highlighting the fact that the embargo was having a negative impact on trade and should be lifted . eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-secession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . a new trade war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian wootwear association is worried about the chinese competition the arms embargo , however , is not the only thorny issue in the chinese-european relations .
the financial times reported on friday that the european union is preparing new anti-dumping tariffs on china 's leather and reinforced shoes in a bid to control the country 's booming exports . following an investigation that found chinese exporters were dumping footwear - selling it below production cost - eu trade commissioner peter mandelson will unveil the punitive measures in the coming month , the newspaper said quoting a senior eu official . after inspectors toured asian factories and european distribution outlets , there was " quite compelling evidence of dumping , " the official in brussels said . a preliminary discussion about the shoe tariffs among representatives from the 25 eu member states is scheduled for wednesday , the newspaper said . overcrowded markets while not directly linked to the recent spat over booming imports of cheap textiles from china , the anti-dumping tariffs would also be aimed at protecting european producers by invoking world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- rules . the measures follow a complaint from european shoe manufactures lodged on may 17 .
the italian footwear association says imports of leather shoes from china rose 900 percent in the first five months of this year , the newspaper said . eu statistics showed an increase on average of 700 percent in import volumes and a 28 percent drop in prices for six categories of leather and fabric shoes .
china is the worlds largest exporter of footwear and asia already accounts for about three-quarters of worldwide production .
european production fell 19 percent between 1995 and 2003 . eu will take action if necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson take action if necessary eu trade commissioner peter mandelson pledged friday to only take action against china on alleged dumping of footwear if it is " warranted " and " justified . " in a joint news conference with chinese commerce minister bo xilai , mandelson said he expected the results of an eu anti-dumping probe opened at the end of june to " come in due course . " " but i will not be taking action unless i 'm absolutely convinced that it is justified and warranted , " mandelson added . bo said he hoped the commission would stave off imposing the measures . " we do n't want to see these industries facing anti-dumping measures by the eu .
our trading relationship is of a complimentary nature , " bo said . although mandelson said his talks with bo had touched on footwear only in passing , there were more focused discussions on china 's cherished goal of gaining market economy status , which is important regarding how anti-dumping charges are handled . mandelson , however , would not be drawn into issuing precise timing on granting china market economy status , saying : " we are working on the substance and not deadlines . " hamburg spoils bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will chinese shoes be banned in the future ?
in a separate development , german customs officers said friday they had seized 700,000 shirts , trousers and pairs of shoes from china at the northern port of hamburg since september on suspicion that the shipments violated import laws . the hamburg customs investigation office said the 32 containers of clothing that have been seized did not carry the relevant import approval documentation and that the invoices were misleading . although the shipments were purportedly bound for importers in hungary , poland and the czech republic , authorities said they suspected that the clothing was bound for other european union countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china urges eu to " trash " arms embargo china has said the eu 's 16-year-old arms embargo is having a negative impact on trade and should be trashed , signaling the issue will be a top priority when president hu jintao visits europe this week .

participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .

the director of gisa , thomas claus , warns against such blanket actions . " i 'm not against quotas , but you ca n't apply them to all areas of business , " he said .

but while quotas have helped the fairer sex make strides in politics , the boardroom remains a boys ' room . angela merkel is likely to soon assume germany 's highest political office , the chancellorship , and the country 's political ranks are bursting with strong , outspoken women .
yet there are very few high-level female managers in german business - just seven of the 525 board positions in germany 's 100 top firms are held by women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids need outside care when moms go to work a two-day informal gender-equality conference put on by the eu 's women and equality unit and currently underway in britain is taking a closer look at this imbalance .
participants from various eu countries will be answering the question " what works for women ? " and examining strategies on childcare , education and skill building aimed at helping more european women climb the corporate ladder . women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business in europe .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just 3 percent in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dorrepaal landed the big one : a seat on schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies .
no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected . pay discrepancies lay the matter out in black and white : in germany , women earn an average of 16 percent less than men , with the difference increasing toward the top of the career ladder .
-lrb- in the old western states , the discrepancy is even greater - in 2002 , a woman doing the same job as a man earned as much as 25 percent less . -rrb- these figures may or may not be surprising , but they speak volumes about germany 's cultural attitudes towards women - and the need for a policy broadside to take them on .
and the debate is more than ideological , according to danita hübner , european commissioner for regional policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner hübner wants to see mainstreaming take hold " gender discrimination , both overt and latent , equates to a great waste of human resources , " said hübner , addressing a gender-mainstreaming group in march .
" eliminating discrimination will lead to gains in both employment and productivity . " for eu officials , the long-term answer to such problems is " gender mainstreaming , " which means the processes put in place to ensure gender equality is taken into account in all aspects of policy planning .
eu members agreed to implement gender mainstreaming when they signed the 1999 amsterdam treaty .
and they reiterated their commitment to " promote gender equality and empower women " as part of the millennium development goals in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women need solidarity sweeping societal changes do n't take place overnight , however , and the gender-mainstreaming debate seems to take place mostly in rarified policy circles .
so far , the eu has created a european institute for gender equality to gather international data on gender equality ; it also funds gender-equity projects and initiatives on the international , state and local levels . one of these initiatives is the gender institute of saxony-anhalt , or gisa , the first " competency center " on gender issues in germany . among other things , the center trains local politicians in gender issues , collects and publishes data that can be used in policy-making , and has implemented a process to rigorously check national laws for their potential effects on gender relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is one of many women in politics - thanks to quotas meanwhile , one area where german women have , indeed , gained power is politics .
merkel is just the crest of a wave of women public servants surging onto the local and national scene .
yet this change did not come as the result of an outpouring of feminist sentiment - or from the implementation of bureaucratic programs at the eu level . simply put , it can be traced directly to a quota system for candidates pioneered by the green party in the 1980s and later emulated by the social democrats and the christian democrats . could we just put quotas on jobs , making faster inroads into inequality than the reams of project papers currently put out in brussels ?

focusing on climate change during a 35-minute speech in san francisco , he told a 300-strong audience : " we simply can not go on as we are . "
he said the us had the chance to use its power and influence for the " greater good of the global community " .
the prince is touring the us accompanied by the duchess of cornwall .
pizza and soup during the speech , which earned him a standing ovation , he defended himself against the accusation that he was " anti-science " , insisting he was " just pro its appropriate use . "
couple tuck in to organic fare echoing a message he gave in a toast at the white house in washington last week , he concluded that for the sake of future generations world leaders must take a long-term view .
he told the audience , drawn from the business , public and academic sectors : " throughout my lifetime , your country has been willing to take responsible action for the greater good of the global community , even when it had no direct need to do so .
" the environmental crisis we face is another situation in which i believe the united states could use its power and its influence to help create a sense of unity in a common cause among disparate peoples and sectors of society . "
the speech marked the launch of a west coast version of his own business and the environment programme .
earlier , the royal couple sampled organic delights as they visited an " edible school yard " near san francisco .

new south wales police chief ken moroney said a " potentially catastrophic attack " had been averted .
one suspect was shot and wounded during a raid in sydney .
chemicals , weapons , and computers were seized , police said .
the operation came nearly a week after australia 's anti-terror laws were changed to give police greater powers .
police raided 23 houses in sydney and melbourne early on tuesday , as part of the country 's largest counter-terrorism operation .
the raids involved about 500 police officers and followed a 16-month investigation , officials said .
" i 'm satisfied that we have disrupted what i would regard as the final stages of a large-scale terrorist attack , or the launch of a terrorist attack , " mr moroney told australia 's abc radio .
court appearances those arrested in melbourne include abu bakr , an outspoken algerian-australian cleric who has in the past praised osama bin laden as " a great man " .
he was among nine men who appeared in court in the city on tuesday , and were charged with membership of a " terrorist organisation " .
abu bakr profile of ' spiritual leader ' prosecutor richard maidment told the court the men had formed a terrorist group to kill " innocent men and women in australia " .
he claims they received military-style training in rural australia and had discussions about bomb-making .
those arrested in sydney are also due to appear in court .
" the members of the sydney group have been gathering chemicals of a kind that were used in the london underground bombings , " mr maidment said , adding that abu bakr was the ringleader of both the melbourne and sydney groups .
police said one of the suspects in sydney was shot and seriously wounded after they came under fire .
they said the suspect had refused orders to surrender .
there was no immediate comment from those arrested .
us ally police declined to give details of the likely target of the attack , but victoria state police chief christine nixon said next year 's commonwealth games , to be held in the city , were not a target .
terror raids in pictures : australia raids prime minister john howard said the arrests vindicated the government 's decision to rush through amendments to the anti-terror laws .
" this country has never been immune from a possible terrorist attack , " he said in a televised news conference .
" it 's important that we continue to mobilise all of the resources of the commonwealth and the states to fight terrorism . "
the changes were enacted on thursday , to make it easier for police to prosecute suspects believed to be planning attacks .
mr howard at the time said he had received credible intelligence of a " terrorist threat " .
australia is a key ally of the us in its " war on terror " , and has sent troops to fight in iraq and afghanistan .
there has never been a major terrorist attack on australian soil , although 88 australians died in the 2002 bali bombings , and australia 's embassy in indonesia was bombed in 2004 .

" i 'm satisfied that we have disrupted what i would regard as the final stages of a large-scale terrorist attack , or the launch of a terrorist attack , " mr moroney told australia 's abc radio .
court appearances those arrested in melbourne include abu bakr , an outspoken algerian-australian cleric who has in the past praised osama bin laden as " a great man " .
he was among nine men who appeared in court in the city on tuesday , and were charged with membership of a " terrorist organisation " .
abu bakr profile of ' spiritual leader ' prosecutor richard maidment told the court the men had formed a terrorist group to kill " innocent men and women in australia " .
he claims they received military-style training in rural australia and had discussions about bomb-making .
those arrested in sydney are also due to appear in court .
" the members of the sydney group have been gathering chemicals of a kind that were used in the london underground bombings , " mr maidment said , adding that abu bakr was the ringleader of both the melbourne and sydney groups .
police said one of the suspects in sydney was shot and seriously wounded after they came under fire .
they said the suspect had refused orders to surrender .
there was no immediate comment from those arrested .
us ally police declined to give details of the likely target of the attack , but victoria state police chief christine nixon said next year 's commonwealth games , to be held in the city , were not a target .
terror raids in pictures : australia raids prime minister john howard said the arrests vindicated the government 's decision to rush through amendments to the anti-terror laws .
" this country has never been immune from a possible terrorist attack , " he said in a televised news conference .
" it 's important that we continue to mobilise all of the resources of the commonwealth and the states to fight terrorism . "
the changes were enacted on thursday , to make it easier for police to prosecute suspects believed to be planning attacks .
mr howard at the time said he had received credible intelligence of a " terrorist threat " .
australia is a key ally of the us in its " war on terror " , and has sent troops to fight in iraq and afghanistan .
there has never been a major terrorist attack on australian soil , although 88 australians died in the 2002 bali bombings , and australia 's embassy in indonesia was bombed in 2004 .

shares rose to 578 pence at close , valuing the firm at £ 11bn -lrb- $ 19.5bn -rrb- .
the company has reportedly begun talks over a possible takeover bid by german utility firm e.on , while scottish and southern energy may also be interested .
e.on already owns electricity and gas supplier powergen and buying scottish power would give the firm nearly 16 million uk customers .
other reports have said that scottish and southern energy -lrb- sse -rrb- - which supplies energy to 6.1 million customers - had appointed credit suisse to advise it on a possible move for scottish power .
both scottish power and sse declined to comment on the reports .
however , analysts suggested that scottish power might be looking at a deal that would value the company at between 600p and 650p .
competition questions in september , e.on issued a statement saying that it was considering a move for scottish power , although it added that no approach had been made .
scottish power supplies energy to 5.2 million users in the uk .
it has been eyed as a possible takeover target since may this year when it announced the $ 5.1bn sale of its us pacificorp business to midamerican , a deal which has yet to be cleared by regulators .
however , given the large number of uk customers a combined powergen-scottish power business would have , a takeover bid by e.on would almost certainly require approval by competition authorities .
a merger between scottish power and sse is also likely to attract the attention of competition authorities , as the two firms supply 70 % of electricity and gas customers in scotland .
the reuters news agency says that sources have told it that sse is unlikely to get into a bidding war with e.on , one of the largest power companies in europe , but might be interested in a deal if other plans fall through .
both e.on and scottish power report their results on thursday .

shares rose to 578 pence at close , valuing the firm at £ 11bn -lrb- $ 19.5bn -rrb- .
the company has reportedly begun talks over a possible takeover bid by german utility firm e.on , while scottish and southern energy may also be interested .
e.on already owns electricity and gas supplier powergen and buying scottish power would give the firm nearly 16 million uk customers .
other reports have said that scottish and southern energy -lrb- sse -rrb- - which supplies energy to 6.1 million customers - had appointed credit suisse to advise it on a possible move for scottish power .
both scottish power and sse declined to comment on the reports .
however , analysts suggested that scottish power might be looking at a deal that would value the company at between 600p and 650p .
competition questions in september , e.on issued a statement saying that it was considering a move for scottish power , although it added that no approach had been made .
scottish power supplies energy to 5.2 million users in the uk .
it has been eyed as a possible takeover target since may this year when it announced the $ 5.1bn sale of its us pacificorp business to midamerican , a deal which has yet to be cleared by regulators .
however , given the large number of uk customers a combined powergen-scottish power business would have , a takeover bid by e.on would almost certainly require approval by competition authorities .
a merger between scottish power and sse is also likely to attract the attention of competition authorities , as the two firms supply 70 % of electricity and gas customers in scotland .
the reuters news agency says that sources have told it that sse is unlikely to get into a bidding war with e.on , one of the largest power companies in europe , but might be interested in a deal if other plans fall through .
both e.on and scottish power report their results on thursday .

like-for-like sales were down 0.2 % in october , according to figures from the british retail consortium -lrb- brc -rrb- .
over the last three months , sales have fallen by 0.7 % compared to the same period last year .
however , the decline in sales was less severe than in the 0.8 % in september , suggesting that the worst might be over for britain 's struggling retail sector .
the brc said it was pleased by the slowdown in declining sales .
" another slight improvement in like-for like sales is very welcome , especially considering the downward trend in the first half of this year , " said kevin hawkins , brc director-general .
clothing and furniture sales of clothing and footwear slowed further as warm weather hit sales of winter items .
however , food and drink sales rose and halloween sales were strong .
but sales of big-ticket items like televisions were weak , with consumers opting for small items and essentials .
and the decline in the housing market hurt furniture and carpet sales .
consumers appeared to be " cautious , " the brc said , and were " increasingly prepared to wait for bargains " with so many promotions and discounts available on the high street .
mixed picture retailers are hoping that sales will pick up in the crucial period running up to christmas , but there are concerns that they will be forced to begin sales early .
" as the christmas peak gets later each year , the big questions out there are how much extra promotional activity will be required to drive the christmas numbers , and who will lose their nerve and bring their sale forward , " said amanda aldridge , of consultants kpmg .
so far retailers have reported mixed results , with a tough year for argos and homebase but better profits for marks and spencer .
other figures also suggest some improvement in the retail climate .
official retail figures showed an increase of 0.7 % in september , while the cbi reported last week that retail sales volumes had fallen less than forecast .
the mixed picture is likely to contribute to the bank of england keeping interest rates on hold when it announces its latest decision later this week .
retailers are still hoping that a rate cut in the new year , however , could help boost sales .
