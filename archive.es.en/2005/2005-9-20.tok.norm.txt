but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .

that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .
twenty-six would like to see the cdu / csu , fdp and greens take the reins of government , and less than one-fifth want the spd , fdp and greens to rule .
only 9 percent spoke out in favor of an spd , green , left party coalition . but gerhard schröder does have one thing right : half of those polled want him to remain germany 's chancellor in a grand coalition , and 43 percent are in favor of angela merkel in that position . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .
twenty-six would like to see the cdu / csu , fdp and greens take the reins of government , and less than one-fifth want the spd , fdp and greens to rule .
only 9 percent spoke out in favor of an spd , green , left party coalition . but gerhard schröder does have one thing right : half of those polled want him to remain germany 's chancellor in a grand coalition , and 43 percent are in favor of angela merkel in that position . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

seems quite an unlikely inspiration for a political grouping in germany , where clouds loom heavy and often , dispositions are gloomier than glad , and the oompah-band tuba drowns out the steel drum . " you can imagine what i was seeing , " said green foreign minister joschka fischer , referring to the first time he actually heard the term .
" i saw people sitting around in dreadlocks with joints in their hands , and reggae music playing in the background . "
and at first , he was not impressed .
besides , he said , " can you imagine angela merkel or edmund stoiber with dreadlocks ? " indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.09.2005 book fair expecting record participation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt convention center will be buzzing in about a month the frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest convention for the publishing , multimedia , and communications sectors , is gearing up for the annual five-day event with south korea as guest . from oct .
19th to the 23rd , the financial center on the main river will play host to the world 's largest trade fair for the publishing industry .
for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .
" our guest country will present itself at the book fair , in the city , and across germany with a broad program ranging from literature to visual arts . " more than a book fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair : more than just books not just a literary convention , the book fair 's korean guests will use the open area of the frankfurt convention center grounds to showcase other aspects of korean culture , such as korean dance , martial arts , and korean cuisine . jürgen boos is hopeful that the high-profile fair will increase interest in translating korean literature into german .
" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .
" with a 6 percent growth rate , the frankfurt book fair is one of the few leading trade fairs in the world that continues to grow , " said boos at a press conference on tuesday .
presenters from over 100 countries are expected to attend this year 's event . the frankfurt book fair is also collaborating with the " reading country : hesse " festival , organized by the hessian ministry of arts and sciences . important for publishers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's largest trade fair of its kind : the frankfurt book fair not just a book fair for the general public , the frankfurt book fair also has strategic importance to publishing professionals .

19th to the 23rd , the financial center on the main river will play host to the world 's largest trade fair for the publishing industry .
for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .
" our guest country will present itself at the book fair , in the city , and across germany with a broad program ranging from literature to visual arts . " more than a book fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair : more than just books not just a literary convention , the book fair 's korean guests will use the open area of the frankfurt convention center grounds to showcase other aspects of korean culture , such as korean dance , martial arts , and korean cuisine . jürgen boos is hopeful that the high-profile fair will increase interest in translating korean literature into german .
" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .
" with a 6 percent growth rate , the frankfurt book fair is one of the few leading trade fairs in the world that continues to grow , " said boos at a press conference on tuesday .
presenters from over 100 countries are expected to attend this year 's event . the frankfurt book fair is also collaborating with the " reading country : hesse " festival , organized by the hessian ministry of arts and sciences . important for publishers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's largest trade fair of its kind : the frankfurt book fair not just a book fair for the general public , the frankfurt book fair also has strategic importance to publishing professionals .
in catering to the specialized crowd , boos has overseen a variety of new exhibition areas within the overall trade fair . " this year we have placed a lot of importance on increasing our offering of information for the publishing branch , " boos said .
new exhibition areas include the antique book sellers area , the " pressemesse , " a gaming exhibit called " spiele und spielen , " and forums on textbooks and publishing house production .
the focus area " film and tv , " popular with past fairs , will be continued with offerings for film producers and publishing house employees . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt the birthplace of goethe and the location for the first german parliament , frankfurt is a historically and culturally rich city .

does anyone have a chance at unseating them as champions ? the 1-0 win against hanover was nothing pretty , something even captain oliver kahn was ready to admit .
" i guess that 's what you would call a workmanlike victory , " he said , following a game which featured few goal shots and a hanover team that played defensively virtually the entire time .

does anyone have a chance at unseating them as champions ? the 1-0 win against hanover was nothing pretty , something even captain oliver kahn was ready to admit .
" i guess that 's what you would call a workmanlike victory , " he said , following a game which featured few goal shots and a hanover team that played defensively virtually the entire time .
but the win meant something special for bayern munich , germany 's most decorated club .
their 14 wins in a row are a bundesliga record , breaking the 13-win run by - guess who ? - bayern munich in 1981 . in fact , the run seems to only confirm what many are thinking -lrb- fearing ? -rrb- at the moment - that bayern munich , last year 's champion , are unstoppable in the bundesliga .
it 's not just the fact that they are winning , it 's how they are winning . winning even without ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's ankle injury has kept him out of the last two games dutch striker roy makaay has started the season with a bang , tearing off six goals in the first five games .
even without star michael ballack , who controls and directs bayern 's attack from midfield but has been injured for the last two matches , the munich team has enough reserves to shut down seemingly any bundesliga competitor . the comment from trainer felix magath that " we 're not playing at our level at the moment " is likely to send more chills down the spines of bundesliga 's champions-in-waiting .
of the top three teams behind bayern at the moment , only werder bremen , 2004 's champions , seem like serious competition .
the team under trainer thomas schaaf has an uncanny ability to rebound from the loss of key position players to bigger , more moneyed teams each year .
the team plays smooth , high-scoring soccer that keeps them near the top of the table .
schalke 's slow start schalke 04 , which invested tens of millions of euros ahead of this season with the expressed purpose of taking the crown away from bayern has so far seen little return .
after some attractive soccer at the beginning , ralf rangnick 's team has faltered in recent weeks .
they have managed only ties against borussia mönchengladbach , bayer leverkusen and hertha berlin - none of which is having particularly good starts to their seasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick 's side has had a less-than-stellar start rangnick said in an interview that his team can only unseat bayern " if we play to our absolute limit and bayern has a moment of two of weakness .
at the moment , we 're weak . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen stick with record breaking bayern bayern munich set a new record of 14 successive bundesliga wins on saturday with a 1-0 triumph over hanover at the allianz arena but werder bremen kept the pressure on the champions with a 3-2 victory over dortmund .
-lrb- sept .
19 , 2005 -rrb- is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .
-lrb- sept .
13 , 2005 -rrb- how soon before ballack moves abroad ?
following a sterling confederations cup performance the rumor mill is hot with transfer talks concerning germany 's only real soccer star .
but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ?

he was 96 . wiesenthal , who died after a long illness , helped bring more than 1,100 nazi criminals to justice , according to the simon wiesenthal center , which did not give the cause of his death . rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the los angeles-based center , described wiesenthal as " the conscience of the holocaust . " " when the holocaust ended in 1945 and the whole world went home to forget , he alone remained behind to remember , " hier said in a statement .
" he did not forget .
he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
a survivor born in 1908 in the town of buchach in what is now ukraine , wiesenthal practiced architecture prior to world war ii , when he was twice imprisoned in nazi concentration camps , in 1941-43 and 1944-45 .
wiesenthal was freed by american soldiers from the camp at mauthausen in central austria in may 1945 , but 89 members of his and his wife 's family were killed , among them his mother , stepfather and stepbrother , in the nazi genocide . he founded the jewish documentation center in vienna two years after the end of the war and in 1977 helped set up the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles to fight bigotry and anti-semitism worldwide .

wiesenthal played an important part in helping the israeli secret service track down adolf eichmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , the architect of the nazis ' " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jewish population .
eichmann was seized by israeli agents in argentina and taken to israel to be tried .
he was executed there in 1961 . wiesenthal 's unrelenting hunt for the perpetrators of the holocaust also unearthed ss leader erich rajakowitsch , eichmann 's representative in the netherlands ; franz stangl , the commander of treblinka death camp ; and karl silberbauer , who was responsible for anne frank 's arrest . the simon wiesenthal center continues to search for former nazis who have avoided prosecution .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .
contrary to pollsters ' predictions , germans did n't vote for a change in government .
a grand coalition is the only way out of the mess , says deutsche welle 's uta thofern .

by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .
according to the constitution , the new parliament must meet by the aforementioned date , 30 days after the election .

theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .

if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .
contrary to pollsters ' predictions , germans did n't vote for a change in government .
a grand coalition is the only way out of the mess , says deutsche welle 's uta thofern .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish foreign minister dermot ahern , left , and cypriot foreign minister george iacovou attend the first round table meeting during an eu foreign ministers meeting in newport , wales , thursday sept .
1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .
after initial skepticism , the number of voices in favor of a grand coalition under merkel 's leadership have increased in the union parties .
conversely , fewer seem to favor a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the free-market liberal free democrats and the green party . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's electoral circus americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .
after initial skepticism , the number of voices in favor of a grand coalition under merkel 's leadership have increased in the union parties .
conversely , fewer seem to favor a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the free-market liberal free democrats and the green party . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's electoral circus americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 predicting storms before they strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent storms in the us and europe underline the need for early warnings in the shadow of hurricane katrina , a team of german and british scientists are developing tools to detect early warning signs of storms by studying what triggers them . nothing has struck europe this summer with the force of hurricane katrina .
but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

it underlines yet again there is no alternative to global climate protection .

the faces of a possible jamaica coalition .
the cliché surrounding the island nation of jamaica says it 's all about taking it easy , kicking back , enjoying some ganja .
now jamaica 's come to germany , at least as a possible political grouping .
but is germany ready ? as germany struggles to find a stable coalition government after inconclusive elections on sunday , one of the possible party constellations often mentioned is the " jamaica " one . it 's named after the colors of the parties involved , the christian union bloc -lrb- black -rrb- , the free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and the greens -lrb- well , green -rrb- , which correspond to the colors on the flag of this sun and - the stereotype has it anyway - pot-smoke-drenched caribbean nation . ah , jamaica , where the living is easy , the mood relaxed and the music bob marley inspired .
seems quite an unlikely inspiration for a political grouping in germany , where clouds loom heavy and often , dispositions are gloomier than glad , and the oompah-band tuba drowns out the steel drum . " you can imagine what i was seeing , " said green foreign minister joschka fischer , referring to the first time he actually heard the term .
" i saw people sitting around in dreadlocks with joints in their hands , and reggae music playing in the background . "
and at first , he was not impressed .
besides , he said , " can you imagine angela merkel or edmund stoiber with dreadlocks ? " indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did she have the german media on her side ?
during the discussion , schröder spoke of " media power and media manipulation , " accusing the media of covering the campaigns in a biased manner and disparaging the fact that the media often quoted the pre-election polls , all of which predicted a decisive victory for angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . in his speech after the preliminary election results were announced , schröder told his supporters at the spd headquarters in berlin that his party had done well despite a lack of support from the media . " i am proud of a democratic culture that overcame the power and manipulation of the media , " schröder said to a crowd made up of almost as many journalists as spd voters . journalists strike back president of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- michael konken rejected " decisively the blanket accusation of media manipulation . "
informing the public about the polls before the elections is a duty , which the german media , according to konken , performed professionally and fairly . " in the interest of 70,000 journalists in our country , i am asking the ruling chancellor to take back his accusations , " konken said . communications expert frank brettschneider described schröder 's behavior as " bizarre " and indicative of a " loss of reality paired with a certain amount of megalomania . "
on the other hand , brettschneider said it was possible that schröder 's aggressive demeanor was a calculated attempt at browbeating angela merkel " to secure an advantage for himself and push up the prices for coalition negotiations . " conspiracy theory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rivalry continues not everybody , however , is critical of schröder 's views .
siegfried weischenberg , a german media researcher and former president of the journalists association , believes that the german media , along with polling institutions , did not handle the pre-election polls carefully enough . " large portions of media reports were directed against the spd , " said weischenberg . according to weischenberg , the german media were responsible for trying to motivate the public for a change of government . when media mixes with politics foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate for the greens , echoed schröder 's concerns about the manipulative power of the media and called for more " self-critical reflexion among journalists " during a press conference monday afternoon . the fact that the spd and the greens were able to prove the trend researchers , pollsters and media were wrong , shows that it 's " worth fighting , " he said and added that " 40-year-old yuppies , office managers and editors-in-chief " were not the only ones who decided the political future of the country . polling institutes criticized the respected us polling institute , gallup , on monday added fire to the flames when it questioned the quality of german opinion researchers .
the manager of gallup in germany , gerald wood , said that he considers the fact that german opinion institutes are often close to the political parties a " serious problem . " doris did n't like it germany 's first lady , doris schröder-köpf - herself a former journalist - disapproved of her husband 's belligerent appearance on television . " she told me i should be more statesmanlike , " schröder told his guests of honor at the post-election party .
he quickly pointed out , however , that people expected him to fight .

19th to the 23rd , the financial center on the main river will play host to the world 's largest trade fair for the publishing industry .
for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .
" our guest country will present itself at the book fair , in the city , and across germany with a broad program ranging from literature to visual arts . " more than a book fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair : more than just books not just a literary convention , the book fair 's korean guests will use the open area of the frankfurt convention center grounds to showcase other aspects of korean culture , such as korean dance , martial arts , and korean cuisine . jürgen boos is hopeful that the high-profile fair will increase interest in translating korean literature into german .
" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .
" with a 6 percent growth rate , the frankfurt book fair is one of the few leading trade fairs in the world that continues to grow , " said boos at a press conference on tuesday .
presenters from over 100 countries are expected to attend this year 's event . the frankfurt book fair is also collaborating with the " reading country : hesse " festival , organized by the hessian ministry of arts and sciences . important for publishers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's largest trade fair of its kind : the frankfurt book fair not just a book fair for the general public , the frankfurt book fair also has strategic importance to publishing professionals .
in catering to the specialized crowd , boos has overseen a variety of new exhibition areas within the overall trade fair . " this year we have placed a lot of importance on increasing our offering of information for the publishing branch , " boos said .
new exhibition areas include the antique book sellers area , the " pressemesse , " a gaming exhibit called " spiele und spielen , " and forums on textbooks and publishing house production .
the focus area " film and tv , " popular with past fairs , will be continued with offerings for film producers and publishing house employees . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt the birthplace of goethe and the location for the first german parliament , frankfurt is a historically and culturally rich city .

schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "

but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .

therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .
contrary to pollsters ' predictions , germans did n't vote for a change in government .

by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .

theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .

if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .
if he or she does not have 307 votes or more , köhler must make a decision : either he appoints the chancellor at the head of a minority government , also within seven days , or he dissolves parliament and calls new elections - a situation that is without precedent in german postwar history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "

merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .

in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .

theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .
to be elected , the candidate in this round must also win 307 votes .

if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish foreign minister dermot ahern , left , and cypriot foreign minister george iacovou attend the first round table meeting during an eu foreign ministers meeting in newport , wales , thursday sept .
1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

20 , a holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to the often lonely mission of hunting nazi war criminals , leaves a rich legacy for the notion of justice and of the responsibility of civilization to not overlook or forget atrocities against humanity .
around the world , leaders paid their respects to a relentless champion for justice , the dignity of the jewish people and the obligation of civilized society to hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable .
paul spiegel , chairman of the jewish central council in germany , called wiesenthal 's death a great loss and israeli president mosche katzav said wiesenthal was the very embodiment of human decency .
" simon wiesenthal was the conscience of the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the wiesenthal center , the international human-rights ngo that was his namesake . " he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
german president horst köhler said wiesenthal 's life work had nothing to do with revenge , but with justice .
real jewish hero the director of the wiesenthal center in jerusalem , ephraim zuroff , described him as a " real jewish hero " and praised those continuing to work to bring war criminals to justice .
rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon weisenthal center , described how " the world was busy with the cold war and jewish leaders were saying it 's time to forgive and forget , but he knew his mission . "
" i think he gave a tremendous gift to younger generations of germans and austrians by focusing on and helping them to focus on personal responsibility and convicting the criminals , understanding what took place and not giving the mark of cain to the german nation , " he added .
rabbi cooper says wiesenthal 's legacy is even broader in terms of preventing future atrocities . " wiesenthal would always say , ' we do n't know as we speak if tomorrow 's mass murderers are n't already born and are n't looking to see how the civilized world deals with the previous crimes . " '

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .
after initial skepticism , the number of voices in favor of a grand coalition under merkel 's leadership have increased in the union parties .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .

this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

the it services subsidiary sbs would be particularly hard hit : 2,400 jobs , or one in six , would come under the axe . " it comes down to the long-term stability of this corporation , " explained siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld in munich .
" in order to achieve this , it is essential that we cut 2,400 jobs in the next two years in germany , " he said . the siemens ag , which employs 160,000 people in germany , is hoping to cut costs at its problem child siemens business service -lrb- sms -rrb- by 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8.billion -rrb- by 2007 .
the 63 locations in germany would need to be cut " on the scale of about 20 , " according to kleinfeld .
sbs was responsible for 260 million euros in losses in the first 9 months of the fiscal year . kleinfeld underscored his goal of making even the struggling divisions perform with profit and growth .
only then could the overall business be successful in creating and securing jobs , he said . logistics branch to suffer losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angestellte laufen am montag , 19 .

-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- - workers walk through an entrance of a siemens factory in munich , southern germany , on monday , sept .
19 , 2005 .
german industrial conglomerate siemens ag said monday it will cut more than 2,400 jobs at its computer services unit and reorganize two other divisions to stem their mounting losses .
-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- in addition to shutting down one third of the sbs locations , siemens will also liquidate its logistics dividsion l & a , which has failed to turn profits .
profitable departments of both this division and the struggling com communications divison will be integrated into other divisions , albeit with significant job cuts . the distribution and industrial logistics branch of l & a , with 5,000 employees , will be integrated to the independent daughter company dematic gmbh .
the remaining business , with an additional 5,000 employees , will be divided between the divisions industrial solutions and automation technology . following the news of cost-cutting measures , the siemens stock rose at first , then took a downwards path , ending at 63,70 euro , slightly better than the market average . bildunterschrift : siemens , germany 's largest electronics corporation ig metall up in arms germany 's largest industrial union , ig metall , lambasted kleinfeld 's savings scheme , calling it a " horror packet " .
the head of bavarian ig metall , werner neugebauer , criticized siemens ' " conception-less cost cutting " .
at siemens , according to neugebauer , a sustainable corporate development plan was being increasingly sacrificed in the name of short-term profits . " to cut costs , you throw the people out , and that then is your concept , " said neugebauer .
wolfgang müller , who represents ig metall in the siemens supervisory board , was estimating yet greater cuts at sbs than orignially announced : 41 of the 63 locations would be shut down , he said . economic analysts , meanwhile , praised kleinfeld 's drastic measures , calling it a reasonable plan .
a london analyst said , " i think it 's a step in the right direction , " though it would still be difficult to save 1.5 billion euros by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld kleinfeld denied accusations that siemens had delayed the announcement of far-reaching cuts until after the bundestag election in order to help angela merkel and the cdu 's chances .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did she have the german media on her side ?
during the discussion , schröder spoke of " media power and media manipulation , " accusing the media of covering the campaigns in a biased manner and disparaging the fact that the media often quoted the pre-election polls , all of which predicted a decisive victory for angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . in his speech after the preliminary election results were announced , schröder told his supporters at the spd headquarters in berlin that his party had done well despite a lack of support from the media . " i am proud of a democratic culture that overcame the power and manipulation of the media , " schröder said to a crowd made up of almost as many journalists as spd voters . journalists strike back president of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- michael konken rejected " decisively the blanket accusation of media manipulation . "
informing the public about the polls before the elections is a duty , which the german media , according to konken , performed professionally and fairly . " in the interest of 70,000 journalists in our country , i am asking the ruling chancellor to take back his accusations , " konken said . communications expert frank brettschneider described schröder 's behavior as " bizarre " and indicative of a " loss of reality paired with a certain amount of megalomania . "
on the other hand , brettschneider said it was possible that schröder 's aggressive demeanor was a calculated attempt at browbeating angela merkel " to secure an advantage for himself and push up the prices for coalition negotiations . " conspiracy theory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rivalry continues not everybody , however , is critical of schröder 's views .
siegfried weischenberg , a german media researcher and former president of the journalists association , believes that the german media , along with polling institutions , did not handle the pre-election polls carefully enough . " large portions of media reports were directed against the spd , " said weischenberg . according to weischenberg , the german media were responsible for trying to motivate the public for a change of government . when media mixes with politics foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate for the greens , echoed schröder 's concerns about the manipulative power of the media and called for more " self-critical reflexion among journalists " during a press conference monday afternoon . the fact that the spd and the greens were able to prove the trend researchers , pollsters and media were wrong , shows that it 's " worth fighting , " he said and added that " 40-year-old yuppies , office managers and editors-in-chief " were not the only ones who decided the political future of the country . polling institutes criticized the respected us polling institute , gallup , on monday added fire to the flames when it questioned the quality of german opinion researchers .
the manager of gallup in germany , gerald wood , said that he considers the fact that german opinion institutes are often close to the political parties a " serious problem . " doris did n't like it germany 's first lady , doris schröder-köpf - herself a former journalist - disapproved of her husband 's belligerent appearance on television . " she told me i should be more statesmanlike , " schröder told his guests of honor at the post-election party .
he quickly pointed out , however , that people expected him to fight .

during the discussion , schröder spoke of " media power and media manipulation , " accusing the media of covering the campaigns in a biased manner and disparaging the fact that the media often quoted the pre-election polls , all of which predicted a decisive victory for angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . in his speech after the preliminary election results were announced , schröder told his supporters at the spd headquarters in berlin that his party had done well despite a lack of support from the media . " i am proud of a democratic culture that overcame the power and manipulation of the media , " schröder said to a crowd made up of almost as many journalists as spd voters . journalists strike back president of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- michael konken rejected " decisively the blanket accusation of media manipulation . "
informing the public about the polls before the elections is a duty , which the german media , according to konken , performed professionally and fairly . " in the interest of 70,000 journalists in our country , i am asking the ruling chancellor to take back his accusations , " konken said . communications expert frank brettschneider described schröder 's behavior as " bizarre " and indicative of a " loss of reality paired with a certain amount of megalomania . "
on the other hand , brettschneider said it was possible that schröder 's aggressive demeanor was a calculated attempt at browbeating angela merkel " to secure an advantage for himself and push up the prices for coalition negotiations . " conspiracy theory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rivalry continues not everybody , however , is critical of schröder 's views .
siegfried weischenberg , a german media researcher and former president of the journalists association , believes that the german media , along with polling institutions , did not handle the pre-election polls carefully enough . " large portions of media reports were directed against the spd , " said weischenberg . according to weischenberg , the german media were responsible for trying to motivate the public for a change of government . when media mixes with politics foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate for the greens , echoed schröder 's concerns about the manipulative power of the media and called for more " self-critical reflexion among journalists " during a press conference monday afternoon . the fact that the spd and the greens were able to prove the trend researchers , pollsters and media were wrong , shows that it 's " worth fighting , " he said and added that " 40-year-old yuppies , office managers and editors-in-chief " were not the only ones who decided the political future of the country . polling institutes criticized the respected us polling institute , gallup , on monday added fire to the flames when it questioned the quality of german opinion researchers .
the manager of gallup in germany , gerald wood , said that he considers the fact that german opinion institutes are often close to the political parties a " serious problem . " doris did n't like it germany 's first lady , doris schröder-köpf - herself a former journalist - disapproved of her husband 's belligerent appearance on television . " she told me i should be more statesmanlike , " schröder told his guests of honor at the post-election party .
he quickly pointed out , however , that people expected him to fight . " and that 's what i did , " schröder said , accompanied by a tumultuous applause . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press says schröder won newspaper editors were almost unanimous that chancellor schröder won sunday 's long-awaited debate against challenger angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 germany leans left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of " social coldness " helped schröder do as well as he did although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .
twenty-six would like to see the cdu / csu , fdp and greens take the reins of government , and less than one-fifth want the spd , fdp and greens to rule .
only 9 percent spoke out in favor of an spd , green , left party coalition . but gerhard schröder does have one thing right : half of those polled want him to remain germany 's chancellor in a grand coalition , and 43 percent are in favor of angela merkel in that position . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

the inconclusive poll has left schröder and merkel jockeying for power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 germany leans left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of " social coldness " helped schröder do as well as he did although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .

the faces of a possible jamaica coalition .
the cliché surrounding the island nation of jamaica says it 's all about taking it easy , kicking back , enjoying some ganja .
now jamaica 's come to germany , at least as a possible political grouping .
but is germany ready ? as germany struggles to find a stable coalition government after inconclusive elections on sunday , one of the possible party constellations often mentioned is the " jamaica " one . it 's named after the colors of the parties involved , the christian union bloc -lrb- black -rrb- , the free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and the greens -lrb- well , green -rrb- , which correspond to the colors on the flag of this sun and - the stereotype has it anyway - pot-smoke-drenched caribbean nation . ah , jamaica , where the living is easy , the mood relaxed and the music bob marley inspired .
seems quite an unlikely inspiration for a political grouping in germany , where clouds loom heavy and often , dispositions are gloomier than glad , and the oompah-band tuba drowns out the steel drum . " you can imagine what i was seeing , " said green foreign minister joschka fischer , referring to the first time he actually heard the term .
" i saw people sitting around in dreadlocks with joints in their hands , and reggae music playing in the background . "
and at first , he was not impressed .
besides , he said , " can you imagine angela merkel or edmund stoiber with dreadlocks ? " indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?

that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .

18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "

the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did she have the german media on her side ?
during the discussion , schröder spoke of " media power and media manipulation , " accusing the media of covering the campaigns in a biased manner and disparaging the fact that the media often quoted the pre-election polls , all of which predicted a decisive victory for angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . in his speech after the preliminary election results were announced , schröder told his supporters at the spd headquarters in berlin that his party had done well despite a lack of support from the media . " i am proud of a democratic culture that overcame the power and manipulation of the media , " schröder said to a crowd made up of almost as many journalists as spd voters . journalists strike back president of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- michael konken rejected " decisively the blanket accusation of media manipulation . "
informing the public about the polls before the elections is a duty , which the german media , according to konken , performed professionally and fairly . " in the interest of 70,000 journalists in our country , i am asking the ruling chancellor to take back his accusations , " konken said . communications expert frank brettschneider described schröder 's behavior as " bizarre " and indicative of a " loss of reality paired with a certain amount of megalomania . "
on the other hand , brettschneider said it was possible that schröder 's aggressive demeanor was a calculated attempt at browbeating angela merkel " to secure an advantage for himself and push up the prices for coalition negotiations .

the manager of gallup in germany , gerald wood , said that he considers the fact that german opinion institutes are often close to the political parties a " serious problem . " doris did n't like it germany 's first lady , doris schröder-köpf - herself a former journalist - disapproved of her husband 's belligerent appearance on television . " she told me i should be more statesmanlike , " schröder told his guests of honor at the post-election party .
he quickly pointed out , however , that people expected him to fight .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .
after initial skepticism , the number of voices in favor of a grand coalition under merkel 's leadership have increased in the union parties .
conversely , fewer seem to favor a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the free-market liberal free democrats and the green party . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's electoral circus americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .

the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 20.09.2005 what next after german political stalemate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both have their sights trained on the chancellory the inconclusive poll has left schröder and merkel jockeying for power .
by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .
according to the constitution , the new parliament must meet by the aforementioned date , 30 days after the election .
the oldest member of parliament opens the first session , during which the chancellor is traditionally named .
spotlight on the german president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler this is also where the german president , horst köhler , steps in . in the first round of voting , köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- must name a chancellor candidate - and not necessarily from the strongest group in parliament .
theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .
to be elected , the candidate in this round must also win 307 votes .
a new round of elections ?
if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .
if he or she does not have 307 votes or more , köhler must make a decision : either he appoints the chancellor at the head of a minority government , also within seven days , or he dissolves parliament and calls new elections - a situation that is without precedent in german postwar history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .
according to the constitution , the new parliament must meet by the aforementioned date , 30 days after the election .
the oldest member of parliament opens the first session , during which the chancellor is traditionally named .
spotlight on the german president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler this is also where the german president , horst köhler , steps in . in the first round of voting , köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- must name a chancellor candidate - and not necessarily from the strongest group in parliament .
theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .
to be elected , the candidate in this round must also win 307 votes .
a new round of elections ?
if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .
if he or she does not have 307 votes or more , köhler must make a decision : either he appoints the chancellor at the head of a minority government , also within seven days , or he dissolves parliament and calls new elections - a situation that is without precedent in german postwar history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

20 , a holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to the often lonely mission of hunting nazi war criminals , leaves a rich legacy for the notion of justice and of the responsibility of civilization to not overlook or forget atrocities against humanity .
around the world , leaders paid their respects to a relentless champion for justice , the dignity of the jewish people and the obligation of civilized society to hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable .
paul spiegel , chairman of the jewish central council in germany , called wiesenthal 's death a great loss and israeli president mosche katzav said wiesenthal was the very embodiment of human decency .
" simon wiesenthal was the conscience of the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the wiesenthal center , the international human-rights ngo that was his namesake . " he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
german president horst köhler said wiesenthal 's life work had nothing to do with revenge , but with justice .
real jewish hero the director of the wiesenthal center in jerusalem , ephraim zuroff , described him as a " real jewish hero " and praised those continuing to work to bring war criminals to justice .
rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon weisenthal center , described how " the world was busy with the cold war and jewish leaders were saying it 's time to forgive and forget , but he knew his mission . "
" i think he gave a tremendous gift to younger generations of germans and austrians by focusing on and helping them to focus on personal responsibility and convicting the criminals , understanding what took place and not giving the mark of cain to the german nation , " he added .
rabbi cooper says wiesenthal 's legacy is even broader in terms of preventing future atrocities . " wiesenthal would always say , ' we do n't know as we speak if tomorrow 's mass murderers are n't already born and are n't looking to see how the civilized world deals with the previous crimes . " '
" if we speak today about situations like rwanda and darfur - none of that would have taken place without the courageous and obstinate leadership of simon wiesenthal , " said rabbi cooper . dw-staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish manhunt for nazi continues one of the most sadistic nazi doctors during the third reich who is suspected of hundreds of murders is still on the run in spain .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .

19th to the 23rd , the financial center on the main river will play host to the world 's largest trade fair for the publishing industry .
for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .
" our guest country will present itself at the book fair , in the city , and across germany with a broad program ranging from literature to visual arts . " more than a book fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair : more than just books not just a literary convention , the book fair 's korean guests will use the open area of the frankfurt convention center grounds to showcase other aspects of korean culture , such as korean dance , martial arts , and korean cuisine . jürgen boos is hopeful that the high-profile fair will increase interest in translating korean literature into german .
" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

the faces of a possible jamaica coalition .
the cliché surrounding the island nation of jamaica says it 's all about taking it easy , kicking back , enjoying some ganja .
now jamaica 's come to germany , at least as a possible political grouping .
but is germany ready ? as germany struggles to find a stable coalition government after inconclusive elections on sunday , one of the possible party constellations often mentioned is the " jamaica " one . it 's named after the colors of the parties involved , the christian union bloc -lrb- black -rrb- , the free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and the greens -lrb- well , green -rrb- , which correspond to the colors on the flag of this sun and - the stereotype has it anyway - pot-smoke-drenched caribbean nation . ah , jamaica , where the living is easy , the mood relaxed and the music bob marley inspired .
seems quite an unlikely inspiration for a political grouping in germany , where clouds loom heavy and often , dispositions are gloomier than glad , and the oompah-band tuba drowns out the steel drum . " you can imagine what i was seeing , " said green foreign minister joschka fischer , referring to the first time he actually heard the term .
" i saw people sitting around in dreadlocks with joints in their hands , and reggae music playing in the background . "
and at first , he was not impressed .
besides , he said , " can you imagine angela merkel or edmund stoiber with dreadlocks ? " indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 germany leans left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of " social coldness " helped schröder do as well as he did although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .
twenty-six would like to see the cdu / csu , fdp and greens take the reins of government , and less than one-fifth want the spd , fdp and greens to rule .
only 9 percent spoke out in favor of an spd , green , left party coalition . but gerhard schröder does have one thing right : half of those polled want him to remain germany 's chancellor in a grand coalition , and 43 percent are in favor of angela merkel in that position . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 germany leans left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of " social coldness " helped schröder do as well as he did although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .
twenty-six would like to see the cdu / csu , fdp and greens take the reins of government , and less than one-fifth want the spd , fdp and greens to rule .
only 9 percent spoke out in favor of an spd , green , left party coalition . but gerhard schröder does have one thing right : half of those polled want him to remain germany 's chancellor in a grand coalition , and 43 percent are in favor of angela merkel in that position . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .
contrary to pollsters ' predictions , germans did n't vote for a change in government .
a grand coalition is the only way out of the mess , says deutsche welle 's uta thofern .

schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .

did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .

i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "

but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .

this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did she have the german media on her side ?
during the discussion , schröder spoke of " media power and media manipulation , " accusing the media of covering the campaigns in a biased manner and disparaging the fact that the media often quoted the pre-election polls , all of which predicted a decisive victory for angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . in his speech after the preliminary election results were announced , schröder told his supporters at the spd headquarters in berlin that his party had done well despite a lack of support from the media . " i am proud of a democratic culture that overcame the power and manipulation of the media , " schröder said to a crowd made up of almost as many journalists as spd voters . journalists strike back president of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- michael konken rejected " decisively the blanket accusation of media manipulation . "
informing the public about the polls before the elections is a duty , which the german media , according to konken , performed professionally and fairly . " in the interest of 70,000 journalists in our country , i am asking the ruling chancellor to take back his accusations , " konken said . communications expert frank brettschneider described schröder 's behavior as " bizarre " and indicative of a " loss of reality paired with a certain amount of megalomania . "
on the other hand , brettschneider said it was possible that schröder 's aggressive demeanor was a calculated attempt at browbeating angela merkel " to secure an advantage for himself and push up the prices for coalition negotiations . " conspiracy theory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rivalry continues not everybody , however , is critical of schröder 's views .
siegfried weischenberg , a german media researcher and former president of the journalists association , believes that the german media , along with polling institutions , did not handle the pre-election polls carefully enough . " large portions of media reports were directed against the spd , " said weischenberg . according to weischenberg , the german media were responsible for trying to motivate the public for a change of government . when media mixes with politics foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate for the greens , echoed schröder 's concerns about the manipulative power of the media and called for more " self-critical reflexion among journalists " during a press conference monday afternoon . the fact that the spd and the greens were able to prove the trend researchers , pollsters and media were wrong , shows that it 's " worth fighting , " he said and added that " 40-year-old yuppies , office managers and editors-in-chief " were not the only ones who decided the political future of the country . polling institutes criticized the respected us polling institute , gallup , on monday added fire to the flames when it questioned the quality of german opinion researchers .
the manager of gallup in germany , gerald wood , said that he considers the fact that german opinion institutes are often close to the political parties a " serious problem . " doris did n't like it germany 's first lady , doris schröder-köpf - herself a former journalist - disapproved of her husband 's belligerent appearance on television . " she told me i should be more statesmanlike , " schröder told his guests of honor at the post-election party .
he quickly pointed out , however , that people expected him to fight . " and that 's what i did , " schröder said , accompanied by a tumultuous applause . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press says schröder won newspaper editors were almost unanimous that chancellor schröder won sunday 's long-awaited debate against challenger angela merkel .

he was 96 . wiesenthal , who died after a long illness , helped bring more than 1,100 nazi criminals to justice , according to the simon wiesenthal center , which did not give the cause of his death . rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the los angeles-based center , described wiesenthal as " the conscience of the holocaust . " " when the holocaust ended in 1945 and the whole world went home to forget , he alone remained behind to remember , " hier said in a statement .
" he did not forget .
he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
a survivor born in 1908 in the town of buchach in what is now ukraine , wiesenthal practiced architecture prior to world war ii , when he was twice imprisoned in nazi concentration camps , in 1941-43 and 1944-45 .
wiesenthal was freed by american soldiers from the camp at mauthausen in central austria in may 1945 , but 89 members of his and his wife 's family were killed , among them his mother , stepfather and stepbrother , in the nazi genocide . he founded the jewish documentation center in vienna two years after the end of the war and in 1977 helped set up the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles to fight bigotry and anti-semitism worldwide .

wiesenthal played an important part in helping the israeli secret service track down adolf eichmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , the architect of the nazis ' " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jewish population .
eichmann was seized by israeli agents in argentina and taken to israel to be tried .
he was executed there in 1961 . wiesenthal 's unrelenting hunt for the perpetrators of the holocaust also unearthed ss leader erich rajakowitsch , eichmann 's representative in the netherlands ; franz stangl , the commander of treblinka death camp ; and karl silberbauer , who was responsible for anne frank 's arrest . the simon wiesenthal center continues to search for former nazis who have avoided prosecution .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 predicting storms before they strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent storms in the us and europe underline the need for early warnings in the shadow of hurricane katrina , a team of german and british scientists are developing tools to detect early warning signs of storms by studying what triggers them . nothing has struck europe this summer with the force of hurricane katrina .
but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

it underlines yet again there is no alternative to global climate protection .

the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

19th to the 23rd , the financial center on the main river will play host to the world 's largest trade fair for the publishing industry .
for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .
" our guest country will present itself at the book fair , in the city , and across germany with a broad program ranging from literature to visual arts . " more than a book fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair : more than just books not just a literary convention , the book fair 's korean guests will use the open area of the frankfurt convention center grounds to showcase other aspects of korean culture , such as korean dance , martial arts , and korean cuisine . jürgen boos is hopeful that the high-profile fair will increase interest in translating korean literature into german .
" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .
" with a 6 percent growth rate , the frankfurt book fair is one of the few leading trade fairs in the world that continues to grow , " said boos at a press conference on tuesday .
presenters from over 100 countries are expected to attend this year 's event . the frankfurt book fair is also collaborating with the " reading country : hesse " festival , organized by the hessian ministry of arts and sciences . important for publishers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's largest trade fair of its kind : the frankfurt book fair not just a book fair for the general public , the frankfurt book fair also has strategic importance to publishing professionals .
in catering to the specialized crowd , boos has overseen a variety of new exhibition areas within the overall trade fair . " this year we have placed a lot of importance on increasing our offering of information for the publishing branch , " boos said .
new exhibition areas include the antique book sellers area , the " pressemesse , " a gaming exhibit called " spiele und spielen , " and forums on textbooks and publishing house production .
the focus area " film and tv , " popular with past fairs , will be continued with offerings for film producers and publishing house employees . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt the birthplace of goethe and the location for the first german parliament , frankfurt is a historically and culturally rich city .

the faces of a possible jamaica coalition .
the cliché surrounding the island nation of jamaica says it 's all about taking it easy , kicking back , enjoying some ganja .
now jamaica 's come to germany , at least as a possible political grouping .
but is germany ready ? as germany struggles to find a stable coalition government after inconclusive elections on sunday , one of the possible party constellations often mentioned is the " jamaica " one . it 's named after the colors of the parties involved , the christian union bloc -lrb- black -rrb- , the free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and the greens -lrb- well , green -rrb- , which correspond to the colors on the flag of this sun and - the stereotype has it anyway - pot-smoke-drenched caribbean nation . ah , jamaica , where the living is easy , the mood relaxed and the music bob marley inspired .
seems quite an unlikely inspiration for a political grouping in germany , where clouds loom heavy and often , dispositions are gloomier than glad , and the oompah-band tuba drowns out the steel drum . " you can imagine what i was seeing , " said green foreign minister joschka fischer , referring to the first time he actually heard the term .
" i saw people sitting around in dreadlocks with joints in their hands , and reggae music playing in the background . "
and at first , he was not impressed .
besides , he said , " can you imagine angela merkel or edmund stoiber with dreadlocks ? " indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's path to the eu relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal breaking the mold eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey opinion : merkel 's turkish delight europe -pipe- 20.09.2005 eu reaches deal on turkey-cyprus tangle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recognition of cyprus has been a thorny issue in eu-turkey talks two weeks before accession talks with turkey are set to start , brussels reached a diplomatic breakthrough on ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member state cyprus . european union ambassadors on monday managed to agree on a draft declaration which tells turkey to officially recognize cyprus as a state before it can join the bloc .
the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish foreign minister dermot ahern , left , and cypriot foreign minister george iacovou attend the first round table meeting during an eu foreign ministers meeting in newport , wales , thursday sept .
1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.09.2005 germany gets dreads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : party on , man .
the faces of a possible jamaica coalition .
the cliché surrounding the island nation of jamaica says it 's all about taking it easy , kicking back , enjoying some ganja .
now jamaica 's come to germany , at least as a possible political grouping .
but is germany ready ? as germany struggles to find a stable coalition government after inconclusive elections on sunday , one of the possible party constellations often mentioned is the " jamaica " one . it 's named after the colors of the parties involved , the christian union bloc -lrb- black -rrb- , the free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and the greens -lrb- well , green -rrb- , which correspond to the colors on the flag of this sun and - the stereotype has it anyway - pot-smoke-drenched caribbean nation . ah , jamaica , where the living is easy , the mood relaxed and the music bob marley inspired .
seems quite an unlikely inspiration for a political grouping in germany , where clouds loom heavy and often , dispositions are gloomier than glad , and the oompah-band tuba drowns out the steel drum . " you can imagine what i was seeing , " said green foreign minister joschka fischer , referring to the first time he actually heard the term .
" i saw people sitting around in dreadlocks with joints in their hands , and reggae music playing in the background . "
and at first , he was not impressed .
besides , he said , " can you imagine angela merkel or edmund stoiber with dreadlocks ? " indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 predicting storms before they strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent storms in the us and europe underline the need for early warnings in the shadow of hurricane katrina , a team of german and british scientists are developing tools to detect early warning signs of storms by studying what triggers them . nothing has struck europe this summer with the force of hurricane katrina .
but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .
according to the constitution , the new parliament must meet by the aforementioned date , 30 days after the election .
the oldest member of parliament opens the first session , during which the chancellor is traditionally named .
spotlight on the german president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler this is also where the german president , horst köhler , steps in . in the first round of voting , köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- must name a chancellor candidate - and not necessarily from the strongest group in parliament .
theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .
to be elected , the candidate in this round must also win 307 votes .
a new round of elections ?
if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .
if he or she does not have 307 votes or more , köhler must make a decision : either he appoints the chancellor at the head of a minority government , also within seven days , or he dissolves parliament and calls new elections - a situation that is without precedent in german postwar history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

20 , a holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to the often lonely mission of hunting nazi war criminals , leaves a rich legacy for the notion of justice and of the responsibility of civilization to not overlook or forget atrocities against humanity .
around the world , leaders paid their respects to a relentless champion for justice , the dignity of the jewish people and the obligation of civilized society to hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable .
paul spiegel , chairman of the jewish central council in germany , called wiesenthal 's death a great loss and israeli president mosche katzav said wiesenthal was the very embodiment of human decency .
" simon wiesenthal was the conscience of the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the wiesenthal center , the international human-rights ngo that was his namesake . " he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
german president horst köhler said wiesenthal 's life work had nothing to do with revenge , but with justice .
real jewish hero the director of the wiesenthal center in jerusalem , ephraim zuroff , described him as a " real jewish hero " and praised those continuing to work to bring war criminals to justice .
rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon weisenthal center , described how " the world was busy with the cold war and jewish leaders were saying it 's time to forgive and forget , but he knew his mission . "
" i think he gave a tremendous gift to younger generations of germans and austrians by focusing on and helping them to focus on personal responsibility and convicting the criminals , understanding what took place and not giving the mark of cain to the german nation , " he added .
rabbi cooper says wiesenthal 's legacy is even broader in terms of preventing future atrocities . " wiesenthal would always say , ' we do n't know as we speak if tomorrow 's mass murderers are n't already born and are n't looking to see how the civilized world deals with the previous crimes . " '
" if we speak today about situations like rwanda and darfur - none of that would have taken place without the courageous and obstinate leadership of simon wiesenthal , " said rabbi cooper . dw-staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish manhunt for nazi continues one of the most sadistic nazi doctors during the third reich who is suspected of hundreds of murders is still on the run in spain .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .

he was 96 . wiesenthal , who died after a long illness , helped bring more than 1,100 nazi criminals to justice , according to the simon wiesenthal center , which did not give the cause of his death . rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the los angeles-based center , described wiesenthal as " the conscience of the holocaust . " " when the holocaust ended in 1945 and the whole world went home to forget , he alone remained behind to remember , " hier said in a statement .
" he did not forget .
he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
a survivor born in 1908 in the town of buchach in what is now ukraine , wiesenthal practiced architecture prior to world war ii , when he was twice imprisoned in nazi concentration camps , in 1941-43 and 1944-45 .
wiesenthal was freed by american soldiers from the camp at mauthausen in central austria in may 1945 , but 89 members of his and his wife 's family were killed , among them his mother , stepfather and stepbrother , in the nazi genocide . he founded the jewish documentation center in vienna two years after the end of the war and in 1977 helped set up the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles to fight bigotry and anti-semitism worldwide .

eichmann was seized by israeli agents in argentina and taken to israel to be tried .

besides , he said , " can you imagine angela merkel or edmund stoiber with dreadlocks ? " indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .

by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .
according to the constitution , the new parliament must meet by the aforementioned date , 30 days after the election .
the oldest member of parliament opens the first session , during which the chancellor is traditionally named .
spotlight on the german president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler this is also where the german president , horst köhler , steps in . in the first round of voting , köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- must name a chancellor candidate - and not necessarily from the strongest group in parliament .
theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .
to be elected , the candidate in this round must also win 307 votes .
a new round of elections ?
if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .
if he or she does not have 307 votes or more , köhler must make a decision : either he appoints the chancellor at the head of a minority government , also within seven days , or he dissolves parliament and calls new elections - a situation that is without precedent in german postwar history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 germany leans left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of " social coldness " helped schröder do as well as he did although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .
twenty-six would like to see the cdu / csu , fdp and greens take the reins of government , and less than one-fifth want the spd , fdp and greens to rule .
only 9 percent spoke out in favor of an spd , green , left party coalition . but gerhard schröder does have one thing right : half of those polled want him to remain germany 's chancellor in a grand coalition , and 43 percent are in favor of angela merkel in that position . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .

he was 96 . wiesenthal , who died after a long illness , helped bring more than 1,100 nazi criminals to justice , according to the simon wiesenthal center , which did not give the cause of his death . rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the los angeles-based center , described wiesenthal as " the conscience of the holocaust . " " when the holocaust ended in 1945 and the whole world went home to forget , he alone remained behind to remember , " hier said in a statement .
" he did not forget .
he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
a survivor born in 1908 in the town of buchach in what is now ukraine , wiesenthal practiced architecture prior to world war ii , when he was twice imprisoned in nazi concentration camps , in 1941-43 and 1944-45 .
wiesenthal was freed by american soldiers from the camp at mauthausen in central austria in may 1945 , but 89 members of his and his wife 's family were killed , among them his mother , stepfather and stepbrother , in the nazi genocide . he founded the jewish documentation center in vienna two years after the end of the war and in 1977 helped set up the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles to fight bigotry and anti-semitism worldwide .

wiesenthal played an important part in helping the israeli secret service track down adolf eichmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , the architect of the nazis ' " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jewish population .
eichmann was seized by israeli agents in argentina and taken to israel to be tried .
he was executed there in 1961 . wiesenthal 's unrelenting hunt for the perpetrators of the holocaust also unearthed ss leader erich rajakowitsch , eichmann 's representative in the netherlands ; franz stangl , the commander of treblinka death camp ; and karl silberbauer , who was responsible for anne frank 's arrest . the simon wiesenthal center continues to search for former nazis who have avoided prosecution .

by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .
according to the constitution , the new parliament must meet by the aforementioned date , 30 days after the election .
the oldest member of parliament opens the first session , during which the chancellor is traditionally named .
spotlight on the german president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler this is also where the german president , horst köhler , steps in . in the first round of voting , köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- must name a chancellor candidate - and not necessarily from the strongest group in parliament .
theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .
to be elected , the candidate in this round must also win 307 votes .
a new round of elections ?
if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .
if he or she does not have 307 votes or more , köhler must make a decision : either he appoints the chancellor at the head of a minority government , also within seven days , or he dissolves parliament and calls new elections - a situation that is without precedent in german postwar history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .

the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

20 , a holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to the often lonely mission of hunting nazi war criminals , leaves a rich legacy for the notion of justice and of the responsibility of civilization to not overlook or forget atrocities against humanity .
around the world , leaders paid their respects to a relentless champion for justice , the dignity of the jewish people and the obligation of civilized society to hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable .
paul spiegel , chairman of the jewish central council in germany , called wiesenthal 's death a great loss and israeli president mosche katzav said wiesenthal was the very embodiment of human decency .
" simon wiesenthal was the conscience of the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the wiesenthal center , the international human-rights ngo that was his namesake . " he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
german president horst köhler said wiesenthal 's life work had nothing to do with revenge , but with justice .
real jewish hero the director of the wiesenthal center in jerusalem , ephraim zuroff , described him as a " real jewish hero " and praised those continuing to work to bring war criminals to justice .
rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon weisenthal center , described how " the world was busy with the cold war and jewish leaders were saying it 's time to forgive and forget , but he knew his mission . "
" i think he gave a tremendous gift to younger generations of germans and austrians by focusing on and helping them to focus on personal responsibility and convicting the criminals , understanding what took place and not giving the mark of cain to the german nation , " he added .
rabbi cooper says wiesenthal 's legacy is even broader in terms of preventing future atrocities . " wiesenthal would always say , ' we do n't know as we speak if tomorrow 's mass murderers are n't already born and are n't looking to see how the civilized world deals with the previous crimes . " '
" if we speak today about situations like rwanda and darfur - none of that would have taken place without the courageous and obstinate leadership of simon wiesenthal , " said rabbi cooper . dw-staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish manhunt for nazi continues one of the most sadistic nazi doctors during the third reich who is suspected of hundreds of murders is still on the run in spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 media chancellor turns against media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even schröder 's wife thought he had gone over the top this time following the elections in which the social democrats did much better than anticipated , chancellor gerhard schröder took most observers aback by sharply attacking the media for their alleged bias against his party . editor-in-chief of the german public tv station zdf , nikolaus brender , who co-moderated the post-election debate with leaders of the six main parties , said on monday that schröder 's " style and form " during the debate on sunday night were at times fully inappropriate for a german chancellor , but expressed a modicum of understanding for somebody " who has just descended from the orbit of election campaigning . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did she have the german media on her side ?
during the discussion , schröder spoke of " media power and media manipulation , " accusing the media of covering the campaigns in a biased manner and disparaging the fact that the media often quoted the pre-election polls , all of which predicted a decisive victory for angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . in his speech after the preliminary election results were announced , schröder told his supporters at the spd headquarters in berlin that his party had done well despite a lack of support from the media . " i am proud of a democratic culture that overcame the power and manipulation of the media , " schröder said to a crowd made up of almost as many journalists as spd voters . journalists strike back president of the german journalists association -lrb- djv -rrb- michael konken rejected " decisively the blanket accusation of media manipulation . "
informing the public about the polls before the elections is a duty , which the german media , according to konken , performed professionally and fairly . " in the interest of 70,000 journalists in our country , i am asking the ruling chancellor to take back his accusations , " konken said . communications expert frank brettschneider described schröder 's behavior as " bizarre " and indicative of a " loss of reality paired with a certain amount of megalomania . "
on the other hand , brettschneider said it was possible that schröder 's aggressive demeanor was a calculated attempt at browbeating angela merkel " to secure an advantage for himself and push up the prices for coalition negotiations . " conspiracy theory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rivalry continues not everybody , however , is critical of schröder 's views .
siegfried weischenberg , a german media researcher and former president of the journalists association , believes that the german media , along with polling institutions , did not handle the pre-election polls carefully enough . " large portions of media reports were directed against the spd , " said weischenberg . according to weischenberg , the german media were responsible for trying to motivate the public for a change of government . when media mixes with politics foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate for the greens , echoed schröder 's concerns about the manipulative power of the media and called for more " self-critical reflexion among journalists " during a press conference monday afternoon . the fact that the spd and the greens were able to prove the trend researchers , pollsters and media were wrong , shows that it 's " worth fighting , " he said and added that " 40-year-old yuppies , office managers and editors-in-chief " were not the only ones who decided the political future of the country . polling institutes criticized the respected us polling institute , gallup , on monday added fire to the flames when it questioned the quality of german opinion researchers .
the manager of gallup in germany , gerald wood , said that he considers the fact that german opinion institutes are often close to the political parties a " serious problem . " doris did n't like it germany 's first lady , doris schröder-köpf - herself a former journalist - disapproved of her husband 's belligerent appearance on television . " she told me i should be more statesmanlike , " schröder told his guests of honor at the post-election party .
he quickly pointed out , however , that people expected him to fight . " and that 's what i did , " schröder said , accompanied by a tumultuous applause . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press says schröder won newspaper editors were almost unanimous that chancellor schröder won sunday 's long-awaited debate against challenger angela merkel .

for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .
" our guest country will present itself at the book fair , in the city , and across germany with a broad program ranging from literature to visual arts .

" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .
" with a 6 percent growth rate , the frankfurt book fair is one of the few leading trade fairs in the world that continues to grow , " said boos at a press conference on tuesday .
presenters from over 100 countries are expected to attend this year 's event . the frankfurt book fair is also collaborating with the " reading country : hesse " festival , organized by the hessian ministry of arts and sciences . important for publishers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's largest trade fair of its kind : the frankfurt book fair not just a book fair for the general public , the frankfurt book fair also has strategic importance to publishing professionals .
in catering to the specialized crowd , boos has overseen a variety of new exhibition areas within the overall trade fair . " this year we have placed a lot of importance on increasing our offering of information for the publishing branch , " boos said .
new exhibition areas include the antique book sellers area , the " pressemesse , " a gaming exhibit called " spiele und spielen , " and forums on textbooks and publishing house production .

in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .

" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .
" with a 6 percent growth rate , the frankfurt book fair is one of the few leading trade fairs in the world that continues to grow , " said boos at a press conference on tuesday .

20 , a holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to the often lonely mission of hunting nazi war criminals , leaves a rich legacy for the notion of justice and of the responsibility of civilization to not overlook or forget atrocities against humanity .
around the world , leaders paid their respects to a relentless champion for justice , the dignity of the jewish people and the obligation of civilized society to hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable .
paul spiegel , chairman of the jewish central council in germany , called wiesenthal 's death a great loss and israeli president mosche katzav said wiesenthal was the very embodiment of human decency .
" simon wiesenthal was the conscience of the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the wiesenthal center , the international human-rights ngo that was his namesake . " he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
german president horst köhler said wiesenthal 's life work had nothing to do with revenge , but with justice .
real jewish hero the director of the wiesenthal center in jerusalem , ephraim zuroff , described him as a " real jewish hero " and praised those continuing to work to bring war criminals to justice .
rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon weisenthal center , described how " the world was busy with the cold war and jewish leaders were saying it 's time to forgive and forget , but he knew his mission . "
" i think he gave a tremendous gift to younger generations of germans and austrians by focusing on and helping them to focus on personal responsibility and convicting the criminals , understanding what took place and not giving the mark of cain to the german nation , " he added .
rabbi cooper says wiesenthal 's legacy is even broader in terms of preventing future atrocities . " wiesenthal would always say , ' we do n't know as we speak if tomorrow 's mass murderers are n't already born and are n't looking to see how the civilized world deals with the previous crimes . " '
" if we speak today about situations like rwanda and darfur - none of that would have taken place without the courageous and obstinate leadership of simon wiesenthal , " said rabbi cooper . dw-staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish manhunt for nazi continues one of the most sadistic nazi doctors during the third reich who is suspected of hundreds of murders is still on the run in spain .

20 , a holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to the often lonely mission of hunting nazi war criminals , leaves a rich legacy for the notion of justice and of the responsibility of civilization to not overlook or forget atrocities against humanity .
around the world , leaders paid their respects to a relentless champion for justice , the dignity of the jewish people and the obligation of civilized society to hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable .
paul spiegel , chairman of the jewish central council in germany , called wiesenthal 's death a great loss and israeli president mosche katzav said wiesenthal was the very embodiment of human decency .
" simon wiesenthal was the conscience of the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the wiesenthal center , the international human-rights ngo that was his namesake . " he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
german president horst köhler said wiesenthal 's life work had nothing to do with revenge , but with justice .
real jewish hero the director of the wiesenthal center in jerusalem , ephraim zuroff , described him as a " real jewish hero " and praised those continuing to work to bring war criminals to justice .
rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon weisenthal center , described how " the world was busy with the cold war and jewish leaders were saying it 's time to forgive and forget , but he knew his mission . "
" i think he gave a tremendous gift to younger generations of germans and austrians by focusing on and helping them to focus on personal responsibility and convicting the criminals , understanding what took place and not giving the mark of cain to the german nation , " he added .
rabbi cooper says wiesenthal 's legacy is even broader in terms of preventing future atrocities . " wiesenthal would always say , ' we do n't know as we speak if tomorrow 's mass murderers are n't already born and are n't looking to see how the civilized world deals with the previous crimes . " '
" if we speak today about situations like rwanda and darfur - none of that would have taken place without the courageous and obstinate leadership of simon wiesenthal , " said rabbi cooper . dw-staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish manhunt for nazi continues one of the most sadistic nazi doctors during the third reich who is suspected of hundreds of murders is still on the run in spain .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

19th to the 23rd , the financial center on the main river will play host to the world 's largest trade fair for the publishing industry .
for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .
" our guest country will present itself at the book fair , in the city , and across germany with a broad program ranging from literature to visual arts . " more than a book fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair : more than just books not just a literary convention , the book fair 's korean guests will use the open area of the frankfurt convention center grounds to showcase other aspects of korean culture , such as korean dance , martial arts , and korean cuisine . jürgen boos is hopeful that the high-profile fair will increase interest in translating korean literature into german .
" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .
" with a 6 percent growth rate , the frankfurt book fair is one of the few leading trade fairs in the world that continues to grow , " said boos at a press conference on tuesday .
presenters from over 100 countries are expected to attend this year 's event . the frankfurt book fair is also collaborating with the " reading country : hesse " festival , organized by the hessian ministry of arts and sciences . important for publishers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's largest trade fair of its kind : the frankfurt book fair not just a book fair for the general public , the frankfurt book fair also has strategic importance to publishing professionals .
in catering to the specialized crowd , boos has overseen a variety of new exhibition areas within the overall trade fair . " this year we have placed a lot of importance on increasing our offering of information for the publishing branch , " boos said .
new exhibition areas include the antique book sellers area , the " pressemesse , " a gaming exhibit called " spiele und spielen , " and forums on textbooks and publishing house production .
the focus area " film and tv , " popular with past fairs , will be continued with offerings for film producers and publishing house employees . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt the birthplace of goethe and the location for the first german parliament , frankfurt is a historically and culturally rich city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : turkey 's path to the eu relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal breaking the mold eu parliament huffs , but says yes to turkey opinion : merkel 's turkish delight europe -pipe- 20.09.2005 eu reaches deal on turkey-cyprus tangle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recognition of cyprus has been a thorny issue in eu-turkey talks two weeks before accession talks with turkey are set to start , brussels reached a diplomatic breakthrough on ankara 's refusal to recognize eu member state cyprus . european union ambassadors on monday managed to agree on a draft declaration which tells turkey to officially recognize cyprus as a state before it can join the bloc .
the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .
contrary to pollsters ' predictions , germans did n't vote for a change in government .
a grand coalition is the only way out of the mess , says deutsche welle 's uta thofern .
-lrb- sept .
19 2005 who will be the next chancellor ?
the first official preliminary returns show that the conservatives led by angela merkel won more votes than chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd in sunday 's polls .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .
contrary to pollsters ' predictions , germans did n't vote for a change in government .
a grand coalition is the only way out of the mess , says deutsche welle 's uta thofern .

the first official preliminary returns show that the conservatives led by angela merkel won more votes than chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd in sunday 's polls .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "

merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .

by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 predicting storms before they strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent storms in the us and europe underline the need for early warnings in the shadow of hurricane katrina , a team of german and british scientists are developing tools to detect early warning signs of storms by studying what triggers them . nothing has struck europe this summer with the force of hurricane katrina .
but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish foreign minister dermot ahern , left , and cypriot foreign minister george iacovou attend the first round table meeting during an eu foreign ministers meeting in newport , wales , thursday sept .
1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

he was 96 . wiesenthal , who died after a long illness , helped bring more than 1,100 nazi criminals to justice , according to the simon wiesenthal center , which did not give the cause of his death . rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the los angeles-based center , described wiesenthal as " the conscience of the holocaust . " " when the holocaust ended in 1945 and the whole world went home to forget , he alone remained behind to remember , " hier said in a statement .
" he did not forget .
he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
a survivor born in 1908 in the town of buchach in what is now ukraine , wiesenthal practiced architecture prior to world war ii , when he was twice imprisoned in nazi concentration camps , in 1941-43 and 1944-45 .
wiesenthal was freed by american soldiers from the camp at mauthausen in central austria in may 1945 , but 89 members of his and his wife 's family were killed , among them his mother , stepfather and stepbrother , in the nazi genocide . he founded the jewish documentation center in vienna two years after the end of the war and in 1977 helped set up the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles to fight bigotry and anti-semitism worldwide .

wiesenthal played an important part in helping the israeli secret service track down adolf eichmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , the architect of the nazis ' " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jewish population .
eichmann was seized by israeli agents in argentina and taken to israel to be tried .
he was executed there in 1961 . wiesenthal 's unrelenting hunt for the perpetrators of the holocaust also unearthed ss leader erich rajakowitsch , eichmann 's representative in the netherlands ; franz stangl , the commander of treblinka death camp ; and karl silberbauer , who was responsible for anne frank 's arrest . the simon wiesenthal center continues to search for former nazis who have avoided prosecution .

does anyone have a chance at unseating them as champions ? the 1-0 win against hanover was nothing pretty , something even captain oliver kahn was ready to admit .
" i guess that 's what you would call a workmanlike victory , " he said , following a game which featured few goal shots and a hanover team that played defensively virtually the entire time .
but the win meant something special for bayern munich , germany 's most decorated club .
their 14 wins in a row are a bundesliga record , breaking the 13-win run by - guess who ? - bayern munich in 1981 . in fact , the run seems to only confirm what many are thinking -lrb- fearing ? -rrb- at the moment - that bayern munich , last year 's champion , are unstoppable in the bundesliga .
it 's not just the fact that they are winning , it 's how they are winning . winning even without ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's ankle injury has kept him out of the last two games dutch striker roy makaay has started the season with a bang , tearing off six goals in the first five games .
even without star michael ballack , who controls and directs bayern 's attack from midfield but has been injured for the last two matches , the munich team has enough reserves to shut down seemingly any bundesliga competitor . the comment from trainer felix magath that " we 're not playing at our level at the moment " is likely to send more chills down the spines of bundesliga 's champions-in-waiting .
of the top three teams behind bayern at the moment , only werder bremen , 2004 's champions , seem like serious competition .
the team under trainer thomas schaaf has an uncanny ability to rebound from the loss of key position players to bigger , more moneyed teams each year .
the team plays smooth , high-scoring soccer that keeps them near the top of the table .
schalke 's slow start schalke 04 , which invested tens of millions of euros ahead of this season with the expressed purpose of taking the crown away from bayern has so far seen little return .
after some attractive soccer at the beginning , ralf rangnick 's team has faltered in recent weeks .
they have managed only ties against borussia mönchengladbach , bayer leverkusen and hertha berlin - none of which is having particularly good starts to their seasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick 's side has had a less-than-stellar start rangnick said in an interview that his team can only unseat bayern " if we play to our absolute limit and bayern has a moment of two of weakness .

19 , 2005 -rrb- is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 20.09.2005 what next after german political stalemate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both have their sights trained on the chancellory the inconclusive poll has left schröder and merkel jockeying for power .
by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .
according to the constitution , the new parliament must meet by the aforementioned date , 30 days after the election .
the oldest member of parliament opens the first session , during which the chancellor is traditionally named .
spotlight on the german president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler this is also where the german president , horst köhler , steps in . in the first round of voting , köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- must name a chancellor candidate - and not necessarily from the strongest group in parliament .
theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .
to be elected , the candidate in this round must also win 307 votes .
a new round of elections ?
if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .
if he or she does not have 307 votes or more , köhler must make a decision : either he appoints the chancellor at the head of a minority government , also within seven days , or he dissolves parliament and calls new elections - a situation that is without precedent in german postwar history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

he was 96 . wiesenthal , who died after a long illness , helped bring more than 1,100 nazi criminals to justice , according to the simon wiesenthal center , which did not give the cause of his death . rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the los angeles-based center , described wiesenthal as " the conscience of the holocaust . " " when the holocaust ended in 1945 and the whole world went home to forget , he alone remained behind to remember , " hier said in a statement .
" he did not forget .
he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
a survivor born in 1908 in the town of buchach in what is now ukraine , wiesenthal practiced architecture prior to world war ii , when he was twice imprisoned in nazi concentration camps , in 1941-43 and 1944-45 .
wiesenthal was freed by american soldiers from the camp at mauthausen in central austria in may 1945 , but 89 members of his and his wife 's family were killed , among them his mother , stepfather and stepbrother , in the nazi genocide . he founded the jewish documentation center in vienna two years after the end of the war and in 1977 helped set up the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles to fight bigotry and anti-semitism worldwide .

wiesenthal played an important part in helping the israeli secret service track down adolf eichmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , the architect of the nazis ' " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jewish population .
eichmann was seized by israeli agents in argentina and taken to israel to be tried .
he was executed there in 1961 . wiesenthal 's unrelenting hunt for the perpetrators of the holocaust also unearthed ss leader erich rajakowitsch , eichmann 's representative in the netherlands ; franz stangl , the commander of treblinka death camp ; and karl silberbauer , who was responsible for anne frank 's arrest . the simon wiesenthal center continues to search for former nazis who have avoided prosecution .
in 2002 , it launched the campaign " operation last chance " in several european countries , including germany , austria and the baltics , offering cash rewards for information leading to sentencing perpetrators of nazi crimes . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last chance to catch aging nazis the nazi-hunting simon wiesenthal center is making a last ditch effort to track down nazis before they die of old age .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 germany leans left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of " social coldness " helped schröder do as well as he did although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .
twenty-six would like to see the cdu / csu , fdp and greens take the reins of government , and less than one-fifth want the spd , fdp and greens to rule .
only 9 percent spoke out in favor of an spd , green , left party coalition . but gerhard schröder does have one thing right : half of those polled want him to remain germany 's chancellor in a grand coalition , and 43 percent are in favor of angela merkel in that position . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

he was 96 . wiesenthal , who died after a long illness , helped bring more than 1,100 nazi criminals to justice , according to the simon wiesenthal center , which did not give the cause of his death . rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the los angeles-based center , described wiesenthal as " the conscience of the holocaust . " " when the holocaust ended in 1945 and the whole world went home to forget , he alone remained behind to remember , " hier said in a statement .
" he did not forget .
he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
a survivor born in 1908 in the town of buchach in what is now ukraine , wiesenthal practiced architecture prior to world war ii , when he was twice imprisoned in nazi concentration camps , in 1941-43 and 1944-45 .
wiesenthal was freed by american soldiers from the camp at mauthausen in central austria in may 1945 , but 89 members of his and his wife 's family were killed , among them his mother , stepfather and stepbrother , in the nazi genocide . he founded the jewish documentation center in vienna two years after the end of the war and in 1977 helped set up the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles to fight bigotry and anti-semitism worldwide .

wiesenthal played an important part in helping the israeli secret service track down adolf eichmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , the architect of the nazis ' " final solution " - the extermination of europe 's jewish population .
eichmann was seized by israeli agents in argentina and taken to israel to be tried .
he was executed there in 1961 . wiesenthal 's unrelenting hunt for the perpetrators of the holocaust also unearthed ss leader erich rajakowitsch , eichmann 's representative in the netherlands ; franz stangl , the commander of treblinka death camp ; and karl silberbauer , who was responsible for anne frank 's arrest . the simon wiesenthal center continues to search for former nazis who have avoided prosecution .

that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .
twenty-six would like to see the cdu / csu , fdp and greens take the reins of government , and less than one-fifth want the spd , fdp and greens to rule .
only 9 percent spoke out in favor of an spd , green , left party coalition . but gerhard schröder does have one thing right : half of those polled want him to remain germany 's chancellor in a grand coalition , and 43 percent are in favor of angela merkel in that position . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .

the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .
after initial skepticism , the number of voices in favor of a grand coalition under merkel 's leadership have increased in the union parties .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

" indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

during the discussion , schröder spoke of " media power and media manipulation , " accusing the media of covering the campaigns in a biased manner and disparaging the fact that the media often quoted the pre-election polls , all of which predicted a decisive victory for angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and their coalition partner , the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . in his speech after the preliminary election results were announced , schröder told his supporters at the spd headquarters in berlin that his party had done well despite a lack of support from the media .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

but there have been a number of pretty ferocious storms causing extensive flooding and structural damage .
british and german scientists have embarked on a major project to explore and explain the phenomena .
unable to see storms soon enough the convective storm initiation project , a collaboration between academic climatologists and weather forecasters , involves six british universities as well as the german aerospace center and the british weather forecasting service .
peter clarke of the united kingdom meteorological office says the project is designed to study thunderstorms more closely than ever before by improving instrumentation so that activity can be detected before storms take shape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : storm forecasters hope to put make more precise predictions by seeing the storms in the fetal stage .
" at the moment we can see the thunderstorm once it is formed and perhaps we can see the clouds from satellites , but we ca n't see what 's happening before the clouds form , " clarke explained .
detecting storms from pressure pockets the project team has developed a massive new radar system which allows the scientists to see storms forming literally out of thin air .
thunderstorms and tornadoes happen when warm , moist air gets trapped beneath a layer of cooler air - like a lid on a pressure cooker .
so if this layer ruptures , it 's like lifting the lid and warm , wet air rushes up into the cooler atmosphere above .
instantly water vapor condenses as thunder clouds and heavy rain falls directly beneath .
prof. keith browning , director of the convective storm project , explained that the " piece de resistance , " a very large radar , allows them to see more than the average weather radar that sees rain .
indeed , his radar sees clear air features , including the temperature and humidity gradients that reveal the presence of a lid , and can see air rising before it even produces a cloud .
sudden , hard to predict storms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fallen tree represents just modest damage from a storm in frodsham , cheshire , england .
with instruments deployed across the south of england , the project tracked the origins of a storm that rolled northwards and eventually caused a freak tornado in birmingham .
professor browning 's team think they 've identified the triggers - air moving over high ground or cold streams colliding that lift the lid and cause a storm .
instruments like this have allowed scientists to study the summer thunderstorms and tornadoes of 2005 in unprecedented detail .
the 130 mile-per-hour whirlwind that ripped through birmingham in 2005 was relatively small , but it still caused fifty million dollars worth of damage .
there was even more flooding damage in the english seaside town of boscastle in 2004 as well as extensive destruction in north yorkshire in 2005 .
john curtin of the british environment agency said the radar detected these storms too late - after they had already started doing damage - because they developed very quickly from small , low-lying clouds .
so , they greatly rely on the meteorological office for early warning signs , he said .
increasing the radar 's accuracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gale winds in england have caused damage along with flash flooding and freak tornadoes .
the crux of the problem , however , is that the meteorological office ca n't forecast storms on as small a scale as birmingham , boscastle or north yorkshire .
peter clarke is working on computer models which could become the forecasting tools of the future .
on a computer he 's been able to recreate the boscastle floods almost exactly as they occurred .
but , according to clarke , the current models are only good for around 12 kilometers .
these models could n't have predicted the storms in boscastle because such small clouds -lrb- two to three kilometers across -rrb- are n't properly represented in the model , he said .
clarke hopes for better models in ten years time " which will be able to give us perhaps a few hours warning of severe thunderstorms occurring in a particular place . "
he also hopes to increase the models ' accuracy to about five kilometers .
closely monitored , the events triggering summer storms in britain will provide the first reality check for those future forecasting models .
the goal is to predict precisely where the next destructive tornado will touch down and say not just whether it will rain but exactly where and how heavily it will fall . stephen beard -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storm shakes northern europe at least 16 people died , more than 1,000 homes were flooded and hundreds of thousands left without power after violent storms battered northern europe over the weekend , bringing hurricane force winds and heavy rain .

the it services subsidiary sbs would be particularly hard hit : 2,400 jobs , or one in six , would come under the axe . " it comes down to the long-term stability of this corporation , " explained siemens ceo klaus kleinfeld in munich .
" in order to achieve this , it is essential that we cut 2,400 jobs in the next two years in germany , " he said . the siemens ag , which employs 160,000 people in germany , is hoping to cut costs at its problem child siemens business service -lrb- sms -rrb- by 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8.billion -rrb- by 2007 .

-lrb- ap photo / christof stache -rrb- in addition to shutting down one third of the sbs locations , siemens will also liquidate its logistics dividsion l & a , which has failed to turn profits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.09.2005 germany leans left großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of " social coldness " helped schröder do as well as he did although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .
twenty-six would like to see the cdu / csu , fdp and greens take the reins of government , and less than one-fifth want the spd , fdp and greens to rule .
only 9 percent spoke out in favor of an spd , green , left party coalition . but gerhard schröder does have one thing right : half of those polled want him to remain germany 's chancellor in a grand coalition , and 43 percent are in favor of angela merkel in that position . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor . angela merkel 's christian democrats and gerhard schröder 's social democrats both claimed victory for their parties in sunday 's closely fought election , but with 35.2 and 34.3 percent respectively neither party received a clear mandate from the electorate .
but a total of 51.1 percent cast ballots for the three parties to the left of the center , the spd , the green party and the newly formed left party .
only 43.9 percent voted for the conservatives and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but as germany desperately weighs the different possibilities for a governing coalition , the spd , greens and left party have all said there 's no way the three of them will work together .
the social democrats and the greens have stressed they wo n't work with the left party , which , for its part , has said it wo n't tolerate the other two in a minority government .
out in the cold both the spd and the greens galvanized their campaigns by accusing the cdu of a program that would leave people out in the cold , branding the conservatives the " party of social coldness . "
and their strategy seems to have struck a chord with voters .
bildunterschrift : the left party , which got 8.7 percent of the vote , has said it looks forward to being in the oppositive a survey carried out by infratest dimap for public broadcaster ard showed that 42 percent of voters believed the social democrats would ensure social justice , while only 28 percent had confidence that the cdu / csu would do the same .
and social justice was the decisive issue that caused 60 percent of left party voters to cast ballots for the new formation of disgruntled social democrats and former communists .
at the same time , only 17 percent of cdu voters saw social justice as their party 's main strength . so far , the greens have used that argument to reject forming a coalition with the cdu and the fdp . " i ca n't tell people that i 'm fighting to defend our policies , that we do n't want policies -lrb- that cause -rrb- social coldness and ecological regression and later do something entirely different , " green leader and foreign minister joschka fischer said , as he dismissed the possibility of accepting a cabinet post in cooperation with the cdu and fdp .
habits have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but analysts have been saying the results instead reflect a shift in voting habits on the part of the germans . " voters have proven their independence in this election , " pollster richard hilmer from infratest dimap said .
traditional attachments to a particular party have also diminished .
that assessment is supported by a poll that showed that around 70 percent of germans are unhappy with the result of the election .
the telephone survey carried out on monday by the research group wahlen revealed that 33 percent of germans would prefer a grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd .

the faces of a possible jamaica coalition .
the cliché surrounding the island nation of jamaica says it 's all about taking it easy , kicking back , enjoying some ganja .
now jamaica 's come to germany , at least as a possible political grouping .
but is germany ready ? as germany struggles to find a stable coalition government after inconclusive elections on sunday , one of the possible party constellations often mentioned is the " jamaica " one . it 's named after the colors of the parties involved , the christian union bloc -lrb- black -rrb- , the free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and the greens -lrb- well , green -rrb- , which correspond to the colors on the flag of this sun and - the stereotype has it anyway - pot-smoke-drenched caribbean nation . ah , jamaica , where the living is easy , the mood relaxed and the music bob marley inspired .
seems quite an unlikely inspiration for a political grouping in germany , where clouds loom heavy and often , dispositions are gloomier than glad , and the oompah-band tuba drowns out the steel drum . " you can imagine what i was seeing , " said green foreign minister joschka fischer , referring to the first time he actually heard the term .
" i saw people sitting around in dreadlocks with joints in their hands , and reggae music playing in the background . "
and at first , he was not impressed .
besides , he said , " can you imagine angela merkel or edmund stoiber with dreadlocks ? " indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.09.2005 bayern munich 's impressive run großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominating start with workmanlike efficiency , fc bayern munich won their 14th game in a row on sunday .
does anyone have a chance at unseating them as champions ? the 1-0 win against hanover was nothing pretty , something even captain oliver kahn was ready to admit .
" i guess that 's what you would call a workmanlike victory , " he said , following a game which featured few goal shots and a hanover team that played defensively virtually the entire time .
but the win meant something special for bayern munich , germany 's most decorated club .
their 14 wins in a row are a bundesliga record , breaking the 13-win run by - guess who ? - bayern munich in 1981 . in fact , the run seems to only confirm what many are thinking -lrb- fearing ? -rrb- at the moment - that bayern munich , last year 's champion , are unstoppable in the bundesliga .
it 's not just the fact that they are winning , it 's how they are winning . winning even without ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's ankle injury has kept him out of the last two games dutch striker roy makaay has started the season with a bang , tearing off six goals in the first five games .
even without star michael ballack , who controls and directs bayern 's attack from midfield but has been injured for the last two matches , the munich team has enough reserves to shut down seemingly any bundesliga competitor . the comment from trainer felix magath that " we 're not playing at our level at the moment " is likely to send more chills down the spines of bundesliga 's champions-in-waiting .
of the top three teams behind bayern at the moment , only werder bremen , 2004 's champions , seem like serious competition .
the team under trainer thomas schaaf has an uncanny ability to rebound from the loss of key position players to bigger , more moneyed teams each year .
the team plays smooth , high-scoring soccer that keeps them near the top of the table .
schalke 's slow start schalke 04 , which invested tens of millions of euros ahead of this season with the expressed purpose of taking the crown away from bayern has so far seen little return .
after some attractive soccer at the beginning , ralf rangnick 's team has faltered in recent weeks .
they have managed only ties against borussia mönchengladbach , bayer leverkusen and hertha berlin - none of which is having particularly good starts to their seasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick 's side has had a less-than-stellar start rangnick said in an interview that his team can only unseat bayern " if we play to our absolute limit and bayern has a moment of two of weakness .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .

20 , a holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to the often lonely mission of hunting nazi war criminals , leaves a rich legacy for the notion of justice and of the responsibility of civilization to not overlook or forget atrocities against humanity .
around the world , leaders paid their respects to a relentless champion for justice , the dignity of the jewish people and the obligation of civilized society to hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable .
paul spiegel , chairman of the jewish central council in germany , called wiesenthal 's death a great loss and israeli president mosche katzav said wiesenthal was the very embodiment of human decency .
" simon wiesenthal was the conscience of the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the wiesenthal center , the international human-rights ngo that was his namesake . " he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
german president horst köhler said wiesenthal 's life work had nothing to do with revenge , but with justice .
real jewish hero the director of the wiesenthal center in jerusalem , ephraim zuroff , described him as a " real jewish hero " and praised those continuing to work to bring war criminals to justice .
rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon weisenthal center , described how " the world was busy with the cold war and jewish leaders were saying it 's time to forgive and forget , but he knew his mission . "
" i think he gave a tremendous gift to younger generations of germans and austrians by focusing on and helping them to focus on personal responsibility and convicting the criminals , understanding what took place and not giving the mark of cain to the german nation , " he added .
rabbi cooper says wiesenthal 's legacy is even broader in terms of preventing future atrocities . " wiesenthal would always say , ' we do n't know as we speak if tomorrow 's mass murderers are n't already born and are n't looking to see how the civilized world deals with the previous crimes . " '
" if we speak today about situations like rwanda and darfur - none of that would have taken place without the courageous and obstinate leadership of simon wiesenthal , " said rabbi cooper . dw-staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish manhunt for nazi continues one of the most sadistic nazi doctors during the third reich who is suspected of hundreds of murders is still on the run in spain .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .
after initial skepticism , the number of voices in favor of a grand coalition under merkel 's leadership have increased in the union parties .
conversely , fewer seem to favor a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the free-market liberal free democrats and the green party . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's electoral circus americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .
contrary to pollsters ' predictions , germans did n't vote for a change in government .

19th to the 23rd , the financial center on the main river will play host to the world 's largest trade fair for the publishing industry .
for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .
contrary to pollsters ' predictions , germans did n't vote for a change in government .

the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .
after initial skepticism , the number of voices in favor of a grand coalition under merkel 's leadership have increased in the union parties .
conversely , fewer seem to favor a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the free-market liberal free democrats and the green party . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's electoral circus americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .

the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor . following an hour-long meeting with members of her own christian democratic union and the bavarian sister party , the christian social union , merkel was confirmed as parliamentary leader with 98.6 percent of the vote .
the clear show of support - only three of the faction 's 222 members voted against her - smoothes the way for merkel to begin searching for coalition partners to form the next government .
berlin had been abuzz with speculation about what would happen to merkel , who lead the union parties to one of their worst federal election showings in postwar history on sunday .
some observers questioned whether the 51-year-old party leader would have the necessary support to stake her claim as chancellor of germany 's next government .
in the aftermath of sunday 's election , both merkel and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder have claimed germany 's top job .
schröder , whose social democratic party on sunday finished with 34.3 percent of the vote - a much better showing than anticipated - said the conservatives ' poor showing makes him " feel validated " as chancellor . merkel 's leadership reaffirmed in a raucous talk show appearance on sunday night , schröder told merkel as the cameras ran that her conservatives would never be able to form a so-called " grand coalition " with his spd with her as chancellor .
the spd gave parliamentary leader franz müntefering their own show of support , voting to keep him with 95.6 percent of the vote on tuesday . but merkel and the union parties put on a confident display following the party meeting on tuesday . " germany needs a stable government that 's capable of acting , and under angela merkel 's leadership , " said csu chief edmund stoiber .
" and the union fraction … has given her clear support . " " it was a good day for the union parliamentary faction , which is once again ready to work , " said merkel . merkel , whose party won the most votes on sunday , has until oct .
18 to form a government .
after initial skepticism , the number of voices in favor of a grand coalition under merkel 's leadership have increased in the union parties .

the faces of a possible jamaica coalition .
the cliché surrounding the island nation of jamaica says it 's all about taking it easy , kicking back , enjoying some ganja .
now jamaica 's come to germany , at least as a possible political grouping .
but is germany ready ? as germany struggles to find a stable coalition government after inconclusive elections on sunday , one of the possible party constellations often mentioned is the " jamaica " one . it 's named after the colors of the parties involved , the christian union bloc -lrb- black -rrb- , the free democrats -lrb- yellow -rrb- and the greens -lrb- well , green -rrb- , which correspond to the colors on the flag of this sun and - the stereotype has it anyway - pot-smoke-drenched caribbean nation . ah , jamaica , where the living is easy , the mood relaxed and the music bob marley inspired .
seems quite an unlikely inspiration for a political grouping in germany , where clouds loom heavy and often , dispositions are gloomier than glad , and the oompah-band tuba drowns out the steel drum . " you can imagine what i was seeing , " said green foreign minister joschka fischer , referring to the first time he actually heard the term .
" i saw people sitting around in dreadlocks with joints in their hands , and reggae music playing in the background . "
and at first , he was not impressed .
besides , he said , " can you imagine angela merkel or edmund stoiber with dreadlocks ? " indeed , the jamaican lifestyle appears somewhat incongruent to the german parties concerned . it 's hard to picture the fairly white-bread christian center-right and the buttoned-up libertarians of the fdp getting down with some ska , doing a limbo on the beach .
the greens , on the other hand , well , ok . field trip to the island bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sunny isle the jamaicans themselves are taking it all in stride .
" it 's great that everyone 's talking about our country , " marcia gilbert-roberts , the jamaican ambassador to germany , told the financial times deutschland .
" if such a coalition comes to fruition , then we 'll invite all concerned to jamaica . " what they 'd see there though , is not likely a model they 'll want for germany .
laid back and sun soaked as it may be , jamaica also has a darker side .
violent crime on the island is rampant ; the country has the world 's third highest homicide rate .
after dusk , tourists are strongly recommended not to go out of their hotels alone on foot . and come to think of it , is a little bit more of jamaica what germany needs at this point ? analysts have already accused germans of hiding their heads in the sand when it comes to changes the country needs to meet the challenges of globalization .
while a little more joie de vivre certainly would n't hurt the country , smoking a good deal of pot and hanging out on the beach all day is likely not the right recipe to get germany out of the economic morass it 's currently in .
and besides , many green party members are less than enthusiastic about the thought of governing with the cdu or the fdp .
hans-christian ströbele , a green party parliamentarian from berlin , said jamaica was n't really the right term for such a possible partnership , although it was geographically close .
it 's more likely , he said in a television interview , that if the green party got on board that particular boat , they 'd find themselves soon " going under in the bermuda triangle .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .

19th to the 23rd , the financial center on the main river will play host to the world 's largest trade fair for the publishing industry .
for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .

" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .
" with a 6 percent growth rate , the frankfurt book fair is one of the few leading trade fairs in the world that continues to grow , " said boos at a press conference on tuesday .
presenters from over 100 countries are expected to attend this year 's event . the frankfurt book fair is also collaborating with the " reading country : hesse " festival , organized by the hessian ministry of arts and sciences . important for publishers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's largest trade fair of its kind : the frankfurt book fair not just a book fair for the general public , the frankfurt book fair also has strategic importance to publishing professionals .
in catering to the specialized crowd , boos has overseen a variety of new exhibition areas within the overall trade fair . " this year we have placed a lot of importance on increasing our offering of information for the publishing branch , " boos said .
new exhibition areas include the antique book sellers area , the " pressemesse , " a gaming exhibit called " spiele und spielen , " and forums on textbooks and publishing house production .

19th to the 23rd , the financial center on the main river will play host to the world 's largest trade fair for the publishing industry .
for the first time , more than 7,000 individual presenters are expected .
the featured country this year , south korea , has organized more than 5,000 cultural events in all of germany in cooperation with the book fair . jürgen boos , director of the frankfurt book fair , has been involved with the event for over 20 years .
in the past he came to the fair as a presenter or a professional visitor .
now he is in charge of organizing the nearly 3,000 events , including 1,000 author appearances that take place under the frankfurt book fair 's auspices .
this year , the fair aims to introduce the korean book world to a german audience , which knows little about the country and its culture . " with korea we have a country as a guest about which we in germany know relatively little - much too little .
about 40 korean authors will be here including , as far as we can tell , north korean authors , " said boos .
" our guest country will present itself at the book fair , in the city , and across germany with a broad program ranging from literature to visual arts . " more than a book fair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt book fair : more than just books not just a literary convention , the book fair 's korean guests will use the open area of the frankfurt convention center grounds to showcase other aspects of korean culture , such as korean dance , martial arts , and korean cuisine . jürgen boos is hopeful that the high-profile fair will increase interest in translating korean literature into german .
" the number of korean literary works that get translated into german has remained disappointingly small , " boos said .
" we would be pleased if it were possible to make korea known in germany as a country of literature and to establish one or the other korean writer as a canonical figure , " he said in an interview . boos is also proud of the frankfurt book fair 's status as a growing convention .

20 , a holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to the often lonely mission of hunting nazi war criminals , leaves a rich legacy for the notion of justice and of the responsibility of civilization to not overlook or forget atrocities against humanity .
around the world , leaders paid their respects to a relentless champion for justice , the dignity of the jewish people and the obligation of civilized society to hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable .
paul spiegel , chairman of the jewish central council in germany , called wiesenthal 's death a great loss and israeli president mosche katzav said wiesenthal was the very embodiment of human decency .
" simon wiesenthal was the conscience of the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the wiesenthal center , the international human-rights ngo that was his namesake . " he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
german president horst köhler said wiesenthal 's life work had nothing to do with revenge , but with justice .
real jewish hero the director of the wiesenthal center in jerusalem , ephraim zuroff , described him as a " real jewish hero " and praised those continuing to work to bring war criminals to justice .
rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon weisenthal center , described how " the world was busy with the cold war and jewish leaders were saying it 's time to forgive and forget , but he knew his mission . "
" i think he gave a tremendous gift to younger generations of germans and austrians by focusing on and helping them to focus on personal responsibility and convicting the criminals , understanding what took place and not giving the mark of cain to the german nation , " he added .
rabbi cooper says wiesenthal 's legacy is even broader in terms of preventing future atrocities . " wiesenthal would always say , ' we do n't know as we speak if tomorrow 's mass murderers are n't already born and are n't looking to see how the civilized world deals with the previous crimes . " '
" if we speak today about situations like rwanda and darfur - none of that would have taken place without the courageous and obstinate leadership of simon wiesenthal , " said rabbi cooper . dw-staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish manhunt for nazi continues one of the most sadistic nazi doctors during the third reich who is suspected of hundreds of murders is still on the run in spain .

he was 96 . wiesenthal , who died after a long illness , helped bring more than 1,100 nazi criminals to justice , according to the simon wiesenthal center , which did not give the cause of his death . rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the los angeles-based center , described wiesenthal as " the conscience of the holocaust . " " when the holocaust ended in 1945 and the whole world went home to forget , he alone remained behind to remember , " hier said in a statement .
" he did not forget .
he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
a survivor born in 1908 in the town of buchach in what is now ukraine , wiesenthal practiced architecture prior to world war ii , when he was twice imprisoned in nazi concentration camps , in 1941-43 and 1944-45 .
wiesenthal was freed by american soldiers from the camp at mauthausen in central austria in may 1945 , but 89 members of his and his wife 's family were killed , among them his mother , stepfather and stepbrother , in the nazi genocide . he founded the jewish documentation center in vienna two years after the end of the war and in 1977 helped set up the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles to fight bigotry and anti-semitism worldwide .

20 , a holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to the often lonely mission of hunting nazi war criminals , leaves a rich legacy for the notion of justice and of the responsibility of civilization to not overlook or forget atrocities against humanity .
around the world , leaders paid their respects to a relentless champion for justice , the dignity of the jewish people and the obligation of civilized society to hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable .
paul spiegel , chairman of the jewish central council in germany , called wiesenthal 's death a great loss and israeli president mosche katzav said wiesenthal was the very embodiment of human decency .
" simon wiesenthal was the conscience of the holocaust , " said rabbi marvin hier , dean and founder of the wiesenthal center , the international human-rights ngo that was his namesake . " he became the permanent representative of the victims , determined to bring the perpetrators of history 's greatest crime to justice . "
german president horst köhler said wiesenthal 's life work had nothing to do with revenge , but with justice .
real jewish hero the director of the wiesenthal center in jerusalem , ephraim zuroff , described him as a " real jewish hero " and praised those continuing to work to bring war criminals to justice .
rabbi abraham cooper , associate dean of the simon weisenthal center , described how " the world was busy with the cold war and jewish leaders were saying it 's time to forgive and forget , but he knew his mission . "
" i think he gave a tremendous gift to younger generations of germans and austrians by focusing on and helping them to focus on personal responsibility and convicting the criminals , understanding what took place and not giving the mark of cain to the german nation , " he added .
rabbi cooper says wiesenthal 's legacy is even broader in terms of preventing future atrocities . " wiesenthal would always say , ' we do n't know as we speak if tomorrow 's mass murderers are n't already born and are n't looking to see how the civilized world deals with the previous crimes . " '
" if we speak today about situations like rwanda and darfur - none of that would have taken place without the courageous and obstinate leadership of simon wiesenthal , " said rabbi cooper . dw-staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish manhunt for nazi continues one of the most sadistic nazi doctors during the third reich who is suspected of hundreds of murders is still on the run in spain .

americans take heart : the united states is apparently not the only major western democracy unable to pull off an election .
germany 's vote on sunday has been a disaster from the get-go , says dw-world 's marc young . i believe berlin 's daily newspaper der tagesspiegel got it right : the best thing you can say about this election is that it was a very short one . it started with a faked confidence vote , was followed up by a constitutional challenge , and ended with two would-be chancellors squabbling over the right to form the next government .
to top off this extremely absurd electoral circus , the death of an insignificant neo-nazi parliamentary candidate will delay the official outcome for two weeks .
the only thing missing was florida-style butterfly ballots . certainly those germans who smugly point towards america 's election fiasco in 2000 as evidence of how broken the united states political system is , should be much quieter at the next cocktail party they attend . but how did germany , that once shining model of stable parliamentary democracy , get it all so wrong ?
this deeply flawed election and its deeply unsatisfying result have exposed dangerous cracks both in german society and its political system . a n ot-so-gra n d coalitio n ? neither the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens nor the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their pro-business allies , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , managed to win a majority . now germany faces either the prospect of a not so grand coalition of the two major parties or some inherently instable three-party grouping such as a " traffic light " with the spd , greens and fdp .
that is , if the party leaders , who continue to spit campaign-trail bile at one another , manage to cobble together a government at all .
if not , we could see the worst of possible scenarios , that is , new elections . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder smiles prior to a tv discussion after the german parliamentary election in germany 's capital berlin on sunday , sept .
18 , 2005 . at the moment , things do not look good .
schröder , apparently giddy over the fact his spd had n't been completely routed at the polls , put on an especially ugly performance at a televised round table discussion of the leaders of all major parties .
despite the fact the spd is almost certain to win fewer seats than the conservatives , he arrogantly refused to admit he 'd lost the election . maybe he was delighting in schade n freude over the poor result for merkel 's cdu .
maybe he was hoping to encourage her conservative rivals to sharpen their knives after their dismal showing .
however , he is doing germany no favors by making the ridiculous claim : " no one aside from me is in the position to form a stable government . " huh ?
did i miss something ? this whole circus started when schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote on the grounds he could not ensure a steady working majority within his own coalition .
now after his social democrats do n't even manage to remain the largest party in parliament , he 's suddenly the guarantor of stability ? merkel fritters away her lead do n't get me wrong .
i do n't think merkel would be any better suited to form a solid government , especially with voices within her own party already starting to blame her - and rightly so - for the conservatives ' horrendously run campaign .
never completely accepted at the top of the cdu , she certainly has n't made any fans by frittering away a double-digit lead in opinion polls in only a matter of months . bildunterschrift : a poster of an airbrushed angela merkel still adorns the cdu headquarters in berlin . "
a new beginning , " it reads when schröder decided last may to bring forward germany 's general election by a year , he had hoped to get a mandate for his unpopular economic reforms .
the logic was that either he would be vindicated by the voters or the conservative opposition would take over the job of overhauling the world 's third largest economy .
but german voters have instead opted for some messy compromise that may simply prolong the country 's woes . to make things worse , schröder 's intentionally lost confidence vote has muddied the workings of the country 's constitutional institutions .
although the constitution does not allow the chancellor to dissolve parliament , he or she can now do so with a faked confidence vote .
therefore it is imperative the german parliament pass an amendment establishing a proper method to dissolve itself in the future . that 's the only sure way to avoid a repeat of the grand political farce we 've had this summer . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany not ready for change the result of the german polls is a big surprise .
contrary to pollsters ' predictions , germans did n't vote for a change in government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 20.09.2005 what next after german political stalemate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both have their sights trained on the chancellory the inconclusive poll has left schröder and merkel jockeying for power .
by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .
according to the constitution , the new parliament must meet by the aforementioned date , 30 days after the election .
the oldest member of parliament opens the first session , during which the chancellor is traditionally named .
spotlight on the german president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler this is also where the german president , horst köhler , steps in . in the first round of voting , köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- must name a chancellor candidate - and not necessarily from the strongest group in parliament .
theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .
to be elected , the candidate in this round must also win 307 votes .
a new round of elections ?
if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .
if he or she does not have 307 votes or more , köhler must make a decision : either he appoints the chancellor at the head of a minority government , also within seven days , or he dissolves parliament and calls new elections - a situation that is without precedent in german postwar history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

by law , either one can become the next chancellor .
but , it 's the president who can eventually weigh in and name a candidate if talks drag on . as germany descends into political confusion following a tight vote that produced no clear winner and has left both chancellor gerhard schröder and angela merkel stake conflicting claims to form the next government , the big question on everyone 's lips is " what next ? "
germans hoping to find an answer in the country 's complex legal system are however likely to be disappointed .
the statutes on german constitutional law contain no provisions for the unfolding political scenario .
instead , it 's political scientists who provide some clues .
" it 's not true that the strongest group in parliament automatically has the right to designate the chancellor , " leipzig-based constitutional law expert christoph degenhart told german public broadcaster ard , adding that this information , however , was neither to be found in the law books , nor is it a democratic custom .
no guiding law indeed , german constitutional law does n't even have a paragraph on " a mandate for government-building . "
wolfram häfling , another political scientist , echoed degenhart 's views .
the arguments put forward by merkel and schröder are n't " legitimized by the constitution , " häfling told ard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's vote gave merkel 's conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , a wafer-thin advantage of three seats in parliament over schröder 's social democrats , but no governing majority .
merkel has used the argument that since the conservative alliance is the biggest group in parliament , she has the right to form the next government .
for his part , schröder has pointed out that the conservative alliance is actually made up of two separate parties and that his spd has fared better than each party individually , and thus staked a claim to build the government .
historical precedent a look at german postwar history confirms that the biggest group in parliament has usually provided the chancellor , but there are exceptions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt for instance , in 1969 , the conservatives did garner more votes , but it was willy brandt -lrb- photo -rrb- of the spd who became chancellor .
in informal talks with walter scheel , head of the free-market liberal fdp , brandt managed to forge a spd-fdp coalition .
that government lasted until 1974 .
the same thing could happen this time , too , if the spd manages to hammer out a so-called " traffic-light " coalition with the fdp and the greens , and schröder - the candidate of the second-biggest group in parliament - stayed on as chancellor .
even as parties open talks between possible coalition partners this week , experts are already warning that given the fact that several different constellations appear possible , the bargaining could drag on for weeks .
no time limit ?
indeed , in theory , there is no time limit on how much time the parties can take to form a ruling coalition .
but they will aim to have completed talks within four weeks and before the first session of parliament , which must take place by october 18 .
on this point the law books are much clearer .
according to the constitution , the new parliament must meet by the aforementioned date , 30 days after the election .

spotlight on the german president bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler this is also where the german president , horst köhler , steps in . in the first round of voting , köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- must name a chancellor candidate - and not necessarily from the strongest group in parliament .
theoretically , he could trust the spd , fdp and the greens to form a stable governmental coalition and could recommend schröder as chancellor even though he 's the candidate of the second-largest group in parliament .
köhler 's nominee for chancellor must secure an absolute majority in the parliament - 307 votes .
köhler can , however , nominate a chancellor only for the first round of voting .
if the first candidate does not get a majority , a second round of voting can take place within two weeks , possibly with another candidate standing for chancellor .
to be elected , the candidate in this round must also win 307 votes .
a new round of elections ?
if the first two rounds of voting do n't provide a chancellor , then a third round of voting takes place immediately after the second and the candidate with the most votes wins .
if he or she has an absolute majority , köhler will automatically name him or her chancellor within seven days .
if he or she does not have 307 votes or more , köhler must make a decision : either he appoints the chancellor at the head of a minority government , also within seven days , or he dissolves parliament and calls new elections - a situation that is without precedent in german postwar history . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish foreign minister dermot ahern , left , and cypriot foreign minister george iacovou attend the first round table meeting during an eu foreign ministers meeting in newport , wales , thursday sept .
1 , 2005 .
the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .
this framework still hangs partially in the balance , due to austria 's statement that it would prefer the aim of negotiations change from full membership for turkey to a form of " privileged partnership " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara in 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister has repeatedly rejected a proposition from german chancellor candidate angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

the deal removes a key hurdle ahead of the start of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 . " the way for accession talks should be cleared in time , " said a spokesman for the british eu-presidency . this so called " counter-declaration " was necessary because turkey issued its own declaration in july stating that it had no immediate intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the internationally recognized greek cypriot government . back then turkey signed a customs accord concerning the eu 's 10 newest member states , which included cyprus .
however , ankara has failed to open its ports to cypriot vessels , despite the accord .
the eu warned turkey in no uncertain terms , that failure to fulfill the obligations stemming from this customs union could stall accession talks indefinitely . britain trying to move the ball forward monday 's counter declaration , due to be formally endorsed by ministers on tuesday , was achieved only after the uk presidency of the eu squared its expectations of what ankara would accept with cyprus 's demands for improved ties . among other things the declaration states that ankara must recognize the cypriot government , but allowed it to do so any time up to the time of actual accession - a process which could take over a decade .
we think this is a balanced text , " a eu spokesman told london 's financial times .
" we are very pleased after a long day to reach agreement on the declaration at an ambassadorial level .
now we hope for approval by ministers . "

the final deal fell short of some of cyprus ' initial demands , but the uk did in fact validate a proposal it had rejected last week which declares that prior recognition of the eu 's 25 member states is a " necessary component of the accession process " for turkey .
previously london had been afraid that such a formulation could be viewed as an attempt to link recognition of cyprus with the negotiations themselves rather than with turkey 's final membership . there was no immediate response from turkey , which has occupied the northern part of cyprus fore more than 30 years .
a un-sponsored plan for re-unification of the mediterranean island was rejected by the greek cypriots in april 2004 , just days before cyprus became full member of the bloc . accession talks set for early october the last piece of turkeys ' accession talks puzzle stems from a so-called " framework for negotiations " .

this idea has no support among the other 24 eu-nations , " therefore it should be possible to get an agreed framework before october 3rd , when accession talks are due to start in luxembourg , " said a spokesman of the british eu presidency . the concept of privileged partnership is only supported by angela merkel , the head of germany 's conservative christian democrat party , who hopes to take over as chancellor . however , opposition by a merkel-led bundestag -lrb- if it even happens -rrb- would very likely take several months to formalize . meanwhile , turkey and the eu are set to start historic accession talks in early october , 40 years after ankara had submitted its application . bernt riegert -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month .

sueddeutsche zeitung says the election result has made it impossible for any party to form a stable government .
" germany has voted for the perfect stalemate , the greatest possible self-obstruction , total paralysis , " the paper says .
it believes that chancellor gerhard schroeder intends to remain chancellor until his social democrats and the opposition christian democrats agree on a coalition headed by " two new figures " , as the only alternative would be fresh elections .
the paper suggests that the chancellor is prepared to accept either outcome with " one goal " in mind : that of preventing the leader of the christian democratic union , angela merkel , from becoming chancellor .
der tagesspiegel also believes that mr schroeder would only be prepared to give up his claim to the chancellorship if mrs merkel were to do likewise .
" merkel must make way , then he could go , too , " the paper says , and " then it would also be easier for the parties to come to an agreement . "
but it warns that for the time being the chancellor " does not want a grand coalition but a great clash " .
die tageszeitung agrees that the only solution would be for mr schroeder and mrs merkel to make way for others .
" then schroeder would at least have stopped merkel , and would thus have achieved a final triumph , " the paper says .
berliner zeitung wonders whether the chancellor is aiming for fresh elections in the hope that they will provide him and his current coalition partner , the greens , with a parliamentary majority .
but the paper warns that this would be a case of the government letting people vote " until it is happy with the result " .
' jamaica solution ' frankfurter allgemeine zeitung makes the case for a coalition between the centre-right christian union parties , the pro-business free democrats and the greens .
the paper acknowledges that none of these parties have made any preparations for what is widely dubbed the " jamaica coalition " option , after the parties ' colours - black , yellow and green .
but it suggests that it could be preferable to a grand coalition .
" despite predictable fierce conflicts over energy policy or health insurance , a coalition of the union parties , the fdp and the greens could turn out to be more eager for reforms than a grand coalition of small steps . "
but frankfurter rundschau favours a grand coalition over the " jamaica " scenario .
the paper 's main objection to a government including the christian union parties , the free democrats and the greens is that voters did not anticipate such an option .
it argues that a grand coalition would provide a way out , " however unpleasant " it may be .
" it could work through a specific programme - on reforming federalism , the budget and taxes , cutting subsidies , care - which , in any case , requires a consensus between the camps , " the paper says .
vote against reform several papers interpret the election result as a vote against any radical social or economic reforms .
" the forces of reform have been punished at the ballot box , " says die welt .
the paper believes , however , that deregulation is necessary to boost the economy .
" the question of who will eventually take over this mission is less important than that of the right policies . "
the paper is open to the idea of mr schroeder remaining chancellor provided he becomes a reformer again " against his party " .
" perhaps in the end germany ... will have to be reformed from the left after all , " it says .
die tageszeitung interprets the election result as a vote against " the anglo-saxon model " .
" neoliberal ideas have been voted out by a clear majority , " the paper says .
" so much for the issue of reforms , " says frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
the paper argues that both mrs merkel and mr schroeder identified themselves with reforms , and that they have been punished for it .
" life is not so bad here , after all , that most people would expect their circumstances to improve as a result of a fundamental reorganization of things , " it says .

health minister shaun woodward said he would decide in the autumn whether to introduce a full or partial ban .

the federation of retail licensed trade said it recognised the " health risks associated with smoking , " but maintained there were " ways to lessen the risk without affecting trade or resulting in job losses " .
issues expected to be raised at the debate on tuesday will include the health risks of " second-hand " smoke and how legislation might impact on health inequalities and the workforce .
