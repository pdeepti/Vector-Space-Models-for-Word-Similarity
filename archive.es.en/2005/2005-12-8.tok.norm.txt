" we heard only general explanations ..
i do n't think yesterday brought us a single step forward , " heinz lanfermann , a member of the liberal free democrats parliamentary faction told news channel n-tv , according to reuters . pressure mounting as german anger over reports that their country was used as a transit point for so-called renditions , the covert transportation of terror suspects to third countries , continues to rise , opposition politicians are upping the pressure on the merkel government , as well as her predecessors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister otto schily said he was willing to testify german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted tuesday that he was informed last year of el-masri 's case , who was seized by the cia and flown to a secret prison in afghanistan in 2003 .
steinmeier was at the time chief of state to then-chancellor schröder . former interior minister otto schily was also forced to admit that he had been informed of the kidnapping in 2004 by former us ambassador dan coates .
free democratic party chief guido westerwelle called for an extensive investigation into the affair , and how many more government officials might have known . open , not closed door investigation he told the sueddeutsche zeitung that prosecutors should look into the behavior of schily and former foreign minister joschka fischer - reportedly also informed - saying tacit knowledge of the kidnapping could be constituted as a crime .
westerwelle was one of several opposition politicians to call for a special parliamentary investigative committee to look into the case .
government politicians have rejected such a wide-reaching , public forum for investigating the case .
they prefer the case be heard in the bundestag 's controlling committee , which meets behind closed doors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a public investigation schily said in thursday 's edition of the weekly paper , die zeit , that he would be willing to testify before such a committee .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.12.2005 criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is looking at the eu budget crisis through tinted glasses , say critics eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .
can they ?
it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .
they 're proposing eight , that 's unacceptable , " he said . straw replied , he would be willing to take that step , if france agreed to slash farm subsidies .
but france even refuses to review the agricultural budget in 2008 , said mr straw . need for new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw will offer new ideas eu leaders failed in june to agree on funding , split over britain 's refusal to give ground on its rebate and french resistance to reform of generous farm subsidies , of which paris is the main recipient . spanish europe minister alberto navarro also stressed that concessions on britain 's rebate were key to any agreement . " we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .
but overall the discussions could lead to a successful end . " he welcomed the british proposal to freeze the volume of the overall budget .
that would mean less payments for germany and other net payers . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european foreign ministers to meet over eu budget ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .

can they ?
it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .
they 're proposing eight , that 's unacceptable , " he said . straw replied , he would be willing to take that step , if france agreed to slash farm subsidies .
but france even refuses to review the agricultural budget in 2008 , said mr straw . need for new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw will offer new ideas eu leaders failed in june to agree on funding , split over britain 's refusal to give ground on its rebate and french resistance to reform of generous farm subsidies , of which paris is the main recipient . spanish europe minister alberto navarro also stressed that concessions on britain 's rebate were key to any agreement . " we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .
but overall the discussions could lead to a successful end . " he welcomed the british proposal to freeze the volume of the overall budget .

schalke , however , were eliminated , ending hopes of a german triumvirate . even after a 5-1 massacre of greece 's panathinaikos , it was n't until barcelona 's 2-0 victory over italy 's udinese was projected on the big screen that the 38,000 fans in bremen 's weser stadium were really able to celebrate .
tied on points with udinese , the german club advanced thanks to a win in the series against the italian club . bremen ' overjoyed ' at moving on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's 2-0 win over udinese was just as important as bremen 's 5-1 result " we 're overjoyed .
we had to do our job and hoped barcelona would win , " said bremen stirker and german international miroslav klose , making an unexpected appearance in a face mask after breaking his cheekbone two weeks ago . panathinaikos were shell-shocked after a second minute penalty put bremen up 1-0 and worse was to come as paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez struck twice in three minutes to wrap up the game early on . klose made it 4-0 in the 51st minute with a clinical finish , and torsten frings finished the scoring late on after panathinaikos had netted a consolation goal . " we did n't make any mistakes and were in a position to keep the pressure on panathinaikos for the whole game , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we proved that we can achieve good results against the biggest names . " bayern unhappy with second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's martin demichelis , left , will face tougher opponents than bruge 's gaetan englebert , in the next round there was little at stake for either of the teams in the match between bayern munich and belgian champions bruges and it showed in the uninspiring 1-1 draw . munich had already booked a spot in the round of 16 with a lock on either first or second in their group behind , and bruges did n't have a chance at advancing behind munich and juventus , but knew their spot in the uefa cup was secure . bayern coach felix magath could n't hide his disappointment with the tie that put bayern into second place in group a and could pit them against a stronger opponent than juventus , who won the group . " it is not what we wanted going into the game , but we know that we 'll have to live with the disadvantages of being in second place , " he said .
" that 's football and we 'll have to see who we get in the lottery . " milan tops schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's christian poulsen , left , could n't repeat the bundesliga win he orchestrated over bielefeld ac milan 's brazilian midfielder kaka scored twice as the italians edged out schalke 3-2 at the san siro to clinch a place in the last 16 .
milan went through as winners of group e , but a defeat or a 3-3 draw would have ended them crying in their cappuccinos . two fierce strikes from kaka put milan up 3-1 following a first half goal from milan 's andrea pirlo and short-lived equalizer from christian poulsen .
but schalke 's lincoln breathed life back into the team and gave milan a nervy last 24 minutes to endure when his deflected shot crept in . using the same lineup that won saturday 's bundesliga match against arminia bielefeld , ralf rangnick 's schalke determined the game 's pace over long stretches , giving up the two kaka goals on milan counter attacks . " at the beginning of the seocnd half we had some strong phases , but i 'm disappointed that we gave up two goals after controlling the ball , " rangnick said .
" these mistakes let a nervous , tattered opponent take the lead .

can they ?
it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .
they 're proposing eight , that 's unacceptable , " he said . straw replied , he would be willing to take that step , if france agreed to slash farm subsidies .
but france even refuses to review the agricultural budget in 2008 , said mr straw . need for new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw will offer new ideas eu leaders failed in june to agree on funding , split over britain 's refusal to give ground on its rebate and french resistance to reform of generous farm subsidies , of which paris is the main recipient . spanish europe minister alberto navarro also stressed that concessions on britain 's rebate were key to any agreement . " we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .
but overall the discussions could lead to a successful end . " he welcomed the british proposal to freeze the volume of the overall budget .

not to gdr victims erich honecker 's shower gel is sure to have you stepping out of the shower smelling like an old communist .
but gdr victims ' groups are incensed at the last " ostalgie " product to hit the shelves . the gel , which hit the store shelves a few days ago and is being advertised by the supermarket chain reichelt is called " east german erich 's shower gel . "
named after the former gdr leader , an advertisement promises that it comes on the recommendation of countless " leading state-owned companies and fellow comrades . " retailing between 2.49 and 6 euros -lrb- $ 2.90 and $ 7 -rrb- , the gel is the latest in a long line of products mocking or playing on nostalgia for the communist german democratic republic .
gdr victims ' groups are not amused . " these items are simply tasteless .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured . " european ministers voiced their concerns that there should not be a different interpretation of international law , " said germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , arriving for a day of nato talks . but wednesday evening 's dinner was " very satisfactory for all of us , " he said , adding that the talks were " open .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured . " european ministers voiced their concerns that there should not be a different interpretation of international law , " said germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , arriving for a day of nato talks . but wednesday evening 's dinner was " very satisfactory for all of us , " he said , adding that the talks were " open . " a clarification , not a shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no public denial over secret prisons from rice rice arrived in brussels after stops in germany , romania and ukraine .
her last stop also risked being her most difficult , specifically because the european union 's british presidency had asked for formal clarification . in an attempt to preempt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue shortly before arriving in brussels wednesday afternoon . specifically rice said that washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .
" our people wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " talks very useful on thursday she made no comment as she arrived for the nato talks . but european ministers who spoke to reporters all gave the impression that the issue had been clarified .
slovak foreign minister eduard kukan said the dinner with rice had been " very useful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and everyone is happy " very satisfied , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot , who had been one of the most concerned before the talks , when asked if he was happy with rice 's explanations . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht told journalists late wednesday , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the dinner . a us official said rice had started a " dialogue " with european counterparts on the cia prison row , adding that there was " no table thumping " at a dinner to clear the air . not risking ' antagonizing ' the us " there was no posturing , fiery denunciations , table thumping , playing to the gallery or anything like that .
it was a serious discussion of the issues , " said the senior us official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" this discussion we 're going to have with europeans is going to go on , but it is now a dialogue .

it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .

" we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point .

can they ?
it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .
they 're proposing eight , that 's unacceptable , " he said . straw replied , he would be willing to take that step , if france agreed to slash farm subsidies .
but france even refuses to review the agricultural budget in 2008 , said mr straw . need for new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw will offer new ideas eu leaders failed in june to agree on funding , split over britain 's refusal to give ground on its rebate and french resistance to reform of generous farm subsidies , of which paris is the main recipient . spanish europe minister alberto navarro also stressed that concessions on britain 's rebate were key to any agreement . " we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .
but overall the discussions could lead to a successful end . " he welcomed the british proposal to freeze the volume of the overall budget .

she has repeatedly attempted to defuse the row with public declarations renouncing torture and abuse . afghanistan tops agenda the main focus of thursday 's talks is expected to be a deal to expand the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into afghanistan 's more volatile south , where the us is keen for nato to ease pressure on its stretched forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldier in afghanistan nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . but officials conceded it will be difficult to avoid having the cia debacle cloud debate . " it 's not on the formal agenda , but i would be surprised if it does n't come up , " one nato official told afp news service before rice arrived wednesday . plagued by controversy rice arrived in brussels , home to both nato and the european union 's main institutions , from a stopover in kiev .
she had previously travelled to germany and then romania . the cia controversy has plagued the trip from the start .
rice made a statement before heading from washington underlining us rejection of torture , but keeping silent on alleged secret cia prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with rice -lrb- left -rrb- at a press conference in berlin tuesday on a visit to berlin tuesday , rice acknowledged that washington made a mistake in detaining a german citizen and flying him to afghanistan for questioning , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters after the talks . the issue seems likely to resurface in brussels , notably since british foreign secretary jack straw - whose country currently holds the eu presidency - has written to rice seeking clarification . ' we operate under us law ' in an apparent attempt to pre-empt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue in kiev . specifically , rice said washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " rice said .
" our people , wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " ' satisfactory ' explanation an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " at a meeting late wednesday , rice provided explanations about the cia flights to her european counterparts , who said they were " satisfied , " according to belgian foreign minister karel de gucht . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , de gucht told journalists , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the meeting of nato and eu foreign ministers . focus on middle east thursday 's talks at sprawling nato headquarters on the outskirts of brussels will start with a breakfast focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . the nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy follows rice to brussels and nato us secretary of state condoleezza rice will meet with her nato and eu counterparts in brussels on wednesday and thursday for talks under the shadow of alleged secret cia prison flights to europe .

she has repeatedly attempted to defuse the row with public declarations renouncing torture and abuse . afghanistan tops agenda the main focus of thursday 's talks is expected to be a deal to expand the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into afghanistan 's more volatile south , where the us is keen for nato to ease pressure on its stretched forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldier in afghanistan nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . but officials conceded it will be difficult to avoid having the cia debacle cloud debate . " it 's not on the formal agenda , but i would be surprised if it does n't come up , " one nato official told afp news service before rice arrived wednesday . plagued by controversy rice arrived in brussels , home to both nato and the european union 's main institutions , from a stopover in kiev .
she had previously travelled to germany and then romania . the cia controversy has plagued the trip from the start .
rice made a statement before heading from washington underlining us rejection of torture , but keeping silent on alleged secret cia prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with rice -lrb- left -rrb- at a press conference in berlin tuesday on a visit to berlin tuesday , rice acknowledged that washington made a mistake in detaining a german citizen and flying him to afghanistan for questioning , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters after the talks . the issue seems likely to resurface in brussels , notably since british foreign secretary jack straw - whose country currently holds the eu presidency - has written to rice seeking clarification . ' we operate under us law ' in an apparent attempt to pre-empt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue in kiev . specifically , rice said washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " rice said .
" our people , wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " ' satisfactory ' explanation an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " at a meeting late wednesday , rice provided explanations about the cia flights to her european counterparts , who said they were " satisfied , " according to belgian foreign minister karel de gucht . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , de gucht told journalists , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the meeting of nato and eu foreign ministers . focus on middle east thursday 's talks at sprawling nato headquarters on the outskirts of brussels will start with a breakfast focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . the nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy follows rice to brussels and nato us secretary of state condoleezza rice will meet with her nato and eu counterparts in brussels on wednesday and thursday for talks under the shadow of alleged secret cia prison flights to europe .

" we heard only general explanations ..

" we heard only general explanations ..

steinmeier was at the time chief of state to then-chancellor schröder . former interior minister otto schily was also forced to admit that he had been informed of the kidnapping in 2004 by former us ambassador dan coates .
free democratic party chief guido westerwelle called for an extensive investigation into the affair , and how many more government officials might have known . open , not closed door investigation he told the sueddeutsche zeitung that prosecutors should look into the behavior of schily and former foreign minister joschka fischer - reportedly also informed - saying tacit knowledge of the kidnapping could be constituted as a crime .
westerwelle was one of several opposition politicians to call for a special parliamentary investigative committee to look into the case .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured . " european ministers voiced their concerns that there should not be a different interpretation of international law , " said germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , arriving for a day of nato talks . but wednesday evening 's dinner was " very satisfactory for all of us , " he said , adding that the talks were " open . " a clarification , not a shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no public denial over secret prisons from rice rice arrived in brussels after stops in germany , romania and ukraine .
her last stop also risked being her most difficult , specifically because the european union 's british presidency had asked for formal clarification . in an attempt to preempt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue shortly before arriving in brussels wednesday afternoon . specifically rice said that washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .
" our people wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " talks very useful on thursday she made no comment as she arrived for the nato talks . but european ministers who spoke to reporters all gave the impression that the issue had been clarified .
slovak foreign minister eduard kukan said the dinner with rice had been " very useful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and everyone is happy " very satisfied , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot , who had been one of the most concerned before the talks , when asked if he was happy with rice 's explanations . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht told journalists late wednesday , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the dinner . a us official said rice had started a " dialogue " with european counterparts on the cia prison row , adding that there was " no table thumping " at a dinner to clear the air . not risking ' antagonizing ' the us " there was no posturing , fiery denunciations , table thumping , playing to the gallery or anything like that .
it was a serious discussion of the issues , " said the senior us official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" this discussion we 're going to have with europeans is going to go on , but it is now a dialogue . " but some critics say that european officials are soft-pedaling the issue to try to avoid a new breach with the u.s. and also to hide their own roles in the issue . a german official involved in foreign policy told dw-world last week that " ittook almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " adding that " people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured .

" " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .

slovak foreign minister eduard kukan said the dinner with rice had been " very useful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and everyone is happy " very satisfied , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot , who had been one of the most concerned before the talks , when asked if he was happy with rice 's explanations . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht told journalists late wednesday , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the dinner . a us official said rice had started a " dialogue " with european counterparts on the cia prison row , adding that there was " no table thumping " at a dinner to clear the air . not risking ' antagonizing ' the us " there was no posturing , fiery denunciations , table thumping , playing to the gallery or anything like that .
it was a serious discussion of the issues , " said the senior us official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" this discussion we 're going to have with europeans is going to go on , but it is now a dialogue . " but some critics say that european officials are soft-pedaling the issue to try to avoid a new breach with the u.s. and also to hide their own roles in the issue . a german official involved in foreign policy told dw-world last week that " ittook almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " adding that " people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .

" i think the study shows we are on the right path , " germany 's ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , said . ' need for awareness ' in recent years america 's image of germany was definitely harmed by germany 's response to the iraq war , ischinger said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.12.2005 iraq stops sending police for german training großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis wo n't be getting any more training from germany 's police iraqi interior minister bayan baqer sulagh has criticized the training of iraqi police recruits by german experts in the united arab emirates and said they would no longer participate in the program . in an announcement whose timing may be more than mere coincidental , sulagh said he expressed his dissatisfaction to germany 's ambassador to the uae and added that they were seeking " training programs which were more serious and more effective . "
" we are n't convinced by the level of training of the iraqi police officers by the german experts , nor by their barely seriously manner , " the minister said tuesday during a press conference in abu dhabi , according to the uae news agency wam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff was kidnapped with her driver on oct .
25 even as sulagh said bagdad would not be sending any more iraqis to the next german-run police training program in march , berlin is desperately trying to secure the release of the hostage susanne osthoff . ceasing training could meet kidnappers ' demands osthoff , the first german national to be kidnapped in iraq , was taken captive last month and a condition for her release was that germany should stop training iraqi police officers , according to press reports . berlin has not confirmed these reports and said it has no information on osthoff 's whereabouts . but - so the speculation goes - if iraq were to pull out of the german training scheme , the kidnappers ' demands would be met without germany being seen as capitulating in the face of a terrorist threat . anti-war stance no protection for germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kidnappers demanded germany stop training police some in germany were surprised at osthoff 's kidnapping , assuming that german nationals would be more or less immune to the threat in iraq because of germany 's opposition to the to the us-led war . berlin refused to send troops to iraq , even as part of nato forces .
it did , however , agree to train iraqi security forces , police and soldiers outside the iraqi territory . after their training , the recruits were to work as bodyguards for members of the iraqi government .
german instructors gave them basic police training and put them through their paces in simulated kidnappings and attacks on government limousines . " the work of the bodyguard does not so much involve fighting an assailant , but rather keeping him at bay and then retreating and evacuating the person you 're protecting to safety , " said jörg kerchek , one of the german instructors . program difficulties apparent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all the iraqi police recruits were suited to the job in february , then german interior minister otto schily visited the al ain military camp in the united arab emirates to see for himself how german police officers were training a first batch of 30 iraqis . schily was surprised see a number of recruits at the course who would evidently derive little benefit from training in hand-to-hand combat because they were physically unsuited to it . " there are weaknesses in this program , " schily said .
" but we know that iraqi policemen lead dangerous lives and we can only admire them for taking on such a job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.12.2005 criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is looking at the eu budget crisis through tinted glasses , say critics eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .
can they ?
it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .
they 're proposing eight , that 's unacceptable , " he said . straw replied , he would be willing to take that step , if france agreed to slash farm subsidies .
but france even refuses to review the agricultural budget in 2008 , said mr straw . need for new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw will offer new ideas eu leaders failed in june to agree on funding , split over britain 's refusal to give ground on its rebate and french resistance to reform of generous farm subsidies , of which paris is the main recipient . spanish europe minister alberto navarro also stressed that concessions on britain 's rebate were key to any agreement . " we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .
but overall the discussions could lead to a successful end . " he welcomed the british proposal to freeze the volume of the overall budget .
that would mean less payments for germany and other net payers . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european foreign ministers to meet over eu budget ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .

" we heard only general explanations ..

steinmeier was at the time chief of state to then-chancellor schröder . former interior minister otto schily was also forced to admit that he had been informed of the kidnapping in 2004 by former us ambassador dan coates .
free democratic party chief guido westerwelle called for an extensive investigation into the affair , and how many more government officials might have known . open , not closed door investigation he told the sueddeutsche zeitung that prosecutors should look into the behavior of schily and former foreign minister joschka fischer - reportedly also informed - saying tacit knowledge of the kidnapping could be constituted as a crime .
westerwelle was one of several opposition politicians to call for a special parliamentary investigative committee to look into the case .
government politicians have rejected such a wide-reaching , public forum for investigating the case .
they prefer the case be heard in the bundestag 's controlling committee , which meets behind closed doors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle wants a public investigation schily said in thursday 's edition of the weekly paper , die zeit , that he would be willing to testify before such a committee .

it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .

" we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .

can they ?
it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .
they 're proposing eight , that 's unacceptable , " he said . straw replied , he would be willing to take that step , if france agreed to slash farm subsidies .
but france even refuses to review the agricultural budget in 2008 , said mr straw . need for new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw will offer new ideas eu leaders failed in june to agree on funding , split over britain 's refusal to give ground on its rebate and french resistance to reform of generous farm subsidies , of which paris is the main recipient . spanish europe minister alberto navarro also stressed that concessions on britain 's rebate were key to any agreement . " we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .
but overall the discussions could lead to a successful end . " he welcomed the british proposal to freeze the volume of the overall budget .

these days , germany 's sixth richest individual is enjoying the fruits of his labors collecting art and riding his harley . the name würth may not carry the cachet of porsche , but the würth group , which markets and distributes everything from screws and fasteners to power tools and drinking water pipes , is one of germany 's biggest postwar success stories . the private company , based in the state of baden-württemberg , recorded sales of 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 and employs almost 47,000 people in 81 counties . much of that success can be traced back to reinhold würth , who , while not the founder of the company , is the man who turned it from a small provincial wholesaler to a manufacturing empire with more than 340 businesses in its portfolio . screws and economic miracles it all started with a few nuts and bolts .
the year was 1945 and much of germany lay in ruins .
that was when reinhold würth 's father , adolf , founded his wholesale screw business .
young reinhold began there as an apprentice .
when adolf died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1954 , his son , then 19 years old , took over the company reins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a würth employee packs goods for shipment from early on , würth showed an acute business sense and set almost immediately on a path of expansion , making double-digit annual growth one of his goals , which he generally attained . the timing was good .
many german cities and towns needed to be rebuilt after the war , and screws were in high demand .
würth kept the focus on a wide range of smaller workshops and craftsmen , and never became dependent on a few large industrial clients , who could have put downward pressure on his prices . würth pioneered new management techniques long before they became fashionable .
he decentralized decision making and let individual divisions and employees have a say in how their sections were run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhold würth he is credited with creating an " esprit de corps " at the company that motivated employees and boosted the bottom line .
he even arranged trips to switzerland and the caribbean for top-performing employees .
the largest of these " family outings " included 1,600 co-workers and their family members , who were treated to a trip to france . motorcycles and modern art in 1994 , würth retired from operative management of the company and took over the chair of the advisory board .
but he hardly withdrew to a rocking chair on the porch , instead choosing to pursue his passions : art and motorcycles . his enthusiasm for art began in the 1960s when he bought a watercolour by emile nolde .
today , he has a collection of 8,000 pieces of modern and contemporary art , including works by picasso , max beckmann , munch , and christo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall in 1991 , würth , now one of germany 's most important art collectors , opened a museum in the town of künzelsau-gaisbach , where the company 's headquarters is located .
in may 2001 , the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall was opened , providing another exhibition forum for his extensive collection . when he 's not buying art , the 70-year-old würth likes to put on his biking gear and go cruising on his beloved harley-davidson .
he also enjoys taking to the skies in one of his two private planes . until the end of 2003 , he had a professorship at the university of karlsruhe and taught students the basics of entrepreneurialism .

it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate .

" we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured . " european ministers voiced their concerns that there should not be a different interpretation of international law , " said germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , arriving for a day of nato talks . but wednesday evening 's dinner was " very satisfactory for all of us , " he said , adding that the talks were " open . " a clarification , not a shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no public denial over secret prisons from rice rice arrived in brussels after stops in germany , romania and ukraine .
her last stop also risked being her most difficult , specifically because the european union 's british presidency had asked for formal clarification . in an attempt to preempt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue shortly before arriving in brussels wednesday afternoon . specifically rice said that washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .
" our people wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " talks very useful on thursday she made no comment as she arrived for the nato talks . but european ministers who spoke to reporters all gave the impression that the issue had been clarified .
slovak foreign minister eduard kukan said the dinner with rice had been " very useful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and everyone is happy " very satisfied , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot , who had been one of the most concerned before the talks , when asked if he was happy with rice 's explanations . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht told journalists late wednesday , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the dinner . a us official said rice had started a " dialogue " with european counterparts on the cia prison row , adding that there was " no table thumping " at a dinner to clear the air . not risking ' antagonizing ' the us " there was no posturing , fiery denunciations , table thumping , playing to the gallery or anything like that .
it was a serious discussion of the issues , " said the senior us official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" this discussion we 're going to have with europeans is going to go on , but it is now a dialogue . " but some critics say that european officials are soft-pedaling the issue to try to avoid a new breach with the u.s. and also to hide their own roles in the issue . a german official involved in foreign policy told dw-world last week that " ittook almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " adding that " people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to .

it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate .

" we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .

"
" we are n't convinced by the level of training of the iraqi police officers by the german experts , nor by their barely seriously manner , " the minister said tuesday during a press conference in abu dhabi , according to the uae news agency wam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff was kidnapped with her driver on oct .
25 even as sulagh said bagdad would not be sending any more iraqis to the next german-run police training program in march , berlin is desperately trying to secure the release of the hostage susanne osthoff . ceasing training could meet kidnappers ' demands osthoff , the first german national to be kidnapped in iraq , was taken captive last month and a condition for her release was that germany should stop training iraqi police officers , according to press reports . berlin has not confirmed these reports and said it has no information on osthoff 's whereabouts . but - so the speculation goes - if iraq were to pull out of the german training scheme , the kidnappers ' demands would be met without germany being seen as capitulating in the face of a terrorist threat . anti-war stance no protection for germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kidnappers demanded germany stop training police some in germany were surprised at osthoff 's kidnapping , assuming that german nationals would be more or less immune to the threat in iraq because of germany 's opposition to the to the us-led war . berlin refused to send troops to iraq , even as part of nato forces .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured . " european ministers voiced their concerns that there should not be a different interpretation of international law , " said germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , arriving for a day of nato talks . but wednesday evening 's dinner was " very satisfactory for all of us , " he said , adding that the talks were " open . " a clarification , not a shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no public denial over secret prisons from rice rice arrived in brussels after stops in germany , romania and ukraine .
her last stop also risked being her most difficult , specifically because the european union 's british presidency had asked for formal clarification . in an attempt to preempt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue shortly before arriving in brussels wednesday afternoon . specifically rice said that washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .
" our people wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " talks very useful on thursday she made no comment as she arrived for the nato talks . but european ministers who spoke to reporters all gave the impression that the issue had been clarified .
slovak foreign minister eduard kukan said the dinner with rice had been " very useful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and everyone is happy " very satisfied , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot , who had been one of the most concerned before the talks , when asked if he was happy with rice 's explanations . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht told journalists late wednesday , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the dinner . a us official said rice had started a " dialogue " with european counterparts on the cia prison row , adding that there was " no table thumping " at a dinner to clear the air . not risking ' antagonizing ' the us " there was no posturing , fiery denunciations , table thumping , playing to the gallery or anything like that .
it was a serious discussion of the issues , " said the senior us official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" this discussion we 're going to have with europeans is going to go on , but it is now a dialogue . " but some critics say that european officials are soft-pedaling the issue to try to avoid a new breach with the u.s. and also to hide their own roles in the issue . a german official involved in foreign policy told dw-world last week that " ittook almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " adding that " people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .

meanwhile , german health inspectors continue to uncover meat past its expiration date but relabeled to appear edible as they tour warehouses - sometimes gagging from the smell of spoiled meat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants more controls , inspectors as a result of such discoveries and the ensuing public outcry , german agriculture minister horst seehofer said that germany is taking measures to tighten controls . " even if we can say right now that there is no sign of mafia-like networks or systems or acute health dangers , these schemes are a threat to health , " seehofer told reporters .
" we must do everything to ensure these black sheep have no chance . " seehofer said that the measures include improved information sharing between agencies , increased inspections , higher fines and harsher penalties for offenders , a ban on the sale of food products below cost price and publicizing the offenders . consumers too price conscious so far , officials have been investigating certain meat traders who store large quantities of meat .
in one case , officials said they seized 60 tons of meat from one company called domenz , based in the western city of gelsenkirchen .
in another , investigators found hundreds of tons of waste from slaughterhouses - usually used in dog food - marked as edible for human .
in bonn , inspectors found tons of meat which had expired two years ago . but german officials have n't left consumers off the hook either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.12.2005 germany seeks to extend climate accords großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to protect the ozone layer , germany wants to get talks rolling now germany 's new environment minister is calling for binding climate-change accords beyond kyoto - with or without us participation . sigmar gabriel became germany 's environment minister just over two weeks ago , but he took the definitive stance of a seasoned leader at the climate change conference in montreal . high up on the conference agenda is the search for a plan to take effect after the kyoto protocol agreement runs out , in 2012 .
so far , ministers - including germany 's gabriel - have been clear in their demands that the world act now in order to get a follow-up agreement in place . setting ' ambitious goals ' gabriel has made it clear that berlin wants more binding targets on emissions reduction - with or without the support of the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel may be new to the job , but he took a stance like a pro the united states is the world 's largest polluter , responsible for a full quarter of greenhouse gas emissions .
yet it and australia are the two nations that have refused to agree to the binding targets under the current kyoto protocol . “ what we need is to begin the second phase of negotiations that must be completed by 2009 , so that when 2012 rolls around we aren ’ t stuck without an agreement ´ , " gabriel said .
" that ’ s what this is about . and it must include ambitious goals like the ones we have now . " watchdog ' pleasantly surprised ' christoph bals , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization germanwatch , said he was happy with gabriel ’ s approach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam and smoke rise from russian cooling towers ; russia signed the accords “ we are pleasantly surprised how the minister has taken up the challenge of the conference .
he made clear that climate is his main issue and his message seems to be quite strong and he has a clear understanding that … binding targets are necessary , and -lrb- that they -rrb- will come , " he said . many observers worry that washington ’ s insistence on a nonbinding agreement is hindering the process .

so far , ministers - including germany 's gabriel - have been clear in their demands that the world act now in order to get a follow-up agreement in place . setting ' ambitious goals ' gabriel has made it clear that berlin wants more binding targets on emissions reduction - with or without the support of the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel may be new to the job , but he took a stance like a pro the united states is the world 's largest polluter , responsible for a full quarter of greenhouse gas emissions .
yet it and australia are the two nations that have refused to agree to the binding targets under the current kyoto protocol . “ what we need is to begin the second phase of negotiations that must be completed by 2009 , so that when 2012 rolls around we aren ’ t stuck without an agreement ´ , " gabriel said .
" that ’ s what this is about . and it must include ambitious goals like the ones we have now . " watchdog ' pleasantly surprised ' christoph bals , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization germanwatch , said he was happy with gabriel ’ s approach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam and smoke rise from russian cooling towers ; russia signed the accords “ we are pleasantly surprised how the minister has taken up the challenge of the conference .
he made clear that climate is his main issue and his message seems to be quite strong and he has a clear understanding that … binding targets are necessary , and -lrb- that they -rrb- will come , " he said . many observers worry that washington ’ s insistence on a nonbinding agreement is hindering the process .

schalke , however , were eliminated , ending hopes of a german triumvirate . even after a 5-1 massacre of greece 's panathinaikos , it was n't until barcelona 's 2-0 victory over italy 's udinese was projected on the big screen that the 38,000 fans in bremen 's weser stadium were really able to celebrate .
tied on points with udinese , the german club advanced thanks to a win in the series against the italian club . bremen ' overjoyed ' at moving on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's 2-0 win over udinese was just as important as bremen 's 5-1 result " we 're overjoyed .
we had to do our job and hoped barcelona would win , " said bremen stirker and german international miroslav klose , making an unexpected appearance in a face mask after breaking his cheekbone two weeks ago . panathinaikos were shell-shocked after a second minute penalty put bremen up 1-0 and worse was to come as paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez struck twice in three minutes to wrap up the game early on . klose made it 4-0 in the 51st minute with a clinical finish , and torsten frings finished the scoring late on after panathinaikos had netted a consolation goal . " we did n't make any mistakes and were in a position to keep the pressure on panathinaikos for the whole game , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we proved that we can achieve good results against the biggest names . " bayern unhappy with second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's martin demichelis , left , will face tougher opponents than bruge 's gaetan englebert , in the next round there was little at stake for either of the teams in the match between bayern munich and belgian champions bruges and it showed in the uninspiring 1-1 draw . munich had already booked a spot in the round of 16 with a lock on either first or second in their group behind , and bruges did n't have a chance at advancing behind munich and juventus , but knew their spot in the uefa cup was secure . bayern coach felix magath could n't hide his disappointment with the tie that put bayern into second place in group a and could pit them against a stronger opponent than juventus , who won the group . " it is not what we wanted going into the game , but we know that we 'll have to live with the disadvantages of being in second place , " he said .
" that 's football and we 'll have to see who we get in the lottery . " milan tops schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's christian poulsen , left , could n't repeat the bundesliga win he orchestrated over bielefeld ac milan 's brazilian midfielder kaka scored twice as the italians edged out schalke 3-2 at the san siro to clinch a place in the last 16 .
milan went through as winners of group e , but a defeat or a 3-3 draw would have ended them crying in their cappuccinos . two fierce strikes from kaka put milan up 3-1 following a first half goal from milan 's andrea pirlo and short-lived equalizer from christian poulsen .
but schalke 's lincoln breathed life back into the team and gave milan a nervy last 24 minutes to endure when his deflected shot crept in . using the same lineup that won saturday 's bundesliga match against arminia bielefeld , ralf rangnick 's schalke determined the game 's pace over long stretches , giving up the two kaka goals on milan counter attacks . " at the beginning of the seocnd half we had some strong phases , but i 'm disappointed that we gave up two goals after controlling the ball , " rangnick said .
" these mistakes let a nervous , tattered opponent take the lead . " the third place finish guarantees schalke 's spot in the uefa cup . man u eliminated by benfica , lille , real betis also out the other teams who qualified for the next round are : arsenal -lrb- eng -rrb- , ajax -lrb- ned -rrb- , barcelona -lrb- esp -rrb- , villarreal -lrb- esp -rrb- , benfica -lrb- por -rrb- , ac milan -lrb- ita -rrb- , psv eindhoven -lrb- ned -rrb- , lyon -lrb- fra -rrb- , real madrid -lrb- esp -rrb- , liverpool -lrb- eng -rrb- , chelsea -lrb- eng -rrb- , inter milan -lrb- ita -rrb- , and the rangers -lrb- sco -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world waiting for world cup draw with the " entire world watching leipzig , " as fifa president sepp blatter puts it , it might be good to get an idea of what exactly you 're watching when the world cup final draw takes place on friday .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured . " european ministers voiced their concerns that there should not be a different interpretation of international law , " said germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , arriving for a day of nato talks . but wednesday evening 's dinner was " very satisfactory for all of us , " he said , adding that the talks were " open .

her last stop also risked being her most difficult , specifically because the european union 's british presidency had asked for formal clarification . in an attempt to preempt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue shortly before arriving in brussels wednesday afternoon . specifically rice said that washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .

" all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht told journalists late wednesday , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the dinner . a us official said rice had started a " dialogue " with european counterparts on the cia prison row , adding that there was " no table thumping " at a dinner to clear the air . not risking ' antagonizing ' the us " there was no posturing , fiery denunciations , table thumping , playing to the gallery or anything like that .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .

a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured .

her last stop also risked being her most difficult , specifically because the european union 's british presidency had asked for formal clarification . in an attempt to preempt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue shortly before arriving in brussels wednesday afternoon . specifically rice said that washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .

so far , ministers - including germany 's gabriel - have been clear in their demands that the world act now in order to get a follow-up agreement in place . setting ' ambitious goals ' gabriel has made it clear that berlin wants more binding targets on emissions reduction - with or without the support of the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel may be new to the job , but he took a stance like a pro the united states is the world 's largest polluter , responsible for a full quarter of greenhouse gas emissions .
yet it and australia are the two nations that have refused to agree to the binding targets under the current kyoto protocol . “ what we need is to begin the second phase of negotiations that must be completed by 2009 , so that when 2012 rolls around we aren ’ t stuck without an agreement ´ , " gabriel said .
" that ’ s what this is about . and it must include ambitious goals like the ones we have now . " watchdog ' pleasantly surprised ' christoph bals , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization germanwatch , said he was happy with gabriel ’ s approach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam and smoke rise from russian cooling towers ; russia signed the accords “ we are pleasantly surprised how the minister has taken up the challenge of the conference .
he made clear that climate is his main issue and his message seems to be quite strong and he has a clear understanding that … binding targets are necessary , and -lrb- that they -rrb- will come , " he said . many observers worry that washington ’ s insistence on a nonbinding agreement is hindering the process .
american delegates have erased all hope of the bush administration taking part in any new international accord . but this position isn ’ t a new one for the us .
president george w. bush has stated many times that america wouldn ’ t tie itself to any multilateral agreement . ' do n't wait for the us ' under the terms of the current kyoto accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 .
the european union promised an 8 percent reduction , although it has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . reinhard loske , an environment expert with germany ’ s green party , said the international community has to move forward without the us . “ my conclusion is , don ’ t wait for the us , don ’ t hide behind the us , but in the medium term we should try to get the us back on board .
and as long as this is not the case , we should try to cooperate with those who are willing in the us . ” the nations signed up to the kyoto protocol have indicated that they are willing to leave the door open for the us for another two years .
if by 2007 washington maintains it ’ s current stance , then the parties to the protocol will move ahead without the world ’ s largest emitter . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe facing environmental disaster through global warming europe is facing the worst climate change in five millennia as a result of global warming , the european environment agency warned in a report issued tuesday as the un 's summit on climate control entered its second day .

so far , ministers - including germany 's gabriel - have been clear in their demands that the world act now in order to get a follow-up agreement in place . setting ' ambitious goals ' gabriel has made it clear that berlin wants more binding targets on emissions reduction - with or without the support of the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel may be new to the job , but he took a stance like a pro the united states is the world 's largest polluter , responsible for a full quarter of greenhouse gas emissions .
yet it and australia are the two nations that have refused to agree to the binding targets under the current kyoto protocol . “ what we need is to begin the second phase of negotiations that must be completed by 2009 , so that when 2012 rolls around we aren ’ t stuck without an agreement ´ , " gabriel said .

president george w. bush has stated many times that america wouldn ’ t tie itself to any multilateral agreement . ' do n't wait for the us ' under the terms of the current kyoto accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 .
the european union promised an 8 percent reduction , although it has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . reinhard loske , an environment expert with germany ’ s green party , said the international community has to move forward without the us . “ my conclusion is , don ’ t wait for the us , don ’ t hide behind the us , but in the medium term we should try to get the us back on board .
and as long as this is not the case , we should try to cooperate with those who are willing in the us . ” the nations signed up to the kyoto protocol have indicated that they are willing to leave the door open for the us for another two years .

but gdr victims ' groups are incensed at the last " ostalgie " product to hit the shelves . the gel , which hit the store shelves a few days ago and is being advertised by the supermarket chain reichelt is called " east german erich 's shower gel . "
named after the former gdr leader , an advertisement promises that it comes on the recommendation of countless " leading state-owned companies and fellow comrades . " retailing between 2.49 and 6 euros -lrb- $ 2.90 and $ 7 -rrb- , the gel is the latest in a long line of products mocking or playing on nostalgia for the communist german democratic republic .
gdr victims ' groups are not amused . " these items are simply tasteless .
they offend the victims of the sed , " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former east german secret police headquarters in berlin , told bild newspaper .
knabe demanded reichelt take the product off of its shelves .
" many of those who were persecuted see the advertisement as mockery of their suffering , he said . " nobody would try something like this with the nazi regime , " he said . a reichelt spokesman told spiegel online that the company had planned to sell the product as a joke .

these days , germany 's sixth richest individual is enjoying the fruits of his labors collecting art and riding his harley . the name würth may not carry the cachet of porsche , but the würth group , which markets and distributes everything from screws and fasteners to power tools and drinking water pipes , is one of germany 's biggest postwar success stories . the private company , based in the state of baden-württemberg , recorded sales of 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 and employs almost 47,000 people in 81 counties . much of that success can be traced back to reinhold würth , who , while not the founder of the company , is the man who turned it from a small provincial wholesaler to a manufacturing empire with more than 340 businesses in its portfolio . screws and economic miracles it all started with a few nuts and bolts .
the year was 1945 and much of germany lay in ruins .
that was when reinhold würth 's father , adolf , founded his wholesale screw business .
young reinhold began there as an apprentice .
when adolf died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1954 , his son , then 19 years old , took over the company reins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a würth employee packs goods for shipment from early on , würth showed an acute business sense and set almost immediately on a path of expansion , making double-digit annual growth one of his goals , which he generally attained . the timing was good .
many german cities and towns needed to be rebuilt after the war , and screws were in high demand .
würth kept the focus on a wide range of smaller workshops and craftsmen , and never became dependent on a few large industrial clients , who could have put downward pressure on his prices . würth pioneered new management techniques long before they became fashionable .
he decentralized decision making and let individual divisions and employees have a say in how their sections were run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhold würth he is credited with creating an " esprit de corps " at the company that motivated employees and boosted the bottom line .
he even arranged trips to switzerland and the caribbean for top-performing employees .
the largest of these " family outings " included 1,600 co-workers and their family members , who were treated to a trip to france . motorcycles and modern art in 1994 , würth retired from operative management of the company and took over the chair of the advisory board .
but he hardly withdrew to a rocking chair on the porch , instead choosing to pursue his passions : art and motorcycles . his enthusiasm for art began in the 1960s when he bought a watercolour by emile nolde .
today , he has a collection of 8,000 pieces of modern and contemporary art , including works by picasso , max beckmann , munch , and christo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall in 1991 , würth , now one of germany 's most important art collectors , opened a museum in the town of künzelsau-gaisbach , where the company 's headquarters is located .
in may 2001 , the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall was opened , providing another exhibition forum for his extensive collection . when he 's not buying art , the 70-year-old würth likes to put on his biking gear and go cruising on his beloved harley-davidson .

can they ?
it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .
they 're proposing eight , that 's unacceptable , " he said . straw replied , he would be willing to take that step , if france agreed to slash farm subsidies .
but france even refuses to review the agricultural budget in 2008 , said mr straw . need for new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw will offer new ideas eu leaders failed in june to agree on funding , split over britain 's refusal to give ground on its rebate and french resistance to reform of generous farm subsidies , of which paris is the main recipient . spanish europe minister alberto navarro also stressed that concessions on britain 's rebate were key to any agreement . " we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .
but overall the discussions could lead to a successful end . " he welcomed the british proposal to freeze the volume of the overall budget .
that would mean less payments for germany and other net payers . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european foreign ministers to meet over eu budget ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .

it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate .

" we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .

" we heard only general explanations ..

schalke , however , were eliminated , ending hopes of a german triumvirate . even after a 5-1 massacre of greece 's panathinaikos , it was n't until barcelona 's 2-0 victory over italy 's udinese was projected on the big screen that the 38,000 fans in bremen 's weser stadium were really able to celebrate .
tied on points with udinese , the german club advanced thanks to a win in the series against the italian club . bremen ' overjoyed ' at moving on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's 2-0 win over udinese was just as important as bremen 's 5-1 result " we 're overjoyed .
we had to do our job and hoped barcelona would win , " said bremen stirker and german international miroslav klose , making an unexpected appearance in a face mask after breaking his cheekbone two weeks ago . panathinaikos were shell-shocked after a second minute penalty put bremen up 1-0 and worse was to come as paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez struck twice in three minutes to wrap up the game early on . klose made it 4-0 in the 51st minute with a clinical finish , and torsten frings finished the scoring late on after panathinaikos had netted a consolation goal . " we did n't make any mistakes and were in a position to keep the pressure on panathinaikos for the whole game , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we proved that we can achieve good results against the biggest names . " bayern unhappy with second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's martin demichelis , left , will face tougher opponents than bruge 's gaetan englebert , in the next round there was little at stake for either of the teams in the match between bayern munich and belgian champions bruges and it showed in the uninspiring 1-1 draw . munich had already booked a spot in the round of 16 with a lock on either first or second in their group behind , and bruges did n't have a chance at advancing behind munich and juventus , but knew their spot in the uefa cup was secure . bayern coach felix magath could n't hide his disappointment with the tie that put bayern into second place in group a and could pit them against a stronger opponent than juventus , who won the group . " it is not what we wanted going into the game , but we know that we 'll have to live with the disadvantages of being in second place , " he said .
" that 's football and we 'll have to see who we get in the lottery .

so far , ministers - including germany 's gabriel - have been clear in their demands that the world act now in order to get a follow-up agreement in place . setting ' ambitious goals ' gabriel has made it clear that berlin wants more binding targets on emissions reduction - with or without the support of the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel may be new to the job , but he took a stance like a pro the united states is the world 's largest polluter , responsible for a full quarter of greenhouse gas emissions .

the european union promised an 8 percent reduction , although it has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . reinhard loske , an environment expert with germany ’ s green party , said the international community has to move forward without the us . “ my conclusion is , don ’ t wait for the us , don ’ t hide behind the us , but in the medium term we should try to get the us back on board .

she has repeatedly attempted to defuse the row with public declarations renouncing torture and abuse . afghanistan tops agenda the main focus of thursday 's talks is expected to be a deal to expand the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into afghanistan 's more volatile south , where the us is keen for nato to ease pressure on its stretched forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldier in afghanistan nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . but officials conceded it will be difficult to avoid having the cia debacle cloud debate . " it 's not on the formal agenda , but i would be surprised if it does n't come up , " one nato official told afp news service before rice arrived wednesday . plagued by controversy rice arrived in brussels , home to both nato and the european union 's main institutions , from a stopover in kiev .
she had previously travelled to germany and then romania . the cia controversy has plagued the trip from the start .
rice made a statement before heading from washington underlining us rejection of torture , but keeping silent on alleged secret cia prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with rice -lrb- left -rrb- at a press conference in berlin tuesday on a visit to berlin tuesday , rice acknowledged that washington made a mistake in detaining a german citizen and flying him to afghanistan for questioning , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters after the talks . the issue seems likely to resurface in brussels , notably since british foreign secretary jack straw - whose country currently holds the eu presidency - has written to rice seeking clarification . ' we operate under us law ' in an apparent attempt to pre-empt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue in kiev . specifically , rice said washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " rice said .
" our people , wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " ' satisfactory ' explanation an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " at a meeting late wednesday , rice provided explanations about the cia flights to her european counterparts , who said they were " satisfied , " according to belgian foreign minister karel de gucht . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , de gucht told journalists , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the meeting of nato and eu foreign ministers . focus on middle east thursday 's talks at sprawling nato headquarters on the outskirts of brussels will start with a breakfast focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . the nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy follows rice to brussels and nato us secretary of state condoleezza rice will meet with her nato and eu counterparts in brussels on wednesday and thursday for talks under the shadow of alleged secret cia prison flights to europe .

these days , germany 's sixth richest individual is enjoying the fruits of his labors collecting art and riding his harley . the name würth may not carry the cachet of porsche , but the würth group , which markets and distributes everything from screws and fasteners to power tools and drinking water pipes , is one of germany 's biggest postwar success stories . the private company , based in the state of baden-württemberg , recorded sales of 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 and employs almost 47,000 people in 81 counties . much of that success can be traced back to reinhold würth , who , while not the founder of the company , is the man who turned it from a small provincial wholesaler to a manufacturing empire with more than 340 businesses in its portfolio . screws and economic miracles it all started with a few nuts and bolts .
the year was 1945 and much of germany lay in ruins .
that was when reinhold würth 's father , adolf , founded his wholesale screw business .
young reinhold began there as an apprentice .
when adolf died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1954 , his son , then 19 years old , took over the company reins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a würth employee packs goods for shipment from early on , würth showed an acute business sense and set almost immediately on a path of expansion , making double-digit annual growth one of his goals , which he generally attained . the timing was good .
many german cities and towns needed to be rebuilt after the war , and screws were in high demand .
würth kept the focus on a wide range of smaller workshops and craftsmen , and never became dependent on a few large industrial clients , who could have put downward pressure on his prices . würth pioneered new management techniques long before they became fashionable .
he decentralized decision making and let individual divisions and employees have a say in how their sections were run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhold würth he is credited with creating an " esprit de corps " at the company that motivated employees and boosted the bottom line .
he even arranged trips to switzerland and the caribbean for top-performing employees .
the largest of these " family outings " included 1,600 co-workers and their family members , who were treated to a trip to france . motorcycles and modern art in 1994 , würth retired from operative management of the company and took over the chair of the advisory board .
but he hardly withdrew to a rocking chair on the porch , instead choosing to pursue his passions : art and motorcycles . his enthusiasm for art began in the 1960s when he bought a watercolour by emile nolde .
today , he has a collection of 8,000 pieces of modern and contemporary art , including works by picasso , max beckmann , munch , and christo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall in 1991 , würth , now one of germany 's most important art collectors , opened a museum in the town of künzelsau-gaisbach , where the company 's headquarters is located .
in may 2001 , the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall was opened , providing another exhibition forum for his extensive collection . when he 's not buying art , the 70-year-old würth likes to put on his biking gear and go cruising on his beloved harley-davidson .
he also enjoys taking to the skies in one of his two private planes . until the end of 2003 , he had a professorship at the university of karlsruhe and taught students the basics of entrepreneurialism .

she has repeatedly attempted to defuse the row with public declarations renouncing torture and abuse . afghanistan tops agenda the main focus of thursday 's talks is expected to be a deal to expand the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into afghanistan 's more volatile south , where the us is keen for nato to ease pressure on its stretched forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldier in afghanistan nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . but officials conceded it will be difficult to avoid having the cia debacle cloud debate . " it 's not on the formal agenda , but i would be surprised if it does n't come up , " one nato official told afp news service before rice arrived wednesday . plagued by controversy rice arrived in brussels , home to both nato and the european union 's main institutions , from a stopover in kiev .
she had previously travelled to germany and then romania . the cia controversy has plagued the trip from the start .
rice made a statement before heading from washington underlining us rejection of torture , but keeping silent on alleged secret cia prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with rice -lrb- left -rrb- at a press conference in berlin tuesday on a visit to berlin tuesday , rice acknowledged that washington made a mistake in detaining a german citizen and flying him to afghanistan for questioning , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters after the talks . the issue seems likely to resurface in brussels , notably since british foreign secretary jack straw - whose country currently holds the eu presidency - has written to rice seeking clarification . ' we operate under us law ' in an apparent attempt to pre-empt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue in kiev . specifically , rice said washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " rice said .
" our people , wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " ' satisfactory ' explanation an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " at a meeting late wednesday , rice provided explanations about the cia flights to her european counterparts , who said they were " satisfied , " according to belgian foreign minister karel de gucht . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , de gucht told journalists , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the meeting of nato and eu foreign ministers . focus on middle east thursday 's talks at sprawling nato headquarters on the outskirts of brussels will start with a breakfast focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . the nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy follows rice to brussels and nato us secretary of state condoleezza rice will meet with her nato and eu counterparts in brussels on wednesday and thursday for talks under the shadow of alleged secret cia prison flights to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.12.2005 criticism prompts britain to promise new proposals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is looking at the eu budget crisis through tinted glasses , say critics eu leaders are trying to break a deadlock over the budget before a summit next week .
can they ?
it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .
they 're proposing eight , that 's unacceptable , " he said . straw replied , he would be willing to take that step , if france agreed to slash farm subsidies .
but france even refuses to review the agricultural budget in 2008 , said mr straw . need for new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw will offer new ideas eu leaders failed in june to agree on funding , split over britain 's refusal to give ground on its rebate and french resistance to reform of generous farm subsidies , of which paris is the main recipient . spanish europe minister alberto navarro also stressed that concessions on britain 's rebate were key to any agreement . " we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .
but overall the discussions could lead to a successful end . " he welcomed the british proposal to freeze the volume of the overall budget .

gdr victims ' groups are not amused . " these items are simply tasteless .
they offend the victims of the sed , " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former east german secret police headquarters in berlin , told bild newspaper .
knabe demanded reichelt take the product off of its shelves .
" many of those who were persecuted see the advertisement as mockery of their suffering , he said . " nobody would try something like this with the nazi regime , " he said . a reichelt spokesman told spiegel online that the company had planned to sell the product as a joke .
according to the spokesman , most have already been sold out , and there are no plans to restock . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " the best of dw-world 's " from the fringe " feature touring east germany without the oppression thirteen years after the collapse of communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- , kitschy nostalgia for a lost culture still lives on in berlin .

these days , germany 's sixth richest individual is enjoying the fruits of his labors collecting art and riding his harley . the name würth may not carry the cachet of porsche , but the würth group , which markets and distributes everything from screws and fasteners to power tools and drinking water pipes , is one of germany 's biggest postwar success stories . the private company , based in the state of baden-württemberg , recorded sales of 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 and employs almost 47,000 people in 81 counties . much of that success can be traced back to reinhold würth , who , while not the founder of the company , is the man who turned it from a small provincial wholesaler to a manufacturing empire with more than 340 businesses in its portfolio . screws and economic miracles it all started with a few nuts and bolts .
the year was 1945 and much of germany lay in ruins .
that was when reinhold würth 's father , adolf , founded his wholesale screw business .
young reinhold began there as an apprentice .
when adolf died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1954 , his son , then 19 years old , took over the company reins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a würth employee packs goods for shipment from early on , würth showed an acute business sense and set almost immediately on a path of expansion , making double-digit annual growth one of his goals , which he generally attained . the timing was good .
many german cities and towns needed to be rebuilt after the war , and screws were in high demand .
würth kept the focus on a wide range of smaller workshops and craftsmen , and never became dependent on a few large industrial clients , who could have put downward pressure on his prices . würth pioneered new management techniques long before they became fashionable .
he decentralized decision making and let individual divisions and employees have a say in how their sections were run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhold würth he is credited with creating an " esprit de corps " at the company that motivated employees and boosted the bottom line .

but he hardly withdrew to a rocking chair on the porch , instead choosing to pursue his passions : art and motorcycles . his enthusiasm for art began in the 1960s when he bought a watercolour by emile nolde .
today , he has a collection of 8,000 pieces of modern and contemporary art , including works by picasso , max beckmann , munch , and christo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall in 1991 , würth , now one of germany 's most important art collectors , opened a museum in the town of künzelsau-gaisbach , where the company 's headquarters is located .
in may 2001 , the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall was opened , providing another exhibition forum for his extensive collection . when he 's not buying art , the 70-year-old würth likes to put on his biking gear and go cruising on his beloved harley-davidson .
he also enjoys taking to the skies in one of his two private planes . until the end of 2003 , he had a professorship at the university of karlsruhe and taught students the basics of entrepreneurialism .

it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .

" we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .

she has repeatedly attempted to defuse the row with public declarations renouncing torture and abuse . afghanistan tops agenda the main focus of thursday 's talks is expected to be a deal to expand the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into afghanistan 's more volatile south , where the us is keen for nato to ease pressure on its stretched forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldier in afghanistan nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . but officials conceded it will be difficult to avoid having the cia debacle cloud debate . " it 's not on the formal agenda , but i would be surprised if it does n't come up , " one nato official told afp news service before rice arrived wednesday . plagued by controversy rice arrived in brussels , home to both nato and the european union 's main institutions , from a stopover in kiev .
she had previously travelled to germany and then romania . the cia controversy has plagued the trip from the start .
rice made a statement before heading from washington underlining us rejection of torture , but keeping silent on alleged secret cia prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- with rice -lrb- left -rrb- at a press conference in berlin tuesday on a visit to berlin tuesday , rice acknowledged that washington made a mistake in detaining a german citizen and flying him to afghanistan for questioning , german chancellor angela merkel told reporters after the talks . the issue seems likely to resurface in brussels , notably since british foreign secretary jack straw - whose country currently holds the eu presidency - has written to rice seeking clarification . ' we operate under us law ' in an apparent attempt to pre-empt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue in kiev . specifically , rice said washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " rice said .
" our people , wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " ' satisfactory ' explanation an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " at a meeting late wednesday , rice provided explanations about the cia flights to her european counterparts , who said they were " satisfied , " according to belgian foreign minister karel de gucht . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , de gucht told journalists , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the meeting of nato and eu foreign ministers . focus on middle east thursday 's talks at sprawling nato headquarters on the outskirts of brussels will start with a breakfast focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . the nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy follows rice to brussels and nato us secretary of state condoleezza rice will meet with her nato and eu counterparts in brussels on wednesday and thursday for talks under the shadow of alleged secret cia prison flights to europe .

"
" we are n't convinced by the level of training of the iraqi police officers by the german experts , nor by their barely seriously manner , " the minister said tuesday during a press conference in abu dhabi , according to the uae news agency wam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff was kidnapped with her driver on oct .

it did , however , agree to train iraqi security forces , police and soldiers outside the iraqi territory . after their training , the recruits were to work as bodyguards for members of the iraqi government .
german instructors gave them basic police training and put them through their paces in simulated kidnappings and attacks on government limousines . " the work of the bodyguard does not so much involve fighting an assailant , but rather keeping him at bay and then retreating and evacuating the person you 're protecting to safety , " said jörg kerchek , one of the german instructors . program difficulties apparent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all the iraqi police recruits were suited to the job in february , then german interior minister otto schily visited the al ain military camp in the united arab emirates to see for himself how german police officers were training a first batch of 30 iraqis . schily was surprised see a number of recruits at the course who would evidently derive little benefit from training in hand-to-hand combat because they were physically unsuited to it . " there are weaknesses in this program , " schily said .
" but we know that iraqi policemen lead dangerous lives and we can only admire them for taking on such a job . " in the meantime schily has left the german government and the complaint about ineffective german training methods will land on the desk of his successor wolfgang schaüble . training in afghanistan to continue the german government decided to prolong the mandate to work with the afghan police until the end of 2006 .
according to schaüble , a stable , reliable police force in afghanistan is an essential factor in fighting terrorist attacks .

"
" we are n't convinced by the level of training of the iraqi police officers by the german experts , nor by their barely seriously manner , " the minister said tuesday during a press conference in abu dhabi , according to the uae news agency wam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff was kidnapped with her driver on oct .
25 even as sulagh said bagdad would not be sending any more iraqis to the next german-run police training program in march , berlin is desperately trying to secure the release of the hostage susanne osthoff . ceasing training could meet kidnappers ' demands osthoff , the first german national to be kidnapped in iraq , was taken captive last month and a condition for her release was that germany should stop training iraqi police officers , according to press reports . berlin has not confirmed these reports and said it has no information on osthoff 's whereabouts . but - so the speculation goes - if iraq were to pull out of the german training scheme , the kidnappers ' demands would be met without germany being seen as capitulating in the face of a terrorist threat . anti-war stance no protection for germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kidnappers demanded germany stop training police some in germany were surprised at osthoff 's kidnapping , assuming that german nationals would be more or less immune to the threat in iraq because of germany 's opposition to the to the us-led war . berlin refused to send troops to iraq , even as part of nato forces .
it did , however , agree to train iraqi security forces , police and soldiers outside the iraqi territory . after their training , the recruits were to work as bodyguards for members of the iraqi government .

these days , germany 's sixth richest individual is enjoying the fruits of his labors collecting art and riding his harley . the name würth may not carry the cachet of porsche , but the würth group , which markets and distributes everything from screws and fasteners to power tools and drinking water pipes , is one of germany 's biggest postwar success stories . the private company , based in the state of baden-württemberg , recorded sales of 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 and employs almost 47,000 people in 81 counties . much of that success can be traced back to reinhold würth , who , while not the founder of the company , is the man who turned it from a small provincial wholesaler to a manufacturing empire with more than 340 businesses in its portfolio . screws and economic miracles it all started with a few nuts and bolts .
the year was 1945 and much of germany lay in ruins .
that was when reinhold würth 's father , adolf , founded his wholesale screw business .
young reinhold began there as an apprentice .
when adolf died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1954 , his son , then 19 years old , took over the company reins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a würth employee packs goods for shipment from early on , würth showed an acute business sense and set almost immediately on a path of expansion , making double-digit annual growth one of his goals , which he generally attained . the timing was good .
many german cities and towns needed to be rebuilt after the war , and screws were in high demand .
würth kept the focus on a wide range of smaller workshops and craftsmen , and never became dependent on a few large industrial clients , who could have put downward pressure on his prices . würth pioneered new management techniques long before they became fashionable .
he decentralized decision making and let individual divisions and employees have a say in how their sections were run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhold würth he is credited with creating an " esprit de corps " at the company that motivated employees and boosted the bottom line .
he even arranged trips to switzerland and the caribbean for top-performing employees .
the largest of these " family outings " included 1,600 co-workers and their family members , who were treated to a trip to france . motorcycles and modern art in 1994 , würth retired from operative management of the company and took over the chair of the advisory board .
but he hardly withdrew to a rocking chair on the porch , instead choosing to pursue his passions : art and motorcycles . his enthusiasm for art began in the 1960s when he bought a watercolour by emile nolde .
today , he has a collection of 8,000 pieces of modern and contemporary art , including works by picasso , max beckmann , munch , and christo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall in 1991 , würth , now one of germany 's most important art collectors , opened a museum in the town of künzelsau-gaisbach , where the company 's headquarters is located .
in may 2001 , the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall was opened , providing another exhibition forum for his extensive collection . when he 's not buying art , the 70-year-old würth likes to put on his biking gear and go cruising on his beloved harley-davidson .
he also enjoys taking to the skies in one of his two private planes . until the end of 2003 , he had a professorship at the university of karlsruhe and taught students the basics of entrepreneurialism .

these days , germany 's sixth richest individual is enjoying the fruits of his labors collecting art and riding his harley . the name würth may not carry the cachet of porsche , but the würth group , which markets and distributes everything from screws and fasteners to power tools and drinking water pipes , is one of germany 's biggest postwar success stories . the private company , based in the state of baden-württemberg , recorded sales of 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- in 2004 and employs almost 47,000 people in 81 counties . much of that success can be traced back to reinhold würth , who , while not the founder of the company , is the man who turned it from a small provincial wholesaler to a manufacturing empire with more than 340 businesses in its portfolio . screws and economic miracles it all started with a few nuts and bolts .
the year was 1945 and much of germany lay in ruins .
that was when reinhold würth 's father , adolf , founded his wholesale screw business .
young reinhold began there as an apprentice .
when adolf died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1954 , his son , then 19 years old , took over the company reins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a würth employee packs goods for shipment from early on , würth showed an acute business sense and set almost immediately on a path of expansion , making double-digit annual growth one of his goals , which he generally attained . the timing was good .
many german cities and towns needed to be rebuilt after the war , and screws were in high demand .
würth kept the focus on a wide range of smaller workshops and craftsmen , and never became dependent on a few large industrial clients , who could have put downward pressure on his prices . würth pioneered new management techniques long before they became fashionable .
he decentralized decision making and let individual divisions and employees have a say in how their sections were run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhold würth he is credited with creating an " esprit de corps " at the company that motivated employees and boosted the bottom line .
he even arranged trips to switzerland and the caribbean for top-performing employees .
the largest of these " family outings " included 1,600 co-workers and their family members , who were treated to a trip to france . motorcycles and modern art in 1994 , würth retired from operative management of the company and took over the chair of the advisory board .
but he hardly withdrew to a rocking chair on the porch , instead choosing to pursue his passions : art and motorcycles . his enthusiasm for art began in the 1960s when he bought a watercolour by emile nolde .
today , he has a collection of 8,000 pieces of modern and contemporary art , including works by picasso , max beckmann , munch , and christo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall in 1991 , würth , now one of germany 's most important art collectors , opened a museum in the town of künzelsau-gaisbach , where the company 's headquarters is located .
in may 2001 , the würth art gallery in schwäbisch hall was opened , providing another exhibition forum for his extensive collection . when he 's not buying art , the 70-year-old würth likes to put on his biking gear and go cruising on his beloved harley-davidson .
he also enjoys taking to the skies in one of his two private planes . until the end of 2003 , he had a professorship at the university of karlsruhe and taught students the basics of entrepreneurialism .

can they ?
it looks increasingly unlikely , observers say . british foreign secretary jack straw agreed this week to make new proposals to try to break the eu 's budget deadlock , after his counterparts poured scorn on offers already on the table . in closed-door " conclave " talks , nearly all of straw 's colleagues gave the thumbs down to proposals made monday , with britain 's budget rebate - described by one minister as a " diabolical instrument " - the key sticking point . britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is racing against the clock to broker a deal on the 2007-13 budget ahead of a summit of eu leaders next thursday and friday in brussels . eu budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , who was reported to have questioned whether britain could be an honest broker , joked afterwards that " an honest broker is supposed to find a solution and unite member states . " " the -lrb- british eu -rrb- presidency today achieved the first step of unity in criticism against them , " she quipped . visibly uneasy , straw responded by saying : " but the criticism was coming from different sides , and that 's what gives me hope " that a deal can be reached . new proposals to break deadlock amid the resounding disapproval , straw said that british prime minister tony blair would hold consultations with other leaders in the coming days to break the deadlock ahead of the summit . " we are going to let colleagues know as quickly as possible in the light of those consultations when next week , and obviously it 'll have to be early next week , we are able to issue further proposals , " he said . on monday , straw presented london 's new proposals to resolve the standoff , seeking to cap overall eu spending at 1.03 percent of the 25-member group 's gross national income . britain would forgo 8 billion euros over seven years of its cherished annual budget rebate , but most of the savings would come from a seven to eight percent cut in planned funds for new member states . britain very isolated the plans to slash aid to the former communist countries in central europe have triggered howls of protest , and not only from the affected countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is isolated , douste-blazy says describing britain as " very isolated , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy called for london to make deep cuts in the multi-billion-euro rebate . " the rebate has to be cut by 14 billion euros so that great britain pays its fair share of enlargement excluding spending on agriculture .
they 're proposing eight , that 's unacceptable , " he said . straw replied , he would be willing to take that step , if france agreed to slash farm subsidies .
but france even refuses to review the agricultural budget in 2008 , said mr straw . need for new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : straw will offer new ideas eu leaders failed in june to agree on funding , split over britain 's refusal to give ground on its rebate and french resistance to reform of generous farm subsidies , of which paris is the main recipient . spanish europe minister alberto navarro also stressed that concessions on britain 's rebate were key to any agreement . " we hope there will be a very clear proposal which goes in another direction which covers ... the problem of the british cheque , " he said . " there will not be an accord if we do n't find a solution to the british cheque , " he added , describing the rebate as " a diabolical instrument " . double standards eu commissioner grybauskaite underlined that the british proposals so far amounted to " double standards ... dividing one policy for 15 member states and one for 12 " - referring to the 10 eu newcomer countries plus romania and bulgaria , due to join in the next couple of years . germany 's new foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , took a softer tone on britain 's budget brokering , acknowledging that foreign ministers considered the current proposals as a starting point . " the british budget draft is a basis we can work on , " he said .
" there are some parts that suit us well , there a some parts that urgently need changes .
but overall the discussions could lead to a successful end . " he welcomed the british proposal to freeze the volume of the overall budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.12.2005 germany seeks to extend climate accords großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to protect the ozone layer , germany wants to get talks rolling now germany 's new environment minister is calling for binding climate-change accords beyond kyoto - with or without us participation . sigmar gabriel became germany 's environment minister just over two weeks ago , but he took the definitive stance of a seasoned leader at the climate change conference in montreal . high up on the conference agenda is the search for a plan to take effect after the kyoto protocol agreement runs out , in 2012 .
so far , ministers - including germany 's gabriel - have been clear in their demands that the world act now in order to get a follow-up agreement in place . setting ' ambitious goals ' gabriel has made it clear that berlin wants more binding targets on emissions reduction - with or without the support of the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel may be new to the job , but he took a stance like a pro the united states is the world 's largest polluter , responsible for a full quarter of greenhouse gas emissions .
yet it and australia are the two nations that have refused to agree to the binding targets under the current kyoto protocol . “ what we need is to begin the second phase of negotiations that must be completed by 2009 , so that when 2012 rolls around we aren ’ t stuck without an agreement ´ , " gabriel said .
" that ’ s what this is about . and it must include ambitious goals like the ones we have now . " watchdog ' pleasantly surprised ' christoph bals , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization germanwatch , said he was happy with gabriel ’ s approach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam and smoke rise from russian cooling towers ; russia signed the accords “ we are pleasantly surprised how the minister has taken up the challenge of the conference .
he made clear that climate is his main issue and his message seems to be quite strong and he has a clear understanding that … binding targets are necessary , and -lrb- that they -rrb- will come , " he said . many observers worry that washington ’ s insistence on a nonbinding agreement is hindering the process .
american delegates have erased all hope of the bush administration taking part in any new international accord . but this position isn ’ t a new one for the us .
president george w. bush has stated many times that america wouldn ’ t tie itself to any multilateral agreement . ' do n't wait for the us ' under the terms of the current kyoto accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 .
the european union promised an 8 percent reduction , although it has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . reinhard loske , an environment expert with germany ’ s green party , said the international community has to move forward without the us . “ my conclusion is , don ’ t wait for the us , don ’ t hide behind the us , but in the medium term we should try to get the us back on board .
and as long as this is not the case , we should try to cooperate with those who are willing in the us . ” the nations signed up to the kyoto protocol have indicated that they are willing to leave the door open for the us for another two years .
if by 2007 washington maintains it ’ s current stance , then the parties to the protocol will move ahead without the world ’ s largest emitter . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe facing environmental disaster through global warming europe is facing the worst climate change in five millennia as a result of global warming , the european environment agency warned in a report issued tuesday as the un 's summit on climate control entered its second day .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured . " european ministers voiced their concerns that there should not be a different interpretation of international law , " said germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , arriving for a day of nato talks . but wednesday evening 's dinner was " very satisfactory for all of us , " he said , adding that the talks were " open . " a clarification , not a shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no public denial over secret prisons from rice rice arrived in brussels after stops in germany , romania and ukraine .
her last stop also risked being her most difficult , specifically because the european union 's british presidency had asked for formal clarification . in an attempt to preempt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue shortly before arriving in brussels wednesday afternoon . specifically rice said that washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .
" our people wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " talks very useful on thursday she made no comment as she arrived for the nato talks . but european ministers who spoke to reporters all gave the impression that the issue had been clarified .
slovak foreign minister eduard kukan said the dinner with rice had been " very useful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and everyone is happy " very satisfied , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot , who had been one of the most concerned before the talks , when asked if he was happy with rice 's explanations . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht told journalists late wednesday , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the dinner . a us official said rice had started a " dialogue " with european counterparts on the cia prison row , adding that there was " no table thumping " at a dinner to clear the air . not risking ' antagonizing ' the us " there was no posturing , fiery denunciations , table thumping , playing to the gallery or anything like that .
it was a serious discussion of the issues , " said the senior us official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" this discussion we 're going to have with europeans is going to go on , but it is now a dialogue . " but some critics say that european officials are soft-pedaling the issue to try to avoid a new breach with the u.s. and also to hide their own roles in the issue . a german official involved in foreign policy told dw-world last week that " ittook almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " adding that " people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .

schalke , however , were eliminated , ending hopes of a german triumvirate . even after a 5-1 massacre of greece 's panathinaikos , it was n't until barcelona 's 2-0 victory over italy 's udinese was projected on the big screen that the 38,000 fans in bremen 's weser stadium were really able to celebrate .
tied on points with udinese , the german club advanced thanks to a win in the series against the italian club . bremen ' overjoyed ' at moving on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's 2-0 win over udinese was just as important as bremen 's 5-1 result " we 're overjoyed .
we had to do our job and hoped barcelona would win , " said bremen stirker and german international miroslav klose , making an unexpected appearance in a face mask after breaking his cheekbone two weeks ago . panathinaikos were shell-shocked after a second minute penalty put bremen up 1-0 and worse was to come as paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez struck twice in three minutes to wrap up the game early on . klose made it 4-0 in the 51st minute with a clinical finish , and torsten frings finished the scoring late on after panathinaikos had netted a consolation goal . " we did n't make any mistakes and were in a position to keep the pressure on panathinaikos for the whole game , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" we proved that we can achieve good results against the biggest names . " bayern unhappy with second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's martin demichelis , left , will face tougher opponents than bruge 's gaetan englebert , in the next round there was little at stake for either of the teams in the match between bayern munich and belgian champions bruges and it showed in the uninspiring 1-1 draw . munich had already booked a spot in the round of 16 with a lock on either first or second in their group behind , and bruges did n't have a chance at advancing behind munich and juventus , but knew their spot in the uefa cup was secure . bayern coach felix magath could n't hide his disappointment with the tie that put bayern into second place in group a and could pit them against a stronger opponent than juventus , who won the group . " it is not what we wanted going into the game , but we know that we 'll have to live with the disadvantages of being in second place , " he said .
" that 's football and we 'll have to see who we get in the lottery . " milan tops schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's christian poulsen , left , could n't repeat the bundesliga win he orchestrated over bielefeld ac milan 's brazilian midfielder kaka scored twice as the italians edged out schalke 3-2 at the san siro to clinch a place in the last 16 .
milan went through as winners of group e , but a defeat or a 3-3 draw would have ended them crying in their cappuccinos . two fierce strikes from kaka put milan up 3-1 following a first half goal from milan 's andrea pirlo and short-lived equalizer from christian poulsen .
but schalke 's lincoln breathed life back into the team and gave milan a nervy last 24 minutes to endure when his deflected shot crept in . using the same lineup that won saturday 's bundesliga match against arminia bielefeld , ralf rangnick 's schalke determined the game 's pace over long stretches , giving up the two kaka goals on milan counter attacks . " at the beginning of the seocnd half we had some strong phases , but i 'm disappointed that we gave up two goals after controlling the ball , " rangnick said .
" these mistakes let a nervous , tattered opponent take the lead .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured . " european ministers voiced their concerns that there should not be a different interpretation of international law , " said germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , arriving for a day of nato talks . but wednesday evening 's dinner was " very satisfactory for all of us , " he said , adding that the talks were " open . " a clarification , not a shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no public denial over secret prisons from rice rice arrived in brussels after stops in germany , romania and ukraine .
her last stop also risked being her most difficult , specifically because the european union 's british presidency had asked for formal clarification . in an attempt to preempt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue shortly before arriving in brussels wednesday afternoon . specifically rice said that washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .
" our people wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " talks very useful on thursday she made no comment as she arrived for the nato talks . but european ministers who spoke to reporters all gave the impression that the issue had been clarified .
slovak foreign minister eduard kukan said the dinner with rice had been " very useful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and everyone is happy " very satisfied , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot , who had been one of the most concerned before the talks , when asked if he was happy with rice 's explanations . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht told journalists late wednesday , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the dinner . a us official said rice had started a " dialogue " with european counterparts on the cia prison row , adding that there was " no table thumping " at a dinner to clear the air . not risking ' antagonizing ' the us " there was no posturing , fiery denunciations , table thumping , playing to the gallery or anything like that .
it was a serious discussion of the issues , " said the senior us official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" this discussion we 're going to have with europeans is going to go on , but it is now a dialogue . " but some critics say that european officials are soft-pedaling the issue to try to avoid a new breach with the u.s. and also to hide their own roles in the issue . a german official involved in foreign policy told dw-world last week that " ittook almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " adding that " people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .

milan went through as winners of group e , but a defeat or a 3-3 draw would have ended them crying in their cappuccinos . two fierce strikes from kaka put milan up 3-1 following a first half goal from milan 's andrea pirlo and short-lived equalizer from christian poulsen .
but schalke 's lincoln breathed life back into the team and gave milan a nervy last 24 minutes to endure when his deflected shot crept in . using the same lineup that won saturday 's bundesliga match against arminia bielefeld , ralf rangnick 's schalke determined the game 's pace over long stretches , giving up the two kaka goals on milan counter attacks . " at the beginning of the seocnd half we had some strong phases , but i 'm disappointed that we gave up two goals after controlling the ball , " rangnick said .

meanwhile , german health inspectors continue to uncover meat past its expiration date but relabeled to appear edible as they tour warehouses - sometimes gagging from the smell of spoiled meat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants more controls , inspectors as a result of such discoveries and the ensuing public outcry , german agriculture minister horst seehofer said that germany is taking measures to tighten controls . " even if we can say right now that there is no sign of mafia-like networks or systems or acute health dangers , these schemes are a threat to health , " seehofer told reporters .
" we must do everything to ensure these black sheep have no chance . " seehofer said that the measures include improved information sharing between agencies , increased inspections , higher fines and harsher penalties for offenders , a ban on the sale of food products below cost price and publicizing the offenders . consumers too price conscious so far , officials have been investigating certain meat traders who store large quantities of meat .
in one case , officials said they seized 60 tons of meat from one company called domenz , based in the western city of gelsenkirchen .
in another , investigators found hundreds of tons of waste from slaughterhouses - usually used in dog food - marked as edible for human .
in bonn , inspectors found tons of meat which had expired two years ago . but german officials have n't left consumers off the hook either .

on thursday , nato agreed to expand the afghanistan mission . us secretary of state condoleezza rice appeared to have cleared the air thursday over the cia secret prisons row , as she held talks at nato on the last day of a european tour clouded by the affair . " it was a good discussion , " said nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , referring to a dinner wednesday night gathering rice with her nato and eu colleagues .
" i think it cleared the air .
secretary rice made a strong intervention . " nato ministers then agreed on thursday to expanding the international security assistance force in afghanistan into the south of the country in 2006 .
at the moment , 9,000 troops , currently under italian command , serve as peackeepers in kabul and the mostly peaceful north and west of the country . around 20,000 american forces are hunting islamic militants in the south and east of afghanistan , that do n't answer to isaf .
at the beginning of 2006 , 6,000 new nato troops will arrive in afghanistan in order to expand the peacekeeping operation . eu ministers satisfied the force expansion was expected , and took back seat to transatlantic tension over cia activities in europe that greeted rice on stops in berlin and brussels during her brief european trip .
a number of european ministers indicated that a closed-door dinner wednesday evening had eased their concerns over the allegations the cia used european airports during the transport of terror suspects to covert prison facilities or countries where they might be tortured . " european ministers voiced their concerns that there should not be a different interpretation of international law , " said germany 's frank-walter steinmeier , arriving for a day of nato talks . but wednesday evening 's dinner was " very satisfactory for all of us , " he said , adding that the talks were " open . " a clarification , not a shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no public denial over secret prisons from rice rice arrived in brussels after stops in germany , romania and ukraine .
her last stop also risked being her most difficult , specifically because the european union 's british presidency had asked for formal clarification . in an attempt to preempt pressure in brussels , rice made a statement on the torture issue shortly before arriving in brussels wednesday afternoon . specifically rice said that washington 's obligations under an international convention prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " extend to us personnel wherever they are , whether they are in the us or outside the us . " " it is also us policy that authorized interrogation will be consistent with us obligations under the convention against torture , which prohibit cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , " she said in kiev .
" our people wherever they are , are operating under us law and us international obligations . " an aide to rice said her remarks marked " a clarification of policy , not a shift of policy . " talks very useful on thursday she made no comment as she arrived for the nato talks . but european ministers who spoke to reporters all gave the impression that the issue had been clarified .
slovak foreign minister eduard kukan said the dinner with rice had been " very useful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and everyone is happy " very satisfied , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot , who had been one of the most concerned before the talks , when asked if he was happy with rice 's explanations . " all said they were satisfied with the explanations that were given " by rice , said belgian foreign minister karel de gucht told journalists late wednesday , though stressing that nothing much new had been said at the dinner . a us official said rice had started a " dialogue " with european counterparts on the cia prison row , adding that there was " no table thumping " at a dinner to clear the air . not risking ' antagonizing ' the us " there was no posturing , fiery denunciations , table thumping , playing to the gallery or anything like that .
it was a serious discussion of the issues , " said the senior us official , speaking on condition of anonymity .
" this discussion we 're going to have with europeans is going to go on , but it is now a dialogue . " but some critics say that european officials are soft-pedaling the issue to try to avoid a new breach with the u.s. and also to hide their own roles in the issue . a german official involved in foreign policy told dw-world last week that " ittook almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " adding that " people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .

meanwhile , german health inspectors continue to uncover meat past its expiration date but relabeled to appear edible as they tour warehouses - sometimes gagging from the smell of spoiled meat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants more controls , inspectors as a result of such discoveries and the ensuing public outcry , german agriculture minister horst seehofer said that germany is taking measures to tighten controls . " even if we can say right now that there is no sign of mafia-like networks or systems or acute health dangers , these schemes are a threat to health , " seehofer told reporters .
" we must do everything to ensure these black sheep have no chance . " seehofer said that the measures include improved information sharing between agencies , increased inspections , higher fines and harsher penalties for offenders , a ban on the sale of food products below cost price and publicizing the offenders . consumers too price conscious so far , officials have been investigating certain meat traders who store large quantities of meat .
in one case , officials said they seized 60 tons of meat from one company called domenz , based in the western city of gelsenkirchen .
in another , investigators found hundreds of tons of waste from slaughterhouses - usually used in dog food - marked as edible for human .
in bonn , inspectors found tons of meat which had expired two years ago . but german officials have n't left consumers off the hook either .
they say that consumers are too price conscious at the expense of quality . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans salute spoiled-meat action plan critics have called for a rapid start to a clean-up plan for the meat-packing industry amid a food scandal that continues to grab headlines - and turn stomachs .

the study , by researchers in newcastle , found children who tested positive for beta-catenin showed a 93 % survival rate without chemotherapy .
it was funded by the samantha dickson trust -lrb- sdt -rrb- , based in hartley wintney .
the charity said it is a " significant finding -lsb- that -rsb- offers the potential for improved quality of life " .
the results came out of a european-wide trial carried out by researchers from the northern institute for cancer research , based at university of newcastle upon tyne . "
we hope this discovery will make a crucial difference for patients " prof david ellison , report author more than 100 patients with a malignant childhood brain tumour were tested for beta-catenin and of them 27 - 25 % - had the protein .
the survival rate amongst those patients was 93 % , compared to 65 % for patients without the protein .
" we hope this discovery will make a crucial difference for patients having treatment for this type of brain tumour in the future , " said report author prof david ellison .
" what was surprising about our results is that the catenin protein had previously been shown to be associated with aggressive behaviour in other cancers . "
rosie clare , nine and from near petersfield , was diagnosed with a brain tumour a year ago .
for the past eight months she has been undergoing chemotherapy .
she has to take three different types of drugs and said it is not an easy treatment .
" i usually feel quite tired and quite achy and my eyes feel very sore and i just do n't really feel like moving , " she said .
' avoid chemotherapy ' her mother lucy , says rosie is coping well , but added : " sometimes the main side effects are actually the symptoms that you do n't necessarily see . "
rosie will probably not be tested for beta-catenin , because she has already started treatment .
but researchers believe that patients who carry the protein could , in the future , be spared unnecessary chemotherapy treatment .
the samantha dickson research trust wants more studies to be carried out into the link and hopes that every child who is diagnosed with a brain tumour can be tested for beta-catenin .

the explosion ripped through the pit in the privately run colliery in tangshan in the north of hebei province .
it was the third fatal accident in two weeks , making a mockery of repeated government vows to improve coal mine safety , a bbc correspondent reports .
china 's mining industry is one of the most dangerous in the world , with more than 6,000 miners dying last year .
this latest accident is just the latest in a grim litany of disasters in china 's coal mines , the bbc 's louisa lim reports from beijing .
china 's government is struggling to clean up the mining industry , announcing repeated safety campaigns .
however , the booming economy has pushed up coal prices , putting mines under pressure to step up production , and mines often operate illegally .
this string of accidents highlights the powerlessness of the central leadership to improve matters , our correspondent says .
' unregistered miners ' the explosion occurred on wednesday at the liuguantun mine near tangshan city , 165km -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- from beijing management at the colliery is very poor and the official number of people registered as being in the mine at the time of the blast was not reliable , xinhua news agency reports , quoting unnamed local authorities .
the formerly state-owned mine has an output of 150,000 tons of coal a year , according to state media .
rescuers are still trying to reach 42 miners who have been trapped below ground since friday after a flood at a mine in central hunan province .
divers have been dispatched and a microphone lowered into the shaft but there is no indication that the men are still alive .
the sigou coal mine had been operating without a safety permit and mine officials fled the scene after the flooding .

eight buses have been refitted with kitchens , bathrooms and living space .
the buses , with solar panels and recycling bins , will be lent to a london homeless charity over christmas .
double decker living , a new london company , aims to provide alternative housing for the homeless and key workers such as nhs staff on call .
the idea for the bus , which can house up to five people , was prompted by the phasing out of the routemaster , the distinctive hop-on , hop-off red london bus .
life skills " the double decker is such an iconic london image , we wanted to see what we could do with it , " said jason hart of double decker living .
" everyone i speak to laughs because it sounds so strange but once they see it for themselves , they become very enthusiastic about the idea . "
for the first stage of the project - to be launched on 19 december - leyland olympian double deckers are being used , but plans are under way for a routemaster version .
centrepoint charity for young homeless people will use the buses as teaching venues for life skills classes , covering topics such as cooking and interview preparation .

by vaughan roderick bbc wales welsh affairs editor the bill is expected to give the assembly more powers on the day the government of wales bill is published , the bbc wales news website looks at the possible impact of the legislation .
just six years after the establishment of the welsh assembly , the fact that the uk government has decided to revisit the issue of welsh devolution amounts to an admission of major problems and failures in the original settlement .
such problems were predicted at the time .
labour 's welsh devolution policy was shaped with one eye on what was to prove a difficult referendum campaign .
compromises aimed at maximising political support and minimising public opposition have proved clumsy in practice .
the new bill is expected to contain a series of measures to strengthen the powers of the assembly and assembly government .
the bill falls short of giving the assembly full scottish-style legislative powers as recommended by the all-party richard commission , although such powers could come in time following a new referendum .
the main proposals in the bill are expected to be : a separation of the roles of the assembly itself and the assembly government .
the original government of wales act gave substantial powers to the assembly itself and its all-party committees in developing and implementing policies .
the new act will see cardiff bay moving to a westminster-style system with government ministers framing policies while the assembly concentrates of scrutiny and legislation .
this is similar to the change seen in most welsh councils over the past decade with a cabinet system replacing the old committee system .
this move is broadly supported by all the parties in the assembly who are frustrated that the assembly as whole is either blamed for or credited with policies that are originated by the governing party .
a new fast-track system assembly members -lrb- ams -rrb- have been frustrated by the so-called " legislative log-jam " in parliament where assembly-prepared legislation has to compete for time with bills prepared by whitehall ministries .
the new system would allow the assembly to draw up legislation following votes in the commons and the lords to approve the principal of the proposed measure .
a mechanism for the assembly to receive full law making powers following a further devolution referendum .
for such a referendum to be triggered a broad consensus would be required in the assembly .
this clause in the bill is seen as crucial by ams who fear that further devolution could be held up by welsh mps worried about a further erosion in their power and influence .
the fourth main proposal is likely to prove the most controversial .
to ensure that the assembly broadly reflects the share of the vote received the forty constituency ams 20 members are elected from regional top up lists .
labour ams have developed a strong dislike of the list system , possibly since no labour ams are elected by this method .
labour in particular are irritated by candidates who lose in constituency contests entering the assembly by what they see as a " back door " .
if the bill is passed unchanged and survives a possible legal challenge under the human rights act , candidates will be prevented from standing in both sections - a move the opposition regards as blatantly partisan .
