it is not a cure , but stops the virus from multiplying and is effective against strains that have become resistant to treatment . the new treatment , developed by scientists at the heinrich pette institute at the university of hamburg and the friedrich alexander university erlangen-nuremberg , takes a slightly different approach to traditional hiv therapies .
while conventional anti-retroviral treatments attempt to block the virus ' own proteins to keep it from replicating , this time researchers have focused on a human protein which the virus needs to make copies of itself .
the strategy targets a protein of a human host cell and blocks a human protein there called dhs , or deoxyhypusine synthase . " by indirectly targeting the virus we can also block viruses that are otherwise resistant against current therapies , " said ilona hauber , the lead scientist on the project . the development was announced and detailed in the current issue of the journal of clinical investigation , an american scientific magazine . numbers climbing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african aids activists almost 40 million people live with the hiv virus or aids and that number is increasing , especially in africa , parts of asian and eastern europe .

get to know yanbei chen , a young chinese scientist who is one of this year ’ s recipients of a prize offered by the humboldt foundation . yanbei chen works at the albert einstein institute in golm , and is trying to prove the great physicist ’ s prediction on gravity waves .
he hopes to have some answers within the next 10 years .
gravity waves are one of the secrets that the universe does not reveal lightly .
they ’ re created when a large body of matter accelerates at tremendous speeds , for example when two black holes meet and meld .
ninety years ago , einstein predicted the occurrence of gravity waves during cataclysmic events like these .
until now , however , no scientists have been able to measure gravity waves directly , because on measuring instruments they only appear as incredibly small shifts in radiation .
the search for gravity waves has developed into an international competition .
in different parts of the world , research facilities have built new , kilometer-long measuring devices known as laser interferometers .
these are able measure deviations in radiation that are a thousand times shorter than an atomic nucleus is wide .
one of these huge detectors has been constructed by a german-british team in hanover , and is run by the experimental department of the nearby albert einstein institute .
yanbei chen ’ ’ s project is focused on optimizing detection techniques , and could help provide a basis for the next generation of gravity wave detectors .

get to know yanbei chen , a young chinese scientist who is one of this year ’ s recipients of a prize offered by the humboldt foundation . yanbei chen works at the albert einstein institute in golm , and is trying to prove the great physicist ’ s prediction on gravity waves .
he hopes to have some answers within the next 10 years .
gravity waves are one of the secrets that the universe does not reveal lightly .
they ’ re created when a large body of matter accelerates at tremendous speeds , for example when two black holes meet and meld .
ninety years ago , einstein predicted the occurrence of gravity waves during cataclysmic events like these .
until now , however , no scientists have been able to measure gravity waves directly , because on measuring instruments they only appear as incredibly small shifts in radiation .
the search for gravity waves has developed into an international competition .
in different parts of the world , research facilities have built new , kilometer-long measuring devices known as laser interferometers .
these are able measure deviations in radiation that are a thousand times shorter than an atomic nucleus is wide .
one of these huge detectors has been constructed by a german-british team in hanover , and is run by the experimental department of the nearby albert einstein institute .
yanbei chen ’ ’ s project is focused on optimizing detection techniques , and could help provide a basis for the next generation of gravity wave detectors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? germany -pipe- 04.01.2005 germany keen on south asia partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn has set up a partnership with the cuddalore district in india chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships . "
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .
20 . however , it remains to be seen whether schröder 's latest proposal of bilateral partnerships will find acceptance within the european union .

"
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .

but since 2001 , the financial sections have read more like the obituaries page .
the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .

" the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .
several have actually lowered their growth forecasts for the coming year . “ we can ’ t expect a lot , ” said joachim scheide , who analyzes business cycles at the kiel institute .
“ unlike some others , we ’ re rather pessimistic . ”
driving factor : exports that pessimism has much to do with the decisive role exports play in the german economy .
much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .
that means demand for exports could sink , which could put a drag on german growth overall . euro , oil prices surge after a year in which the us dollar fell 5 percent against the euro , many are worried that a further climb will prove damaging to the german economy .
the european common currency peaked at $ 1.3667 in december and media outlets in 2004 were full of reports of companies suffering under a rising euro . many worried that the strong euro , along with record high oil prices last year , would nip that europe ’ s nascent recovery in the bud .
but oil prices have stabilized somewhat and european companies have not suffered as much as expected from the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the euro-dollar exchange rate stays around where it is , or even better , drops to around $ 1.30 in 2005 , german exporters should remain competitive enough to succeed in global markets , according to the chambers of commerce . “ we can ’ t ignore it , but we shouldn ’ t overrate it , ” said michael grömling , an analyst with the cologne institute of business research .

others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet . once upon a time , germans were accustomed to reading articles full of hope , enthusiasm and healthy earnings when they ’ d open the business pages of the newspaper .
but since 2001 , the financial sections have read more like the obituaries page .
the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .
only eight said they felt worse off ; the rest reported their mood was unchanged .
the majority said they planned on producing more in 2005 and would increase or at least maintain the level of 2004 investments in the coming year . “ the prospects for the german economy in 2005 are excellent , ” wrote chancellor gerhard schröder in an article in germany ’ s handelsblatt newspaper on thursday . schröder ’ s finance minister echoed the sentiment , telling the financial times : " 2004 was a good year , because the german economy finally moved out of stagnation . " the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .
several have actually lowered their growth forecasts for the coming year . “ we can ’ t expect a lot , ” said joachim scheide , who analyzes business cycles at the kiel institute .
“ unlike some others , we ’ re rather pessimistic . ”
driving factor : exports that pessimism has much to do with the decisive role exports play in the german economy .
much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .
that means demand for exports could sink , which could put a drag on german growth overall . euro , oil prices surge after a year in which the us dollar fell 5 percent against the euro , many are worried that a further climb will prove damaging to the german economy .
the european common currency peaked at $ 1.3667 in december and media outlets in 2004 were full of reports of companies suffering under a rising euro . many worried that the strong euro , along with record high oil prices last year , would nip that europe ’ s nascent recovery in the bud .
but oil prices have stabilized somewhat and european companies have not suffered as much as expected from the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the euro-dollar exchange rate stays around where it is , or even better , drops to around $ 1.30 in 2005 , german exporters should remain competitive enough to succeed in global markets , according to the chambers of commerce . “ we can ’ t ignore it , but we shouldn ’ t overrate it , ” said michael grömling , an analyst with the cologne institute of business research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.01.2005 meeting the challenge of medical aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shipment of medical aid waits to be flown to sumatra europe 's largest medical aid organization , action medeor , has just marked 40 years in operation .
but the south asia tsunami disaster has presented the german organization with a challenge unlike any in its history . when german airline ltu flew planes to the tsunami-affected countries to bring customers home , water purification tablets , mosquito nets , pain medication and antibiotics for 10,000 were also on board the aircraft . the staff at action medeor in krefeld knew which items to pull from the chock-full storage halls , and a new donation campaign was already up and running to finance further deliveries for 40 years , action medeor has dedicated itself to helping in emergency situations , as well as fighting malaria , tuberculosis and aids .
what began spontaneously as a private aid initiative collecting doctors ' medicine samples is today europe 's largest medical aid organization , complete with professional logistics , research , and production facilities on location in africa . on a tour through the storage rooms , the size of the challenge action medeor has taken on quickly becomes clear .
around 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,000 square feet -rrb- are piled high with huge pallets of medication , blankets , bandages and medical equipment .
forklifts are constantly in use as deliveries for 9,000 health care stations in 126 countries are put together and packed for transport . basic right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 40 years that we 've been working as an organization , it 's always been important to us that health be a basic right , " said bernd pastors , the head of action medeor .
" but millions , even billions of people have no access to the most basic elements that make up proper health care .
our task is to work to improve that in cooperation with many other organizations . " action medeor 's story began in 1963 , in the garage of krefeld resident ernst boeker .
at first , the doctor planned to send clothing donations to the third world .
but then dr. boekers had another idea - he would collect doctors ' samples , especially medication , to give to missionary outposts in developing countries . it quickly became clear to boeker that the collected medication did n't always meet the needs of doctors working in africa , asia and latin america , and he was forced to re-think his concept . the breakthrough came when he decided to order the necessary medication from european manufacturers in bulk .
funded by donations , action medeor could then give medicine either for free or at cost to health care stations or other aid agencies .
the concept worked , allowing millions of people in developing countries to receive medication that meets european standards . tsunami challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers pack aid supplies for the tsunami victims forty years on , action medeor 's staff of around 50 is working non-stop to deliver aid to the countries in south asia that were hit by the tsunami disaster .
to work more effectively through this catastrophe , action medeor has joined forces with other aid organizations . on new year 's day , for example , action medeor put together " health kits " meant to supply 10,000 people with necessary items and medication for three months .
and a number of donation drives and tv benefit shows in germany are supposed to ensure that aid organizations are able to carry out their work in the crisis regions in the weeks and months to come . elena beier -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

but the south asia tsunami disaster has presented the german organization with a challenge unlike any in its history . when german airline ltu flew planes to the tsunami-affected countries to bring customers home , water purification tablets , mosquito nets , pain medication and antibiotics for 10,000 were also on board the aircraft . the staff at action medeor in krefeld knew which items to pull from the chock-full storage halls , and a new donation campaign was already up and running to finance further deliveries for 40 years , action medeor has dedicated itself to helping in emergency situations , as well as fighting malaria , tuberculosis and aids .
what began spontaneously as a private aid initiative collecting doctors ' medicine samples is today europe 's largest medical aid organization , complete with professional logistics , research , and production facilities on location in africa . on a tour through the storage rooms , the size of the challenge action medeor has taken on quickly becomes clear .
around 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,000 square feet -rrb- are piled high with huge pallets of medication , blankets , bandages and medical equipment .
forklifts are constantly in use as deliveries for 9,000 health care stations in 126 countries are put together and packed for transport . basic right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 40 years that we 've been working as an organization , it 's always been important to us that health be a basic right , " said bernd pastors , the head of action medeor .
" but millions , even billions of people have no access to the most basic elements that make up proper health care .
our task is to work to improve that in cooperation with many other organizations . " action medeor 's story began in 1963 , in the garage of krefeld resident ernst boeker .
at first , the doctor planned to send clothing donations to the third world .
but then dr. boekers had another idea - he would collect doctors ' samples , especially medication , to give to missionary outposts in developing countries . it quickly became clear to boeker that the collected medication did n't always meet the needs of doctors working in africa , asia and latin america , and he was forced to re-think his concept . the breakthrough came when he decided to order the necessary medication from european manufacturers in bulk .
funded by donations , action medeor could then give medicine either for free or at cost to health care stations or other aid agencies .
the concept worked , allowing millions of people in developing countries to receive medication that meets european standards . tsunami challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers pack aid supplies for the tsunami victims forty years on , action medeor 's staff of around 50 is working non-stop to deliver aid to the countries in south asia that were hit by the tsunami disaster .
to work more effectively through this catastrophe , action medeor has joined forces with other aid organizations . on new year 's day , for example , action medeor put together " health kits " meant to supply 10,000 people with necessary items and medication for three months .
and a number of donation drives and tv benefit shows in germany are supposed to ensure that aid organizations are able to carry out their work in the crisis regions in the weeks and months to come . elena beier -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

26 , 2004 . the epicenter of the undersea quake which triggered massive tidal waves was near the northern tip of indonesia 's sumatra island .
the country 's aceh province , closest to the epicenter , has taken a severe battering with chaotic scenes of destruction and devastation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boeing-737 cargo plane carrying relief supplies lies on its side in the middle of the runway at banda aceh airport after it broke its wheels .
even as aid workers raced to supply food and water to the thousands of refugees on the island , the international relief effort suffered a setback on tuesday after the main airport in banda aceh , the island capital and a key hub for relief flights , was closed to planes .
the closure came after the landing gear of a cargo plane collapsed in the early hours of the morning . fact-finding team in the region despite the setback , the german army has received a go-ahead from the indonesian government to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the aceh province that would enable emergency medical aid and operations for the injured and sick . on saturday , an advance party of nine german soldiers , a so-called fact-finding team set off for aceh , to investigate conditions on the ground , assess the logistical challenges and check accessibility routes for flying in the mobile hospital unit which will be spread out in 40 tents . according to the german defense ministry , 120 german army paramedics will fly out to aceh , which has also been lashed by tropical rains in the aftermath of the disaster , and attend to victims in the field hospital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy 's hospital ship " the berlin " in addition , the german navy 's hospital ship , " berlin , " has also departed for indonesia as have members of the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- to set up a mobile water treatment plant to provide drinking water for sumatra 's civilian population . high-tech hospital the army hospital consists of 22 beds including three for intensive care patients .

the entire maneuver will involve transporting around 350 tons of material , ziad said . the army paramedics will be flown out to aceh as soon as they get a green signal from the advance fact-finding team in the region .
the field hospital is expected to be up and running within two hours of reaching aceh and fully operational in 4 to 8 hours . utter chaos and destruction but , for now , it 's difficult for the group of around 120 german army paramedics who are still awaiting departure to aceh to paint a concrete picture of what awaits them in the crisis region . hartmut siebertz , vice commander of the unit said they were still waiting for assessment reports from the fact-finding team . " but , it 's still very likely that we can expect unimaginably horrible conditions and really difficult working conditions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless acehnese people wait aboard a ship in the port of banda aceh media reports and televised aerial images already speak of untold devastation in the remote parts of aceh province , where roads and airstrips have been washed away and entire towns have been erased from the map . this week , reporters spoke of scenes of utter chaos as thousands of refugees huddled in makeshift tents and the smell of putrefaction and the stench from the strewn debris wafted over the island .
aid workers are already warning of the onset of disease in the face of massive water contamination . fears and doubts some of the german army paramedics like stefanie schwenn from hamburg , admitted that she was nervous of the task ahead . " we were actually all on vacation when we got a call that we should travel back to the base because we were going to asia , " schwenn said .
" what can you say , you simply think , ' oh shit ' in that moment .
yes , it is my first deployment and it 's normal to be a bit scared . " schwenn said that all she knew about the devastation in aceh was what she had gleaned from the media . even sven börg , another paramedic who is preparing to leave for the region , said he expected it to be a harrowing experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an acehnese man looks for relatives among victims of the earthquake in banda aceh " one ca n't really imagine it theoretically , " he said .
" i think , when we actually arrive it , it 's going to be quite a jolt for us to see how everything is destroyed . " despite the fears and doubts , siebertz said he believed that his mobile hospital unit could still provide valuable help to the remaining population . " in the face of the high death toll to say that our aid is just a ' small drop in the ocean ' sounds so negative , " he said .

it is not a cure , but stops the virus from multiplying and is effective against strains that have become resistant to treatment . the new treatment , developed by scientists at the heinrich pette institute at the university of hamburg and the friedrich alexander university erlangen-nuremberg , takes a slightly different approach to traditional hiv therapies .
while conventional anti-retroviral treatments attempt to block the virus ' own proteins to keep it from replicating , this time researchers have focused on a human protein which the virus needs to make copies of itself .
the strategy targets a protein of a human host cell and blocks a human protein there called dhs , or deoxyhypusine synthase . " by indirectly targeting the virus we can also block viruses that are otherwise resistant against current therapies , " said ilona hauber , the lead scientist on the project . the development was announced and detailed in the current issue of the journal of clinical investigation , an american scientific magazine . numbers climbing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african aids activists almost 40 million people live with the hiv virus or aids and that number is increasing , especially in africa , parts of asian and eastern europe .

get to know yanbei chen , a young chinese scientist who is one of this year ’ s recipients of a prize offered by the humboldt foundation . yanbei chen works at the albert einstein institute in golm , and is trying to prove the great physicist ’ s prediction on gravity waves .
he hopes to have some answers within the next 10 years .
gravity waves are one of the secrets that the universe does not reveal lightly .
they ’ re created when a large body of matter accelerates at tremendous speeds , for example when two black holes meet and meld .
ninety years ago , einstein predicted the occurrence of gravity waves during cataclysmic events like these .
until now , however , no scientists have been able to measure gravity waves directly , because on measuring instruments they only appear as incredibly small shifts in radiation .
the search for gravity waves has developed into an international competition .
in different parts of the world , research facilities have built new , kilometer-long measuring devices known as laser interferometers .
these are able measure deviations in radiation that are a thousand times shorter than an atomic nucleus is wide .
one of these huge detectors has been constructed by a german-british team in hanover , and is run by the experimental department of the nearby albert einstein institute .
yanbei chen ’ ’ s project is focused on optimizing detection techniques , and could help provide a basis for the next generation of gravity wave detectors .

get to know yanbei chen , a young chinese scientist who is one of this year ’ s recipients of a prize offered by the humboldt foundation . yanbei chen works at the albert einstein institute in golm , and is trying to prove the great physicist ’ s prediction on gravity waves .
he hopes to have some answers within the next 10 years .
gravity waves are one of the secrets that the universe does not reveal lightly .
they ’ re created when a large body of matter accelerates at tremendous speeds , for example when two black holes meet and meld .
ninety years ago , einstein predicted the occurrence of gravity waves during cataclysmic events like these .
until now , however , no scientists have been able to measure gravity waves directly , because on measuring instruments they only appear as incredibly small shifts in radiation .
the search for gravity waves has developed into an international competition .
in different parts of the world , research facilities have built new , kilometer-long measuring devices known as laser interferometers .
these are able measure deviations in radiation that are a thousand times shorter than an atomic nucleus is wide .
one of these huge detectors has been constructed by a german-british team in hanover , and is run by the experimental department of the nearby albert einstein institute .
yanbei chen ’ ’ s project is focused on optimizing detection techniques , and could help provide a basis for the next generation of gravity wave detectors .
the new laser interferometers would help illuminate the darkest parts of space , giving us a better understanding of the development of the universe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 einstein year news the einstein tower einstein spaces © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

get to know yanbei chen , a young chinese scientist who is one of this year ’ s recipients of a prize offered by the humboldt foundation . yanbei chen works at the albert einstein institute in golm , and is trying to prove the great physicist ’ s prediction on gravity waves .
he hopes to have some answers within the next 10 years .
gravity waves are one of the secrets that the universe does not reveal lightly .
they ’ re created when a large body of matter accelerates at tremendous speeds , for example when two black holes meet and meld .
ninety years ago , einstein predicted the occurrence of gravity waves during cataclysmic events like these .
until now , however , no scientists have been able to measure gravity waves directly , because on measuring instruments they only appear as incredibly small shifts in radiation .
the search for gravity waves has developed into an international competition .
in different parts of the world , research facilities have built new , kilometer-long measuring devices known as laser interferometers .
these are able measure deviations in radiation that are a thousand times shorter than an atomic nucleus is wide .
one of these huge detectors has been constructed by a german-british team in hanover , and is run by the experimental department of the nearby albert einstein institute .
yanbei chen ’ ’ s project is focused on optimizing detection techniques , and could help provide a basis for the next generation of gravity wave detectors .
the new laser interferometers would help illuminate the darkest parts of space , giving us a better understanding of the development of the universe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 einstein year news the einstein tower einstein spaces © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 04.01.2005 economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 back to first page back 2/2 reform cheer one reason behind the new optimism among industry leaders is the schröder government ’ s controversial labor market reforms that have now gone into effect .
they are aimed at boosting the economy and putting a dent in german ’ s unemployment rate , now at over 10 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reforms sparked street protests this summer .
“ the reform program in germany has improved the business mood here substantially , ” said grömling . most economists don ’ t expect the reforms to have a big effect in 2005 , but they say it might cause a small improvement in the labor market and set the foundation for a larger turnaround in 2006 . that , in turn , could improve consumer spending , which has been the achilles ' heel of the german economy for several years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ consumption goes hand in hand with labor market developments , ” said grömling .
“ it wo n't get worse ; it could get better . ” still lagging behind although there is some cautious optimism going around these days , it 's not shared by everyone .
the world economy is growing faster than it has in 28 years , but the german economy is not part of it , complain economists at munich ’ s ifo economics institute and several leading banks . “ germany is disconnected from the world , ” said martin hüfner , chief economist at the hypovereinsbank in his new year ’ s commentary .
“ no other country in central or western europe has grown as slowly between 1995 and 2004 . ” while germany used to be called europe ’ s economic powerhouse , these days caboose is more like it . despite the improvements , some economists say the last-place position is not likely to change . joachim scheide from the kiel institute says for that to happen , berlin is going to have to institute far-reaching reforms and consider a more aggressive strategy for boosting growth .
“ we need the state to invest more and to really lower taxes so that the private sector has breathing room , ” he said .
“ 2005 might turn out to be a slight improvement over last year , but more simply must be done . ” kyle james , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moaning and groaning germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .

while conventional anti-retroviral treatments attempt to block the virus ' own proteins to keep it from replicating , this time researchers have focused on a human protein which the virus needs to make copies of itself .
the strategy targets a protein of a human host cell and blocks a human protein there called dhs , or deoxyhypusine synthase .

26 , 2004 . the epicenter of the undersea quake which triggered massive tidal waves was near the northern tip of indonesia 's sumatra island .
the country 's aceh province , closest to the epicenter , has taken a severe battering with chaotic scenes of destruction and devastation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boeing-737 cargo plane carrying relief supplies lies on its side in the middle of the runway at banda aceh airport after it broke its wheels .
even as aid workers raced to supply food and water to the thousands of refugees on the island , the international relief effort suffered a setback on tuesday after the main airport in banda aceh , the island capital and a key hub for relief flights , was closed to planes .
the closure came after the landing gear of a cargo plane collapsed in the early hours of the morning . fact-finding team in the region despite the setback , the german army has received a go-ahead from the indonesian government to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the aceh province that would enable emergency medical aid and operations for the injured and sick . on saturday , an advance party of nine german soldiers , a so-called fact-finding team set off for aceh , to investigate conditions on the ground , assess the logistical challenges and check accessibility routes for flying in the mobile hospital unit which will be spread out in 40 tents . according to the german defense ministry , 120 german army paramedics will fly out to aceh , which has also been lashed by tropical rains in the aftermath of the disaster , and attend to victims in the field hospital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy 's hospital ship " the berlin " in addition , the german navy 's hospital ship , " berlin , " has also departed for indonesia as have members of the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- to set up a mobile water treatment plant to provide drinking water for sumatra 's civilian population . high-tech hospital the army hospital consists of 22 beds including three for intensive care patients .
this basic unit is meant above all to provide emergency medical aid to the population .
paramedics are expected to tour the region and provide first aid where needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a part of the mobile field hospital the more sophisticated elements of the field hospital include ultrasound machinery , x-rays and laboratory equipment which can help in diagnosing tropical illnesses as well as an on board pharmaceutical and medical supplies depot . jurdi ziad , who will head " mission aceh , " told german public broadcaster ndr that the mobile field hospital also enabled surgeons to perform emergency operations , up to 20 a day .
the entire maneuver will involve transporting around 350 tons of material , ziad said . the army paramedics will be flown out to aceh as soon as they get a green signal from the advance fact-finding team in the region .
the field hospital is expected to be up and running within two hours of reaching aceh and fully operational in 4 to 8 hours . utter chaos and destruction but , for now , it 's difficult for the group of around 120 german army paramedics who are still awaiting departure to aceh to paint a concrete picture of what awaits them in the crisis region . hartmut siebertz , vice commander of the unit said they were still waiting for assessment reports from the fact-finding team . " but , it 's still very likely that we can expect unimaginably horrible conditions and really difficult working conditions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless acehnese people wait aboard a ship in the port of banda aceh media reports and televised aerial images already speak of untold devastation in the remote parts of aceh province , where roads and airstrips have been washed away and entire towns have been erased from the map . this week , reporters spoke of scenes of utter chaos as thousands of refugees huddled in makeshift tents and the smell of putrefaction and the stench from the strewn debris wafted over the island .
aid workers are already warning of the onset of disease in the face of massive water contamination . fears and doubts some of the german army paramedics like stefanie schwenn from hamburg , admitted that she was nervous of the task ahead . " we were actually all on vacation when we got a call that we should travel back to the base because we were going to asia , " schwenn said .
" what can you say , you simply think , ' oh shit ' in that moment .
yes , it is my first deployment and it 's normal to be a bit scared . " schwenn said that all she knew about the devastation in aceh was what she had gleaned from the media . even sven börg , another paramedic who is preparing to leave for the region , said he expected it to be a harrowing experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an acehnese man looks for relatives among victims of the earthquake in banda aceh " one ca n't really imagine it theoretically , " he said .
" i think , when we actually arrive it , it 's going to be quite a jolt for us to see how everything is destroyed . " despite the fears and doubts , siebertz said he believed that his mobile hospital unit could still provide valuable help to the remaining population . " in the face of the high death toll to say that our aid is just a ' small drop in the ocean ' sounds so negative , " he said .
" that 's not how i would assess it .

but among the up and coming locations are several cities in the former east . of all german cities , munich has the best economic perspectives , with stuttgart , düsseldorf , hamburg and heidelberg following behind closely , according to a recent ranking published in capital magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's townhall and church of our lady analysts at the bad homburg institute of economics evaluated 60 of germany ’ s biggest cities in terms of growth , employment figures , population and purchasing power and predicted how they would develop between 2002 and 2011 . the top 10 cities are all located in the western part of the country , and include cultural and financial centers such as cologne , frankfurt , wiesbaden and the former capital bonn .
berlin , which is struggling with high unemployment and declining investment , ranked only 32nd on the list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial ruhr region in germany 's northwest is declining in economic potential as heavy industry and mining shut down the industrial rhine-ruhr region , comprising cities such as dortmund , bochum and duisburg , showed the biggest decline in economic indicators compared to a 2002 ranking .
bochum fell nine places down to position 38 ; krefeld dropped down to 48 and essen – the biggest loser in the west – tumbled from 21 to 34 .
population decline and unemployment contributed significantly to the lower ranking . improvements in the east surprising was the number of eastern cities which made it into the top 60 .
compared to a similar ranking two years ago , four more cities made it onto the list .
the top among the eastern metropolises was dresden , which moved up from spot 34 to 14 .
leipzig improved the most , jumping from 43 to 19 .
jena climbed up 20 points to position 21 and potsdam surpassed neighboring berlin to end up in position 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwerin on the baltic sea might be a nice tourist destination , but it 's not attracting a lot of investment while the former east has its bright spots , particularly in the cities such as leipzig and dresden where high tech companies are beginning to invest , the region still has its downside .
the last five positions in the city ranking were all taken up by eastern cities : magdeburg , rostock , chemnitz , halle / saale and schwerin . the difference between the top and bottom of the list is particularly dramatic in terms of forecast for the next several years .
while the economic potential of munich increases by 25 percent , schwerin is only expected to grow by about 7 percent . cities beat out countryside overall , german cities proved to be the most dynamic in terms of boosting germany ’ s economy .
whereas urban areas are expected to produce an average growth rate of 18.9 percent , the rest of the country is only likely to turn out figures around 14 percent . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deconstructing germany due to a weak economy , falling birthrates and higher numbers of people relocating to find jobs , some german regions are losing population ; their cities are shrinking .

gravity waves are one of the secrets that the universe does not reveal lightly .

ninety years ago , einstein predicted the occurrence of gravity waves during cataclysmic events like these .

these are able measure deviations in radiation that are a thousand times shorter than an atomic nucleus is wide .

get to know yanbei chen , a young chinese scientist who is one of this year ’ s recipients of a prize offered by the humboldt foundation . yanbei chen works at the albert einstein institute in golm , and is trying to prove the great physicist ’ s prediction on gravity waves .
he hopes to have some answers within the next 10 years .
gravity waves are one of the secrets that the universe does not reveal lightly .
they ’ re created when a large body of matter accelerates at tremendous speeds , for example when two black holes meet and meld .
ninety years ago , einstein predicted the occurrence of gravity waves during cataclysmic events like these .
until now , however , no scientists have been able to measure gravity waves directly , because on measuring instruments they only appear as incredibly small shifts in radiation .
the search for gravity waves has developed into an international competition .
in different parts of the world , research facilities have built new , kilometer-long measuring devices known as laser interferometers .
these are able measure deviations in radiation that are a thousand times shorter than an atomic nucleus is wide .

but among the up and coming locations are several cities in the former east . of all german cities , munich has the best economic perspectives , with stuttgart , düsseldorf , hamburg and heidelberg following behind closely , according to a recent ranking published in capital magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's townhall and church of our lady analysts at the bad homburg institute of economics evaluated 60 of germany ’ s biggest cities in terms of growth , employment figures , population and purchasing power and predicted how they would develop between 2002 and 2011 . the top 10 cities are all located in the western part of the country , and include cultural and financial centers such as cologne , frankfurt , wiesbaden and the former capital bonn .
berlin , which is struggling with high unemployment and declining investment , ranked only 32nd on the list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial ruhr region in germany 's northwest is declining in economic potential as heavy industry and mining shut down the industrial rhine-ruhr region , comprising cities such as dortmund , bochum and duisburg , showed the biggest decline in economic indicators compared to a 2002 ranking .
bochum fell nine places down to position 38 ; krefeld dropped down to 48 and essen – the biggest loser in the west – tumbled from 21 to 34 .
population decline and unemployment contributed significantly to the lower ranking . improvements in the east surprising was the number of eastern cities which made it into the top 60 .
compared to a similar ranking two years ago , four more cities made it onto the list .
the top among the eastern metropolises was dresden , which moved up from spot 34 to 14 .
leipzig improved the most , jumping from 43 to 19 .
jena climbed up 20 points to position 21 and potsdam surpassed neighboring berlin to end up in position 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwerin on the baltic sea might be a nice tourist destination , but it 's not attracting a lot of investment while the former east has its bright spots , particularly in the cities such as leipzig and dresden where high tech companies are beginning to invest , the region still has its downside .
the last five positions in the city ranking were all taken up by eastern cities : magdeburg , rostock , chemnitz , halle / saale and schwerin . the difference between the top and bottom of the list is particularly dramatic in terms of forecast for the next several years .
while the economic potential of munich increases by 25 percent , schwerin is only expected to grow by about 7 percent . cities beat out countryside overall , german cities proved to be the most dynamic in terms of boosting germany ’ s economy .
whereas urban areas are expected to produce an average growth rate of 18.9 percent , the rest of the country is only likely to turn out figures around 14 percent . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deconstructing germany due to a weak economy , falling birthrates and higher numbers of people relocating to find jobs , some german regions are losing population ; their cities are shrinking .

what began spontaneously as a private aid initiative collecting doctors ' medicine samples is today europe 's largest medical aid organization , complete with professional logistics , research , and production facilities on location in africa . on a tour through the storage rooms , the size of the challenge action medeor has taken on quickly becomes clear .

but the south asia tsunami disaster has presented the german organization with a challenge unlike any in its history . when german airline ltu flew planes to the tsunami-affected countries to bring customers home , water purification tablets , mosquito nets , pain medication and antibiotics for 10,000 were also on board the aircraft . the staff at action medeor in krefeld knew which items to pull from the chock-full storage halls , and a new donation campaign was already up and running to finance further deliveries for 40 years , action medeor has dedicated itself to helping in emergency situations , as well as fighting malaria , tuberculosis and aids .
what began spontaneously as a private aid initiative collecting doctors ' medicine samples is today europe 's largest medical aid organization , complete with professional logistics , research , and production facilities on location in africa . on a tour through the storage rooms , the size of the challenge action medeor has taken on quickly becomes clear .
around 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,000 square feet -rrb- are piled high with huge pallets of medication , blankets , bandages and medical equipment .
forklifts are constantly in use as deliveries for 9,000 health care stations in 126 countries are put together and packed for transport . basic right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 40 years that we 've been working as an organization , it 's always been important to us that health be a basic right , " said bernd pastors , the head of action medeor .
" but millions , even billions of people have no access to the most basic elements that make up proper health care .
our task is to work to improve that in cooperation with many other organizations . " action medeor 's story began in 1963 , in the garage of krefeld resident ernst boeker .
at first , the doctor planned to send clothing donations to the third world .
but then dr. boekers had another idea - he would collect doctors ' samples , especially medication , to give to missionary outposts in developing countries . it quickly became clear to boeker that the collected medication did n't always meet the needs of doctors working in africa , asia and latin america , and he was forced to re-think his concept . the breakthrough came when he decided to order the necessary medication from european manufacturers in bulk .
funded by donations , action medeor could then give medicine either for free or at cost to health care stations or other aid agencies .
the concept worked , allowing millions of people in developing countries to receive medication that meets european standards . tsunami challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers pack aid supplies for the tsunami victims forty years on , action medeor 's staff of around 50 is working non-stop to deliver aid to the countries in south asia that were hit by the tsunami disaster .
to work more effectively through this catastrophe , action medeor has joined forces with other aid organizations . on new year 's day , for example , action medeor put together " health kits " meant to supply 10,000 people with necessary items and medication for three months .
and a number of donation drives and tv benefit shows in germany are supposed to ensure that aid organizations are able to carry out their work in the crisis regions in the weeks and months to come . elena beier -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

but then dr. boekers had another idea - he would collect doctors ' samples , especially medication , to give to missionary outposts in developing countries . it quickly became clear to boeker that the collected medication did n't always meet the needs of doctors working in africa , asia and latin america , and he was forced to re-think his concept . the breakthrough came when he decided to order the necessary medication from european manufacturers in bulk .
funded by donations , action medeor could then give medicine either for free or at cost to health care stations or other aid agencies .
the concept worked , allowing millions of people in developing countries to receive medication that meets european standards . tsunami challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers pack aid supplies for the tsunami victims forty years on , action medeor 's staff of around 50 is working non-stop to deliver aid to the countries in south asia that were hit by the tsunami disaster .

but the south asia tsunami disaster has presented the german organization with a challenge unlike any in its history . when german airline ltu flew planes to the tsunami-affected countries to bring customers home , water purification tablets , mosquito nets , pain medication and antibiotics for 10,000 were also on board the aircraft . the staff at action medeor in krefeld knew which items to pull from the chock-full storage halls , and a new donation campaign was already up and running to finance further deliveries for 40 years , action medeor has dedicated itself to helping in emergency situations , as well as fighting malaria , tuberculosis and aids .
what began spontaneously as a private aid initiative collecting doctors ' medicine samples is today europe 's largest medical aid organization , complete with professional logistics , research , and production facilities on location in africa . on a tour through the storage rooms , the size of the challenge action medeor has taken on quickly becomes clear .
around 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,000 square feet -rrb- are piled high with huge pallets of medication , blankets , bandages and medical equipment .
forklifts are constantly in use as deliveries for 9,000 health care stations in 126 countries are put together and packed for transport . basic right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 40 years that we 've been working as an organization , it 's always been important to us that health be a basic right , " said bernd pastors , the head of action medeor .
" but millions , even billions of people have no access to the most basic elements that make up proper health care .
our task is to work to improve that in cooperation with many other organizations . " action medeor 's story began in 1963 , in the garage of krefeld resident ernst boeker .

the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .

much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .

the european common currency peaked at $ 1.3667 in december and media outlets in 2004 were full of reports of companies suffering under a rising euro . many worried that the strong euro , along with record high oil prices last year , would nip that europe ’ s nascent recovery in the bud .

the majority said they planned on producing more in 2005 and would increase or at least maintain the level of 2004 investments in the coming year . “ the prospects for the german economy in 2005 are excellent , ” wrote chancellor gerhard schröder in an article in germany ’ s handelsblatt newspaper on thursday . schröder ’ s finance minister echoed the sentiment , telling the financial times : " 2004 was a good year , because the german economy finally moved out of stagnation . " the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .
several have actually lowered their growth forecasts for the coming year . “ we can ’ t expect a lot , ” said joachim scheide , who analyzes business cycles at the kiel institute .
“ unlike some others , we ’ re rather pessimistic . ”
driving factor : exports that pessimism has much to do with the decisive role exports play in the german economy .
much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .
that means demand for exports could sink , which could put a drag on german growth overall . euro , oil prices surge after a year in which the us dollar fell 5 percent against the euro , many are worried that a further climb will prove damaging to the german economy .
the european common currency peaked at $ 1.3667 in december and media outlets in 2004 were full of reports of companies suffering under a rising euro . many worried that the strong euro , along with record high oil prices last year , would nip that europe ’ s nascent recovery in the bud .
but oil prices have stabilized somewhat and european companies have not suffered as much as expected from the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the euro-dollar exchange rate stays around where it is , or even better , drops to around $ 1.30 in 2005 , german exporters should remain competitive enough to succeed in global markets , according to the chambers of commerce . “ we can ’ t ignore it , but we shouldn ’ t overrate it , ” said michael grömling , an analyst with the cologne institute of business research .

but the south asia tsunami disaster has presented the german organization with a challenge unlike any in its history . when german airline ltu flew planes to the tsunami-affected countries to bring customers home , water purification tablets , mosquito nets , pain medication and antibiotics for 10,000 were also on board the aircraft . the staff at action medeor in krefeld knew which items to pull from the chock-full storage halls , and a new donation campaign was already up and running to finance further deliveries for 40 years , action medeor has dedicated itself to helping in emergency situations , as well as fighting malaria , tuberculosis and aids .
what began spontaneously as a private aid initiative collecting doctors ' medicine samples is today europe 's largest medical aid organization , complete with professional logistics , research , and production facilities on location in africa . on a tour through the storage rooms , the size of the challenge action medeor has taken on quickly becomes clear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? germany -pipe- 04.01.2005 germany keen on south asia partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn has set up a partnership with the cuddalore district in india chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships . "
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .
20 . however , it remains to be seen whether schröder 's latest proposal of bilateral partnerships will find acceptance within the european union .

"
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .
20 . however , it remains to be seen whether schröder 's latest proposal of bilateral partnerships will find acceptance within the european union .

"
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .

our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.01.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc german unemployment at record high the number of people looking for work in germany , the biggest eurozone economy , rose to its highest level in seven years as the bad weather and sluggish growth caused unemployment to swell at the end of last year , official data showed tuesday .
the bundesbank calculated that the seasonally adjusted jobless total rose by 17,000 to 4.483 million - or 10.8 percent of the workforce - last month , the highest level since dec .
1997 .
the annual average jobless total for 2004 rose by 4,300 to 4.381 million , 10.5 percent of the working population .
analysts predict the unadjusted jobless total could rise to five million in the next months , partially owing to new labor market reforms starting jan .
1 .
under the controversial " hartz iv " reforms , the current two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed is being replaced with a single flat-rate payout , which means that a larger number of people will be classified as looking for work .
" that means that the number of job-seekers will rise in the january statistics , " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said monday .
" but it is important to stress that there wo n't actually be more people without a job than before .
this is purely a statistical effect .
during the course of the year , i expect the jobless total to begin to fall gradually . " dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .
others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet .

the bundesbank calculated that the seasonally adjusted jobless total rose by 17,000 to 4.483 million - or 10.8 percent of the workforce - last month , the highest level since dec .
1997 .
the annual average jobless total for 2004 rose by 4,300 to 4.381 million , 10.5 percent of the working population .
analysts predict the unadjusted jobless total could rise to five million in the next months , partially owing to new labor market reforms starting jan .

under the controversial " hartz iv " reforms , the current two-tier system of unemployment benefits and welfare support for the long-term unemployed is being replaced with a single flat-rate payout , which means that a larger number of people will be classified as looking for work .
" that means that the number of job-seekers will rise in the january statistics , " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement said monday .
" but it is important to stress that there wo n't actually be more people without a job than before .
this is purely a statistical effect .
during the course of the year , i expect the jobless total to begin to fall gradually . " dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .
others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 04.01.2005 economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping it 'll keep rising after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .
others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet . once upon a time , germans were accustomed to reading articles full of hope , enthusiasm and healthy earnings when they ’ d open the business pages of the newspaper .
but since 2001 , the financial sections have read more like the obituaries page .
the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .
only eight said they felt worse off ; the rest reported their mood was unchanged .
the majority said they planned on producing more in 2005 and would increase or at least maintain the level of 2004 investments in the coming year . “ the prospects for the german economy in 2005 are excellent , ” wrote chancellor gerhard schröder in an article in germany ’ s handelsblatt newspaper on thursday . schröder ’ s finance minister echoed the sentiment , telling the financial times : " 2004 was a good year , because the german economy finally moved out of stagnation . " the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .
several have actually lowered their growth forecasts for the coming year . “ we can ’ t expect a lot , ” said joachim scheide , who analyzes business cycles at the kiel institute .
“ unlike some others , we ’ re rather pessimistic . ”
driving factor : exports that pessimism has much to do with the decisive role exports play in the german economy .
much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 04.01.2005 economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping it 'll keep rising after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .
others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet . once upon a time , germans were accustomed to reading articles full of hope , enthusiasm and healthy earnings when they ’ d open the business pages of the newspaper .
but since 2001 , the financial sections have read more like the obituaries page .
the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .
only eight said they felt worse off ; the rest reported their mood was unchanged .
the majority said they planned on producing more in 2005 and would increase or at least maintain the level of 2004 investments in the coming year . “ the prospects for the german economy in 2005 are excellent , ” wrote chancellor gerhard schröder in an article in germany ’ s handelsblatt newspaper on thursday . schröder ’ s finance minister echoed the sentiment , telling the financial times : " 2004 was a good year , because the german economy finally moved out of stagnation . " the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .
several have actually lowered their growth forecasts for the coming year . “ we can ’ t expect a lot , ” said joachim scheide , who analyzes business cycles at the kiel institute .
“ unlike some others , we ’ re rather pessimistic . ”
driving factor : exports that pessimism has much to do with the decisive role exports play in the german economy .
much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .

26 , 2004 . the epicenter of the undersea quake which triggered massive tidal waves was near the northern tip of indonesia 's sumatra island .
the country 's aceh province , closest to the epicenter , has taken a severe battering with chaotic scenes of destruction and devastation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boeing-737 cargo plane carrying relief supplies lies on its side in the middle of the runway at banda aceh airport after it broke its wheels .
even as aid workers raced to supply food and water to the thousands of refugees on the island , the international relief effort suffered a setback on tuesday after the main airport in banda aceh , the island capital and a key hub for relief flights , was closed to planes .
the closure came after the landing gear of a cargo plane collapsed in the early hours of the morning . fact-finding team in the region despite the setback , the german army has received a go-ahead from the indonesian government to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the aceh province that would enable emergency medical aid and operations for the injured and sick . on saturday , an advance party of nine german soldiers , a so-called fact-finding team set off for aceh , to investigate conditions on the ground , assess the logistical challenges and check accessibility routes for flying in the mobile hospital unit which will be spread out in 40 tents . according to the german defense ministry , 120 german army paramedics will fly out to aceh , which has also been lashed by tropical rains in the aftermath of the disaster , and attend to victims in the field hospital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy 's hospital ship " the berlin " in addition , the german navy 's hospital ship , " berlin , " has also departed for indonesia as have members of the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- to set up a mobile water treatment plant to provide drinking water for sumatra 's civilian population . high-tech hospital the army hospital consists of 22 beds including three for intensive care patients .
this basic unit is meant above all to provide emergency medical aid to the population .
paramedics are expected to tour the region and provide first aid where needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a part of the mobile field hospital the more sophisticated elements of the field hospital include ultrasound machinery , x-rays and laboratory equipment which can help in diagnosing tropical illnesses as well as an on board pharmaceutical and medical supplies depot . jurdi ziad , who will head " mission aceh , " told german public broadcaster ndr that the mobile field hospital also enabled surgeons to perform emergency operations , up to 20 a day .
the entire maneuver will involve transporting around 350 tons of material , ziad said . the army paramedics will be flown out to aceh as soon as they get a green signal from the advance fact-finding team in the region .
the field hospital is expected to be up and running within two hours of reaching aceh and fully operational in 4 to 8 hours . utter chaos and destruction but , for now , it 's difficult for the group of around 120 german army paramedics who are still awaiting departure to aceh to paint a concrete picture of what awaits them in the crisis region . hartmut siebertz , vice commander of the unit said they were still waiting for assessment reports from the fact-finding team . " but , it 's still very likely that we can expect unimaginably horrible conditions and really difficult working conditions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless acehnese people wait aboard a ship in the port of banda aceh media reports and televised aerial images already speak of untold devastation in the remote parts of aceh province , where roads and airstrips have been washed away and entire towns have been erased from the map . this week , reporters spoke of scenes of utter chaos as thousands of refugees huddled in makeshift tents and the smell of putrefaction and the stench from the strewn debris wafted over the island .
aid workers are already warning of the onset of disease in the face of massive water contamination . fears and doubts some of the german army paramedics like stefanie schwenn from hamburg , admitted that she was nervous of the task ahead . " we were actually all on vacation when we got a call that we should travel back to the base because we were going to asia , " schwenn said .
" what can you say , you simply think , ' oh shit ' in that moment .
yes , it is my first deployment and it 's normal to be a bit scared . " schwenn said that all she knew about the devastation in aceh was what she had gleaned from the media . even sven börg , another paramedic who is preparing to leave for the region , said he expected it to be a harrowing experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an acehnese man looks for relatives among victims of the earthquake in banda aceh " one ca n't really imagine it theoretically , " he said .
" i think , when we actually arrive it , it 's going to be quite a jolt for us to see how everything is destroyed . " despite the fears and doubts , siebertz said he believed that his mobile hospital unit could still provide valuable help to the remaining population . " in the face of the high death toll to say that our aid is just a ' small drop in the ocean ' sounds so negative , " he said .
" that 's not how i would assess it .

"
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .

" we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes .

" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .

in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .

the small port town aims to show it 's the country 's secret capital . wherever you go in cork , it smells like the sea .
when the high tide pushes the river back into the city , the salty scent of the nearby ocean hangs in the air . almost all the major ocean liners dropped anchor in cork on their way to america in the late 18th and early 19th centuries .
the titanic started its final journey here .
thousands of ships took more than 3 million irish emigrants to america .
those who stayed faced hardship and repressive english colonial powers . " cork was always known as a city of rebels , " city guide noreen explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city view of cork seen from shandon cork is many things - a city of canals , poets , artists , sailors , huguenots and jews .
the fateful year of 1920 also left an indelible mark on the city as on the rest of ireland .
when the corkonians refused to submit to their colonial masters any longer , british troops killed the mayor and burned down the city center .
his majesty 's taxpayers later had to finance the city 's reconstruction .
urban renewal the past decade has also been one of renewal for cork .
the city center got a facelift , thanks largely to catalonian architect beth gali .
gali put an end to ugly , cramped streets by creating numerous new squares , paving sidewalks with creative patterns and designing streetlamps that stretch towards the sky like cranes .
tight , congested roads no longer define cork 's image . " europe must regenerate itself from the fringes to the inside , not from the center to the outside , " shane malone of cork 2005 said in explaining the organizers ' aims for the year of culture .
" we are a small city on europe 's fringes , but we can offer a lot to the continent 's cultural life . " the 4,000 events planned for the year include folk , choral , jazz and pipe organ festivals as well as film showings and literature competitions .
poets from the 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 will read their works .
new plays , sporting events , a chess tournament and cultural offerings from schools and ethnic groups are on the program . " as a port city , we 're traditionally open to new things , " malone said .
showing its stuff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city view of cork with the high street it 's said of ireland that every fourth building is a church and every third is a bar .
in cork , there are perhaps fewer churches , but several more bars .
the local scene is meant to dominate center stage during the year of culture , but some " big " names will also show their stuff .
architect daniel libeskind is set to give a talk and a pavilion he designed will be opened in the city park in the summer . " cork will have the unique opportunity to demonstrate its cultural significance on the international stage , " mary mccarthy , cork 2005 program director said .
" the designation as cultural capital was the catalyst for the city 's rejuvenation .
the legacy will endure . " so far , cork - with around 130,000 inhabitants - is the smallest city to be named european capital of culture since the eu created the title in 1985 .
amsterdam , avignon , bologna , glasgow , graz and weimar are among its predecessors .
but compared to the other cities , cork is working with a relatively modest budget : € 13.5 million .
liverpool will have around € 100 million to spend when it celebrates 2008 as europe 's cultural capital . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ireland snuffs out smoking in workplaces ireland is the first european country to implement a wide-reaching ban on smoking in public places .

but among the up and coming locations are several cities in the former east . of all german cities , munich has the best economic perspectives , with stuttgart , düsseldorf , hamburg and heidelberg following behind closely , according to a recent ranking published in capital magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's townhall and church of our lady analysts at the bad homburg institute of economics evaluated 60 of germany ’ s biggest cities in terms of growth , employment figures , population and purchasing power and predicted how they would develop between 2002 and 2011 . the top 10 cities are all located in the western part of the country , and include cultural and financial centers such as cologne , frankfurt , wiesbaden and the former capital bonn .
berlin , which is struggling with high unemployment and declining investment , ranked only 32nd on the list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial ruhr region in germany 's northwest is declining in economic potential as heavy industry and mining shut down the industrial rhine-ruhr region , comprising cities such as dortmund , bochum and duisburg , showed the biggest decline in economic indicators compared to a 2002 ranking .
bochum fell nine places down to position 38 ; krefeld dropped down to 48 and essen – the biggest loser in the west – tumbled from 21 to 34 .
population decline and unemployment contributed significantly to the lower ranking . improvements in the east surprising was the number of eastern cities which made it into the top 60 .
compared to a similar ranking two years ago , four more cities made it onto the list .
the top among the eastern metropolises was dresden , which moved up from spot 34 to 14 .
leipzig improved the most , jumping from 43 to 19 .

the last five positions in the city ranking were all taken up by eastern cities : magdeburg , rostock , chemnitz , halle / saale and schwerin . the difference between the top and bottom of the list is particularly dramatic in terms of forecast for the next several years .
while the economic potential of munich increases by 25 percent , schwerin is only expected to grow by about 7 percent . cities beat out countryside overall , german cities proved to be the most dynamic in terms of boosting germany ’ s economy .
whereas urban areas are expected to produce an average growth rate of 18.9 percent , the rest of the country is only likely to turn out figures around 14 percent . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deconstructing germany due to a weak economy , falling birthrates and higher numbers of people relocating to find jobs , some german regions are losing population ; their cities are shrinking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? germany -pipe- 04.01.2005 germany keen on south asia partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn has set up a partnership with the cuddalore district in india chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships . "
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .

"
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach .

others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet . once upon a time , germans were accustomed to reading articles full of hope , enthusiasm and healthy earnings when they ’ d open the business pages of the newspaper .
but since 2001 , the financial sections have read more like the obituaries page .
the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .

the majority said they planned on producing more in 2005 and would increase or at least maintain the level of 2004 investments in the coming year . “ the prospects for the german economy in 2005 are excellent , ” wrote chancellor gerhard schröder in an article in germany ’ s handelsblatt newspaper on thursday . schröder ’ s finance minister echoed the sentiment , telling the financial times : " 2004 was a good year , because the german economy finally moved out of stagnation . " the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .

much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .

the european common currency peaked at $ 1.3667 in december and media outlets in 2004 were full of reports of companies suffering under a rising euro . many worried that the strong euro , along with record high oil prices last year , would nip that europe ’ s nascent recovery in the bud .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? germany -pipe- 04.01.2005 germany keen on south asia partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn has set up a partnership with the cuddalore district in india chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships . "
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .
20 . however , it remains to be seen whether schröder 's latest proposal of bilateral partnerships will find acceptance within the european union .
the chancellor is expected to float the idea during a meeting of eu development ministers on friday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

but among the up and coming locations are several cities in the former east . of all german cities , munich has the best economic perspectives , with stuttgart , düsseldorf , hamburg and heidelberg following behind closely , according to a recent ranking published in capital magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view of munich 's townhall and church of our lady analysts at the bad homburg institute of economics evaluated 60 of germany ’ s biggest cities in terms of growth , employment figures , population and purchasing power and predicted how they would develop between 2002 and 2011 . the top 10 cities are all located in the western part of the country , and include cultural and financial centers such as cologne , frankfurt , wiesbaden and the former capital bonn .
berlin , which is struggling with high unemployment and declining investment , ranked only 32nd on the list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial ruhr region in germany 's northwest is declining in economic potential as heavy industry and mining shut down the industrial rhine-ruhr region , comprising cities such as dortmund , bochum and duisburg , showed the biggest decline in economic indicators compared to a 2002 ranking .
bochum fell nine places down to position 38 ; krefeld dropped down to 48 and essen – the biggest loser in the west – tumbled from 21 to 34 .
population decline and unemployment contributed significantly to the lower ranking . improvements in the east surprising was the number of eastern cities which made it into the top 60 .
compared to a similar ranking two years ago , four more cities made it onto the list .
the top among the eastern metropolises was dresden , which moved up from spot 34 to 14 .
leipzig improved the most , jumping from 43 to 19 .
jena climbed up 20 points to position 21 and potsdam surpassed neighboring berlin to end up in position 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwerin on the baltic sea might be a nice tourist destination , but it 's not attracting a lot of investment while the former east has its bright spots , particularly in the cities such as leipzig and dresden where high tech companies are beginning to invest , the region still has its downside .
the last five positions in the city ranking were all taken up by eastern cities : magdeburg , rostock , chemnitz , halle / saale and schwerin . the difference between the top and bottom of the list is particularly dramatic in terms of forecast for the next several years .
while the economic potential of munich increases by 25 percent , schwerin is only expected to grow by about 7 percent . cities beat out countryside overall , german cities proved to be the most dynamic in terms of boosting germany ’ s economy .
whereas urban areas are expected to produce an average growth rate of 18.9 percent , the rest of the country is only likely to turn out figures around 14 percent . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deconstructing germany due to a weak economy , falling birthrates and higher numbers of people relocating to find jobs , some german regions are losing population ; their cities are shrinking .

it is not a cure , but stops the virus from multiplying and is effective against strains that have become resistant to treatment . the new treatment , developed by scientists at the heinrich pette institute at the university of hamburg and the friedrich alexander university erlangen-nuremberg , takes a slightly different approach to traditional hiv therapies .
while conventional anti-retroviral treatments attempt to block the virus ' own proteins to keep it from replicating , this time researchers have focused on a human protein which the virus needs to make copies of itself .
the strategy targets a protein of a human host cell and blocks a human protein there called dhs , or deoxyhypusine synthase . " by indirectly targeting the virus we can also block viruses that are otherwise resistant against current therapies , " said ilona hauber , the lead scientist on the project . the development was announced and detailed in the current issue of the journal of clinical investigation , an american scientific magazine . numbers climbing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african aids activists almost 40 million people live with the hiv virus or aids and that number is increasing , especially in africa , parts of asian and eastern europe .

forklifts are constantly in use as deliveries for 9,000 health care stations in 126 countries are put together and packed for transport . basic right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 40 years that we 've been working as an organization , it 's always been important to us that health be a basic right , " said bernd pastors , the head of action medeor .
" but millions , even billions of people have no access to the most basic elements that make up proper health care .
our task is to work to improve that in cooperation with many other organizations . " action medeor 's story began in 1963 , in the garage of krefeld resident ernst boeker .
at first , the doctor planned to send clothing donations to the third world .
but then dr. boekers had another idea - he would collect doctors ' samples , especially medication , to give to missionary outposts in developing countries . it quickly became clear to boeker that the collected medication did n't always meet the needs of doctors working in africa , asia and latin america , and he was forced to re-think his concept . the breakthrough came when he decided to order the necessary medication from european manufacturers in bulk .
funded by donations , action medeor could then give medicine either for free or at cost to health care stations or other aid agencies .
the concept worked , allowing millions of people in developing countries to receive medication that meets european standards . tsunami challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers pack aid supplies for the tsunami victims forty years on , action medeor 's staff of around 50 is working non-stop to deliver aid to the countries in south asia that were hit by the tsunami disaster .
to work more effectively through this catastrophe , action medeor has joined forces with other aid organizations . on new year 's day , for example , action medeor put together " health kits " meant to supply 10,000 people with necessary items and medication for three months .
and a number of donation drives and tv benefit shows in germany are supposed to ensure that aid organizations are able to carry out their work in the crisis regions in the weeks and months to come . elena beier -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? germany -pipe- 04.01.2005 germany keen on south asia partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn has set up a partnership with the cuddalore district in india chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships . "
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .
20 . however , it remains to be seen whether schröder 's latest proposal of bilateral partnerships will find acceptance within the european union .
the chancellor is expected to float the idea during a meeting of eu development ministers on friday . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

it is not a cure , but stops the virus from multiplying and is effective against strains that have become resistant to treatment . the new treatment , developed by scientists at the heinrich pette institute at the university of hamburg and the friedrich alexander university erlangen-nuremberg , takes a slightly different approach to traditional hiv therapies .
while conventional anti-retroviral treatments attempt to block the virus ' own proteins to keep it from replicating , this time researchers have focused on a human protein which the virus needs to make copies of itself .
the strategy targets a protein of a human host cell and blocks a human protein there called dhs , or deoxyhypusine synthase . " by indirectly targeting the virus we can also block viruses that are otherwise resistant against current therapies , " said ilona hauber , the lead scientist on the project . the development was announced and detailed in the current issue of the journal of clinical investigation , an american scientific magazine . numbers climbing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african aids activists almost 40 million people live with the hiv virus or aids and that number is increasing , especially in africa , parts of asian and eastern europe .

it is not a cure , but stops the virus from multiplying and is effective against strains that have become resistant to treatment . the new treatment , developed by scientists at the heinrich pette institute at the university of hamburg and the friedrich alexander university erlangen-nuremberg , takes a slightly different approach to traditional hiv therapies .
while conventional anti-retroviral treatments attempt to block the virus ' own proteins to keep it from replicating , this time researchers have focused on a human protein which the virus needs to make copies of itself .
the strategy targets a protein of a human host cell and blocks a human protein there called dhs , or deoxyhypusine synthase . " by indirectly targeting the virus we can also block viruses that are otherwise resistant against current therapies , " said ilona hauber , the lead scientist on the project . the development was announced and detailed in the current issue of the journal of clinical investigation , an american scientific magazine . numbers climbing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african aids activists almost 40 million people live with the hiv virus or aids and that number is increasing , especially in africa , parts of asian and eastern europe .
even in the developed world , which has been confronted with the disease since the early 1980s , infection rates are rising , especially among young people .
although scientists are working on a vaccine , most say in the foreseeable future there will be no cure for those already infected .

get to know yanbei chen , a young chinese scientist who is one of this year ’ s recipients of a prize offered by the humboldt foundation . yanbei chen works at the albert einstein institute in golm , and is trying to prove the great physicist ’ s prediction on gravity waves .
he hopes to have some answers within the next 10 years .
gravity waves are one of the secrets that the universe does not reveal lightly .
they ’ re created when a large body of matter accelerates at tremendous speeds , for example when two black holes meet and meld .
ninety years ago , einstein predicted the occurrence of gravity waves during cataclysmic events like these .
until now , however , no scientists have been able to measure gravity waves directly , because on measuring instruments they only appear as incredibly small shifts in radiation .
the search for gravity waves has developed into an international competition .
in different parts of the world , research facilities have built new , kilometer-long measuring devices known as laser interferometers .
these are able measure deviations in radiation that are a thousand times shorter than an atomic nucleus is wide .
one of these huge detectors has been constructed by a german-british team in hanover , and is run by the experimental department of the nearby albert einstein institute .
yanbei chen ’ ’ s project is focused on optimizing detection techniques , and could help provide a basis for the next generation of gravity wave detectors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? germany -pipe- 04.01.2005 germany keen on south asia partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn has set up a partnership with the cuddalore district in india chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships . "
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .
20 . however , it remains to be seen whether schröder 's latest proposal of bilateral partnerships will find acceptance within the european union .

"
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .

26 , 2004 . the epicenter of the undersea quake which triggered massive tidal waves was near the northern tip of indonesia 's sumatra island .
the country 's aceh province , closest to the epicenter , has taken a severe battering with chaotic scenes of destruction and devastation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boeing-737 cargo plane carrying relief supplies lies on its side in the middle of the runway at banda aceh airport after it broke its wheels .
even as aid workers raced to supply food and water to the thousands of refugees on the island , the international relief effort suffered a setback on tuesday after the main airport in banda aceh , the island capital and a key hub for relief flights , was closed to planes .
the closure came after the landing gear of a cargo plane collapsed in the early hours of the morning . fact-finding team in the region despite the setback , the german army has received a go-ahead from the indonesian government to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the aceh province that would enable emergency medical aid and operations for the injured and sick . on saturday , an advance party of nine german soldiers , a so-called fact-finding team set off for aceh , to investigate conditions on the ground , assess the logistical challenges and check accessibility routes for flying in the mobile hospital unit which will be spread out in 40 tents . according to the german defense ministry , 120 german army paramedics will fly out to aceh , which has also been lashed by tropical rains in the aftermath of the disaster , and attend to victims in the field hospital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy 's hospital ship " the berlin " in addition , the german navy 's hospital ship , " berlin , " has also departed for indonesia as have members of the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- to set up a mobile water treatment plant to provide drinking water for sumatra 's civilian population . high-tech hospital the army hospital consists of 22 beds including three for intensive care patients .
this basic unit is meant above all to provide emergency medical aid to the population .
paramedics are expected to tour the region and provide first aid where needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a part of the mobile field hospital the more sophisticated elements of the field hospital include ultrasound machinery , x-rays and laboratory equipment which can help in diagnosing tropical illnesses as well as an on board pharmaceutical and medical supplies depot . jurdi ziad , who will head " mission aceh , " told german public broadcaster ndr that the mobile field hospital also enabled surgeons to perform emergency operations , up to 20 a day .
the entire maneuver will involve transporting around 350 tons of material , ziad said . the army paramedics will be flown out to aceh as soon as they get a green signal from the advance fact-finding team in the region .
the field hospital is expected to be up and running within two hours of reaching aceh and fully operational in 4 to 8 hours . utter chaos and destruction but , for now , it 's difficult for the group of around 120 german army paramedics who are still awaiting departure to aceh to paint a concrete picture of what awaits them in the crisis region . hartmut siebertz , vice commander of the unit said they were still waiting for assessment reports from the fact-finding team . " but , it 's still very likely that we can expect unimaginably horrible conditions and really difficult working conditions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless acehnese people wait aboard a ship in the port of banda aceh media reports and televised aerial images already speak of untold devastation in the remote parts of aceh province , where roads and airstrips have been washed away and entire towns have been erased from the map . this week , reporters spoke of scenes of utter chaos as thousands of refugees huddled in makeshift tents and the smell of putrefaction and the stench from the strewn debris wafted over the island .
aid workers are already warning of the onset of disease in the face of massive water contamination . fears and doubts some of the german army paramedics like stefanie schwenn from hamburg , admitted that she was nervous of the task ahead . " we were actually all on vacation when we got a call that we should travel back to the base because we were going to asia , " schwenn said .
" what can you say , you simply think , ' oh shit ' in that moment .
yes , it is my first deployment and it 's normal to be a bit scared . " schwenn said that all she knew about the devastation in aceh was what she had gleaned from the media . even sven börg , another paramedic who is preparing to leave for the region , said he expected it to be a harrowing experience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an acehnese man looks for relatives among victims of the earthquake in banda aceh " one ca n't really imagine it theoretically , " he said .
" i think , when we actually arrive it , it 's going to be quite a jolt for us to see how everything is destroyed . " despite the fears and doubts , siebertz said he believed that his mobile hospital unit could still provide valuable help to the remaining population . " in the face of the high death toll to say that our aid is just a ' small drop in the ocean ' sounds so negative , " he said .
" that 's not how i would assess it .
it 's a very high-quality help that we 're offering the people .

berlin , which is struggling with high unemployment and declining investment , ranked only 32nd on the list . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industrial ruhr region in germany 's northwest is declining in economic potential as heavy industry and mining shut down the industrial rhine-ruhr region , comprising cities such as dortmund , bochum and duisburg , showed the biggest decline in economic indicators compared to a 2002 ranking .
bochum fell nine places down to position 38 ; krefeld dropped down to 48 and essen – the biggest loser in the west – tumbled from 21 to 34 .
population decline and unemployment contributed significantly to the lower ranking . improvements in the east surprising was the number of eastern cities which made it into the top 60 .

but the south asia tsunami disaster has presented the german organization with a challenge unlike any in its history . when german airline ltu flew planes to the tsunami-affected countries to bring customers home , water purification tablets , mosquito nets , pain medication and antibiotics for 10,000 were also on board the aircraft . the staff at action medeor in krefeld knew which items to pull from the chock-full storage halls , and a new donation campaign was already up and running to finance further deliveries for 40 years , action medeor has dedicated itself to helping in emergency situations , as well as fighting malaria , tuberculosis and aids .
what began spontaneously as a private aid initiative collecting doctors ' medicine samples is today europe 's largest medical aid organization , complete with professional logistics , research , and production facilities on location in africa . on a tour through the storage rooms , the size of the challenge action medeor has taken on quickly becomes clear .
around 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,000 square feet -rrb- are piled high with huge pallets of medication , blankets , bandages and medical equipment .

at first , the doctor planned to send clothing donations to the third world .
but then dr. boekers had another idea - he would collect doctors ' samples , especially medication , to give to missionary outposts in developing countries . it quickly became clear to boeker that the collected medication did n't always meet the needs of doctors working in africa , asia and latin america , and he was forced to re-think his concept . the breakthrough came when he decided to order the necessary medication from european manufacturers in bulk .
funded by donations , action medeor could then give medicine either for free or at cost to health care stations or other aid agencies .

others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet . once upon a time , germans were accustomed to reading articles full of hope , enthusiasm and healthy earnings when they ’ d open the business pages of the newspaper .
but since 2001 , the financial sections have read more like the obituaries page .
the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .
only eight said they felt worse off ; the rest reported their mood was unchanged .
the majority said they planned on producing more in 2005 and would increase or at least maintain the level of 2004 investments in the coming year . “ the prospects for the german economy in 2005 are excellent , ” wrote chancellor gerhard schröder in an article in germany ’ s handelsblatt newspaper on thursday . schröder ’ s finance minister echoed the sentiment , telling the financial times : " 2004 was a good year , because the german economy finally moved out of stagnation . " the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .
several have actually lowered their growth forecasts for the coming year . “ we can ’ t expect a lot , ” said joachim scheide , who analyzes business cycles at the kiel institute .
“ unlike some others , we ’ re rather pessimistic . ”
driving factor : exports that pessimism has much to do with the decisive role exports play in the german economy .
much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .
that means demand for exports could sink , which could put a drag on german growth overall . euro , oil prices surge after a year in which the us dollar fell 5 percent against the euro , many are worried that a further climb will prove damaging to the german economy .
the european common currency peaked at $ 1.3667 in december and media outlets in 2004 were full of reports of companies suffering under a rising euro . many worried that the strong euro , along with record high oil prices last year , would nip that europe ’ s nascent recovery in the bud .
but oil prices have stabilized somewhat and european companies have not suffered as much as expected from the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the euro-dollar exchange rate stays around where it is , or even better , drops to around $ 1.30 in 2005 , german exporters should remain competitive enough to succeed in global markets , according to the chambers of commerce . “ we can ’ t ignore it , but we shouldn ’ t overrate it , ” said michael grömling , an analyst with the cologne institute of business research .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 04.01.2005 economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping it 'll keep rising after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .
others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet . once upon a time , germans were accustomed to reading articles full of hope , enthusiasm and healthy earnings when they ’ d open the business pages of the newspaper .
but since 2001 , the financial sections have read more like the obituaries page .
the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .
only eight said they felt worse off ; the rest reported their mood was unchanged .
the majority said they planned on producing more in 2005 and would increase or at least maintain the level of 2004 investments in the coming year . “ the prospects for the german economy in 2005 are excellent , ” wrote chancellor gerhard schröder in an article in germany ’ s handelsblatt newspaper on thursday . schröder ’ s finance minister echoed the sentiment , telling the financial times : " 2004 was a good year , because the german economy finally moved out of stagnation . " the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .
several have actually lowered their growth forecasts for the coming year . “ we can ’ t expect a lot , ” said joachim scheide , who analyzes business cycles at the kiel institute .
“ unlike some others , we ’ re rather pessimistic . ”
driving factor : exports that pessimism has much to do with the decisive role exports play in the german economy .
much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .
that means demand for exports could sink , which could put a drag on german growth overall . euro , oil prices surge after a year in which the us dollar fell 5 percent against the euro , many are worried that a further climb will prove damaging to the german economy .
the european common currency peaked at $ 1.3667 in december and media outlets in 2004 were full of reports of companies suffering under a rising euro . many worried that the strong euro , along with record high oil prices last year , would nip that europe ’ s nascent recovery in the bud .
but oil prices have stabilized somewhat and european companies have not suffered as much as expected from the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the euro-dollar exchange rate stays around where it is , or even better , drops to around $ 1.30 in 2005 , german exporters should remain competitive enough to succeed in global markets , according to the chambers of commerce . “ we can ’ t ignore it , but we shouldn ’ t overrate it , ” said michael grömling , an analyst with the cologne institute of business research .
“ the development was partially predictable and german companies have managed . ” go to page two to read how reforms to germany 's highly regulated labor market have given industry leaders a dose of good cheer . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moaning and groaning germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .
after three years of stagnation , the economy grew 1.8 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.01.2005 meeting the challenge of medical aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shipment of medical aid waits to be flown to sumatra europe 's largest medical aid organization , action medeor , has just marked 40 years in operation .
but the south asia tsunami disaster has presented the german organization with a challenge unlike any in its history . when german airline ltu flew planes to the tsunami-affected countries to bring customers home , water purification tablets , mosquito nets , pain medication and antibiotics for 10,000 were also on board the aircraft . the staff at action medeor in krefeld knew which items to pull from the chock-full storage halls , and a new donation campaign was already up and running to finance further deliveries for 40 years , action medeor has dedicated itself to helping in emergency situations , as well as fighting malaria , tuberculosis and aids .
what began spontaneously as a private aid initiative collecting doctors ' medicine samples is today europe 's largest medical aid organization , complete with professional logistics , research , and production facilities on location in africa . on a tour through the storage rooms , the size of the challenge action medeor has taken on quickly becomes clear .
around 4,000 square meters -lrb- 13,000 square feet -rrb- are piled high with huge pallets of medication , blankets , bandages and medical equipment .
forklifts are constantly in use as deliveries for 9,000 health care stations in 126 countries are put together and packed for transport . basic right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in the 40 years that we 've been working as an organization , it 's always been important to us that health be a basic right , " said bernd pastors , the head of action medeor .
" but millions , even billions of people have no access to the most basic elements that make up proper health care .
our task is to work to improve that in cooperation with many other organizations . " action medeor 's story began in 1963 , in the garage of krefeld resident ernst boeker .
at first , the doctor planned to send clothing donations to the third world .
but then dr. boekers had another idea - he would collect doctors ' samples , especially medication , to give to missionary outposts in developing countries . it quickly became clear to boeker that the collected medication did n't always meet the needs of doctors working in africa , asia and latin america , and he was forced to re-think his concept . the breakthrough came when he decided to order the necessary medication from european manufacturers in bulk .
funded by donations , action medeor could then give medicine either for free or at cost to health care stations or other aid agencies .
the concept worked , allowing millions of people in developing countries to receive medication that meets european standards . tsunami challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volunteers pack aid supplies for the tsunami victims forty years on , action medeor 's staff of around 50 is working non-stop to deliver aid to the countries in south asia that were hit by the tsunami disaster .
to work more effectively through this catastrophe , action medeor has joined forces with other aid organizations . on new year 's day , for example , action medeor put together " health kits " meant to supply 10,000 people with necessary items and medication for three months .
and a number of donation drives and tv benefit shows in germany are supposed to ensure that aid organizations are able to carry out their work in the crisis regions in the weeks and months to come . elena beier -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tsunami aid picks up as disease looms an unprecedented global aid operation gathered steam sunday to save survivors of asia 's tsunamis amid signs of disease after the disaster that claimed more than 127,000 lives .

"
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .
20 . however , it remains to be seen whether schröder 's latest proposal of bilateral partnerships will find acceptance within the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? germany -pipe- 04.01.2005 germany keen on south asia partnerships großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn has set up a partnership with the cuddalore district in india chancellor schröder wants to go beyond immediate financial and humanitarian aid to the tsunami-hit nations by proposing bilateral " partnerships . "
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .

it is not a cure , but stops the virus from multiplying and is effective against strains that have become resistant to treatment . the new treatment , developed by scientists at the heinrich pette institute at the university of hamburg and the friedrich alexander university erlangen-nuremberg , takes a slightly different approach to traditional hiv therapies .
while conventional anti-retroviral treatments attempt to block the virus ' own proteins to keep it from replicating , this time researchers have focused on a human protein which the virus needs to make copies of itself .
the strategy targets a protein of a human host cell and blocks a human protein there called dhs , or deoxyhypusine synthase .

it is not a cure , but stops the virus from multiplying and is effective against strains that have become resistant to treatment . the new treatment , developed by scientists at the heinrich pette institute at the university of hamburg and the friedrich alexander university erlangen-nuremberg , takes a slightly different approach to traditional hiv therapies .
while conventional anti-retroviral treatments attempt to block the virus ' own proteins to keep it from replicating , this time researchers have focused on a human protein which the virus needs to make copies of itself .
the strategy targets a protein of a human host cell and blocks a human protein there called dhs , or deoxyhypusine synthase . " by indirectly targeting the virus we can also block viruses that are otherwise resistant against current therapies , " said ilona hauber , the lead scientist on the project . the development was announced and detailed in the current issue of the journal of clinical investigation , an american scientific magazine . numbers climbing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african aids activists almost 40 million people live with the hiv virus or aids and that number is increasing , especially in africa , parts of asian and eastern europe .
even in the developed world , which has been confronted with the disease since the early 1980s , infection rates are rising , especially among young people .
although scientists are working on a vaccine , most say in the foreseeable future there will be no cure for those already infected .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 04.01.2005 economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping it 'll keep rising after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .
others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet . once upon a time , germans were accustomed to reading articles full of hope , enthusiasm and healthy earnings when they ’ d open the business pages of the newspaper .
but since 2001 , the financial sections have read more like the obituaries page .
the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .
only eight said they felt worse off ; the rest reported their mood was unchanged .
the majority said they planned on producing more in 2005 and would increase or at least maintain the level of 2004 investments in the coming year . “ the prospects for the german economy in 2005 are excellent , ” wrote chancellor gerhard schröder in an article in germany ’ s handelsblatt newspaper on thursday . schröder ’ s finance minister echoed the sentiment , telling the financial times : " 2004 was a good year , because the german economy finally moved out of stagnation . " the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .
several have actually lowered their growth forecasts for the coming year . “ we can ’ t expect a lot , ” said joachim scheide , who analyzes business cycles at the kiel institute .
“ unlike some others , we ’ re rather pessimistic . ”
driving factor : exports that pessimism has much to do with the decisive role exports play in the german economy .
much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .
that means demand for exports could sink , which could put a drag on german growth overall . euro , oil prices surge after a year in which the us dollar fell 5 percent against the euro , many are worried that a further climb will prove damaging to the german economy .
the european common currency peaked at $ 1.3667 in december and media outlets in 2004 were full of reports of companies suffering under a rising euro . many worried that the strong euro , along with record high oil prices last year , would nip that europe ’ s nascent recovery in the bud .
but oil prices have stabilized somewhat and european companies have not suffered as much as expected from the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the euro-dollar exchange rate stays around where it is , or even better , drops to around $ 1.30 in 2005 , german exporters should remain competitive enough to succeed in global markets , according to the chambers of commerce . “ we can ’ t ignore it , but we shouldn ’ t overrate it , ” said michael grömling , an analyst with the cologne institute of business research .
“ the development was partially predictable and german companies have managed . ” go to page two to read how reforms to germany 's highly regulated labor market have given industry leaders a dose of good cheer . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moaning and groaning germans should be pretty happy with the country 's economic performance in 2004 .

the world economy is growing faster than it has in 28 years , but the german economy is not part of it , complain economists at munich ’ s ifo economics institute and several leading banks . “ germany is disconnected from the world , ” said martin hüfner , chief economist at the hypovereinsbank in his new year ’ s commentary .
“ no other country in central or western europe has grown as slowly between 1995 and 2004 . ” while germany used to be called europe ’ s economic powerhouse , these days caboose is more like it . despite the improvements , some economists say the last-place position is not likely to change . joachim scheide from the kiel institute says for that to happen , berlin is going to have to institute far-reaching reforms and consider a more aggressive strategy for boosting growth .
“ we need the state to invest more and to really lower taxes so that the private sector has breathing room , ” he said .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 04.01.2005 economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's hoping it 'll keep rising after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .
others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet . once upon a time , germans were accustomed to reading articles full of hope , enthusiasm and healthy earnings when they ’ d open the business pages of the newspaper .
but since 2001 , the financial sections have read more like the obituaries page .
the number of business failures has skyrocketed , along with the unemployment figures .
stocks have generally headed in the opposite direction , along with business and consumer confidence . but analysts say 2004 marked a slight improvement in the german economy ’ s fortunes , or at least a leveling out of the freefall it had been in for three years .
now experts from several leading economics institutes are forecasting 2005 could bring the economy further out of the doldrums . “ german industry is in a good mood right now , ” said udo ludwig , economist at the halle institute for economic research .
“ stock market developments in 2004 were pretty good and as long as profit expectations stay healthy , the mood among companies shouldn ’ t get worse , probably a little better . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent survey of 43 economics associations carried out by the institute of the german economy in cologne found that 22 were feeling better now than they did a year ago .
only eight said they felt worse off ; the rest reported their mood was unchanged .
the majority said they planned on producing more in 2005 and would increase or at least maintain the level of 2004 investments in the coming year . “ the prospects for the german economy in 2005 are excellent , ” wrote chancellor gerhard schröder in an article in germany ’ s handelsblatt newspaper on thursday . schröder ’ s finance minister echoed the sentiment , telling the financial times : " 2004 was a good year , because the german economy finally moved out of stagnation . " the government has forecast the economy will grow at 1.7 percent in 2005 , a more optimistic outlook than that of most of the country ’ s leading economics think tanks .
several have actually lowered their growth forecasts for the coming year . “ we can ’ t expect a lot , ” said joachim scheide , who analyzes business cycles at the kiel institute .
“ unlike some others , we ’ re rather pessimistic . ”
driving factor : exports that pessimism has much to do with the decisive role exports play in the german economy .
much of the improvement in 2004 was due solely to exports , which roared ahead in the first half of the year , and there are hopes that that level can be maintained in 2005 . “ exports will continue as they have been for a while , and then the domestic situation will slowly pick up , ” said the halle institute ’ s ludwig . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others are n't so sure . the international monetary fund in washington has forecast global growth with slow to 4.3 percent next year from 5 percent in 2004 .
that means demand for exports could sink , which could put a drag on german growth overall . euro , oil prices surge after a year in which the us dollar fell 5 percent against the euro , many are worried that a further climb will prove damaging to the german economy .
the european common currency peaked at $ 1.3667 in december and media outlets in 2004 were full of reports of companies suffering under a rising euro . many worried that the strong euro , along with record high oil prices last year , would nip that europe ’ s nascent recovery in the bud .
but oil prices have stabilized somewhat and european companies have not suffered as much as expected from the strong euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the euro-dollar exchange rate stays around where it is , or even better , drops to around $ 1.30 in 2005 , german exporters should remain competitive enough to succeed in global markets , according to the chambers of commerce . “ we can ’ t ignore it , but we shouldn ’ t overrate it , ” said michael grömling , an analyst with the cologne institute of business research .

"
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes . " creating close bonds aberle also stressed that schröder 's proposal would create strong ties between nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman stares blankly from her makeshift tent in the middle of the road in banda aceh , the capital of aceh province " right now the pictures are there , emotions are running high and the people are helping .
but catastrophes - even ones as large as this one - run the risk of being forgotten , " she said .
" one simply has to think beyond today and think long-term . " bärbel diekmann , mayor of bonn , said that donations would be collected in bonn 's schools , kindergartens , companies and carnival festivities in the coming months .
" i can imagine every bonn school financing a house in cuddalore , " diekmann said .
" it 's very viable because it 's so concrete . " berlin , on the other hand , which has had a partnership with the indonesian capital of jakarta since 1994 , plans to continue aid efforts there despite the fact that the city was n't directly affected by the massive tidal waves .
but , given the huge death toll in indonesia alone - more than 94,000 confirmed dead - the german capital has decided to focus long-term help there . germany , largest donor ? germany has so far been at the forefront of international relief operations in the tsunami-affected regions , particularly in the worst-hit areas of indonesia and sri lanka . on tuesday , reports said schröder 's government , which has so far promised € 20 million -lrb- $ 27 million -rrb- in aid for the indian ocean nations devastated by the tsunami , would raise that amount by € 500 million more .
that would make it the single-largest donor .
the decision is expected to be approved and announced publicly at a special cabinet meeting on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army also plans to set up a mobile field hospital in the worst-affected indonesian province of aceh while the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- is setting up a water treatment plant to provide drinking water for the civilian population .
schröder has also called on rich nations to relieve debt of nations caught up in the tragedy and will propose such a moratorium for indonesia and somalia when the paris club of creditor nations next meets on jan .
20 . however , it remains to be seen whether schröder 's latest proposal of bilateral partnerships will find acceptance within the european union .

"
the idea of long-term help has found takers in germany . praised for his brisk and generous response to the tsunami disaster that hit asian countries , german chancellor gerhard schröder has now ramped up his government 's lasting commitment to international relief efforts by suggesting that help should continue long after the tragedy has disappeared from the headlines . in his annual new year 's address , schröder proposed that top industrial nations form bilateral " partnerships " with countries hit by the tsunami in southern asia on dec .
26 , 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder during his new year address " i envisage that all the big industrial countries each take responsibility for one nation .
also germany .
our states for corresponding areas there .
our cities for their cities and our villages for their villages , " schröder said in the speech . " german schools and children , supported by their parents , could sponsor schools over there , " the chancellor said .
" this would show that we want to go much further than pledging money - which is of course important - and that we understand our responsibility as long term . " " the right idea " schröder 's proposal has found a positive resonance in germany , where the disaster has struck a personal chord : at least 60 germans vacationing in southern asia have been confirmed dead , while over a 1,000 are still missing . most believe that schröder 's latest suggestion might be welcomed because personal donations , which have been pouring in from all corners of germany ever since the disaster struck , usually increase once people know how their money is being put to use .
in addition , forming city " partnerships " has the additional advantage that the help is n't a one-off gesture , but rather a long-term responsibility . kurt beck , premier of the state of rhineland-palatinate , called the suggestion " the only right idea to organize and structure support in the long term . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sri lankan girl negotiates wreckage at a refugee camp in pillai essen-based energy and chemical group rag has already agreed to sponsor 100 children in the crisis region and support them financially through school and vocational training until they are ready to fend for themselves . the proposal has also found takers among the german association of cities and municipalities .
franz-reinhard habbel , spokesman for the association , said that several municipalities in germany had already used their new year parties to collect donations and that the chancellor 's proposal meant that the funds could be used to establish partnerships with individual cities in the crisis regions and help repair damaged schools and streets . bonn and cuddalore the idea has also sparked interest among german cities .
the former capital of bonn already has - with the help of aid group " german agro action " - set up a partnership with the ravaged district of cuddalore tamil nadu , in southeast india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women grieve as they pass by boats destroyed by tidal waves at the harbor in nagappattinam , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu more than 7,400 people are feared dead in tamil nadu alone and the tsunami triggered by a powerful undersea earthquake hit cuddalore 's fishing community particularly hard , flattening the poorly-constructed huts and shacks on the beach . " we 're going to help exactly 1,992 families in the district of cuddalore , that 's about 12,000 people , more than 80 percent of whom are fishermen , " said marion aberle , spokeswoman for german agro action .
" we want to help them build a new life .
that means long-term help by providing boats , fishing nets , paddles as well as helping them reconstruct their homes .

get to know yanbei chen , a young chinese scientist who is one of this year ’ s recipients of a prize offered by the humboldt foundation . yanbei chen works at the albert einstein institute in golm , and is trying to prove the great physicist ’ s prediction on gravity waves .
he hopes to have some answers within the next 10 years .
gravity waves are one of the secrets that the universe does not reveal lightly .
they ’ re created when a large body of matter accelerates at tremendous speeds , for example when two black holes meet and meld .
ninety years ago , einstein predicted the occurrence of gravity waves during cataclysmic events like these .
until now , however , no scientists have been able to measure gravity waves directly , because on measuring instruments they only appear as incredibly small shifts in radiation .
the search for gravity waves has developed into an international competition .
in different parts of the world , research facilities have built new , kilometer-long measuring devices known as laser interferometers .
these are able measure deviations in radiation that are a thousand times shorter than an atomic nucleus is wide .
one of these huge detectors has been constructed by a german-british team in hanover , and is run by the experimental department of the nearby albert einstein institute .
yanbei chen ’ ’ s project is focused on optimizing detection techniques , and could help provide a basis for the next generation of gravity wave detectors .
the new laser interferometers would help illuminate the darkest parts of space , giving us a better understanding of the development of the universe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic einstein year news dw-world : the einstein tower dw-world : einstein spaces © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

cocaine is the drug of choice for london professionals my investigation into the drug scene in london , to be broadcast on tuesday , january 4 on bbc two , reveals a new breed of dealers who are running their empires like commercial businesses .
the distribution of cocaine in london seemed like any other service industry , dealing with customers like any other good delivery service .
click here to watch the programme the most remarkable enterprise did n't have a name but was known to insiders as ' dial-a-gram ' .
new customers needed referrals from existing clients and were then given a four digit code , similar to a pin number .
the head office was run by a man who was reckoned to earn £ 800,000 a year .
there were about a dozen ' delivery ' men , including ' montana ' .
customer focus drugland : london tuesday , 4 january , 2005 2100gmt bbc two drugland : london the failure of uk drug policy information and advice comment on the programme he said : " dial-a-gram delivers top quality product to the door eliminating the sleaze element of scoring in the back of a club and being able to have it delivered to your door in a courteous , customer focused kind of manner . "
montana 's clients are listed on dial-a-gram 's computer .
each evening , he is given a schedule with delivery addresses .
" there are some famous personalities , doctors , lawyers , city types .
there are also students - you can tell they 're in like shared houses and they club together for that little party pack . "
if the order is placed before 4pm , the £ 10 delivery charge is deducted .
cocaine usage has spread from the wealthy to all sections of society .
in the 1970s , it cost as much as £ 300 a gram at today 's prices .
now the same quantity can sell for £ 40 .
montana has a marketing degree but became a dealer when he ran into financial problems after losing his job .
he met an old mate for a drink and saw a rolex on his arm .
cocaine takeaway i 'm like pizza hut and dominoes - guaranteed delivery in 30 minutes ticketman , london drug dealer " i said where did you get that , taiwan for £ 15 ? "
montana 's friend replied that the watch was the genuine article .
he told the programme : " he said what he 'd been doing and i talked about my own situation and he said maybe there could be a mutual beneficial situation going down and within two days i was out doing the drops . "
there are various disguises employed by the delivery men to prevent drawing the attention of the police .
one man of asian origin had a chinese take-away in the front seat of his car with the cocaine hidden in the packaging .
another rode a moped and pretended he was doing the ' knowledge ' , the test that prospective cab drivers need to pass to display their understanding of london 's roads .
' montana ' used to claim to be real estate agent and followed three basic rules .
he said : " you never wear a baseball cap you never wear sunglasses and you never play music .
comfortable life cocaine now costs as little as £ 40 a gram " if the police pull you over they want to know what your hands are doing at all times .
you could have a shooter , you could be stashing stuff but they if they 've seen your hands at all times then they 're feeling comfortable .
you have to make them feel comfortable . "
the cocaine dealers who brought their product to the consumers seemed a far cry from the hollywood image of drug dealers , with gold chains , ak-47s and regular drive-by shootings of competitors .
the ' ticketman ' spent his early evening meticulously chopping up his weekly ounce of cocaine into packets weighing 0.8 gram .
that is the standard for dealers who claim to sell one gram wraps .
" i 'm like pizza hut and dominoes - guaranteed delivery in 30 minutes .
whatever hour it is i 'm awake , if i hear the phone ringing i 'll answer it .
i 'm a 24-hour pharmacy , " he said .
at 29 , he had been in the business for almost nine years , adding : " i 've had quite a comfortable life .
made a few mistakes , went to jail , but i 'm still here , surviving .
doing my thing , as they say .
but i 'm pretty bored . "
the ticketman is one of an estimated hundred thousand dealers up and down the country .
it 's a nightly routine that few know how to stop , so long as the demand for illegal drugs continues to grow .

the dyn -lrb- or man -rrb- project , funded by the cardiff community safety partnership , will provide a one-stop-shop for heterosexual , gay and bisexual men .
the project was developed from the work of the cardiff women 's safety unit .
uk government figures estimate that one in six men will experience domestic violence and the project aims to give victims confidential help .
the project will also try to identify the patterns of domestic abuse experienced by men , to improve the prospect of early intervention .
people in the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender communities experience domestic violence in a similar proportion to the rest of the population , about one in four .

"
" it is vital that you seek help if you are a victim of domestic violence , or become one .
" do not suffer in silence .
there are people who can help you to live in a safer environment that is free of violence " .
the dyn project is also being supported by south wales police , inspector jane mackay , from the force 's minorities support unit , said : ¿ victims of domestic violence from the gay community are frequently more vulnerable to the trauma of this abuse because of a general lack of specialist support and understanding in this area . "
domestic abuse blights the lives of thousands of people in wales - women and men derek walker , wales tuc the terrence higgins trust is another supporter , as is the tuc .
derek walker , head of policy and campaigns at the wales tuc , said the organisation welcomed this " badly-needed service " " domestic abuse blights the lives of thousands of people in wales - women and men , " he said .
" unfortunately , many will be reluctant to discuss the matter with others and as a result their experiences go unnoticed .
a promotional campaign is being conducted to help generate interest in the project , with posters and leaflets distributed in city centre shops .
refuge the dyn project will be open will be from 1000 to 1600 gmt from monday to wednesday , and 1500 to 2100 gmt on thursday .
the all wales domestic abuse helpline can refer male callers outside cardiff to a specific service for men .
an organisation which hopes to open the first refuge in wales for men suffering from domestic violence was launched in powys last february .
montgomeryshire family crisis centre say they have found a suitable property for the refuge and are now looking for funding .

as civil servants return to work in smoke-free buildings on tuesday , doctors applauded the ni civil service decision to ban smoking in government departments .
but they said that all employees should enjoy the same health rights .
they urged ni health minister angela smith to implement a smoking ban similar to that in the irish republic .
bma northern ireland council chairman dr brian patterson said that the government should not delay any longer .
" for each two weeks we put off this decision , we allow yet another person to die .
this is not acceptable and is morally wrong when it could easily be prevented , " he said .
" health minister angela smith has recognised that there is incontrovertible evidence that passive smoking kills but still continues to delay in putting an end to this situation .
we do not need further consultation .
the time for action is now . "
for a large proportion of the remainder of the workforce , there is still no respite from breathing in deadly tobacco smoke dr peter maguire bma dr patterson said there was a " groundswell " of public opinion that smoking should be banned .
dr peter maguire , deputy chairman of the bma 's board of science and an ardent campaigner for a ban on smoking in enclosed public places , said civil servants in northern ireland would now enjoy safer workplaces .
" this is great news for a section of northern ireland 's workforce , but for a large proportion of the remainder , there is still no respite from breathing in deadly tobacco smoke , " he said .
" these people are being forced to smoke tobacco through passive inhalation and only legislation will give them the opportunity to enjoy the same healthier environment that the minister for health will be enjoying now that 2005 has arrived . "
dr maguire said if the government had " the courage to take the same radical step as the government in the republic of ireland did " then employees could have the opportunity to work in a safe and healthy environment .
the smoking ban in all northern ireland government departments came into effect on 1 january .
the ban sees smoking facilities removed and staff forbidden to light up on site .
prisons are exempt from the ban .
since the end of march , smoking has been illegal in workplaces , including pubs and restaurants in the republic of ireland .
it was the first country in the world to introduce such a nationwide ban .
in 2004 , it was revealed northern ireland could be the pilot area for a smoking ban in workplaces across the uk .
it is believed discussions have already taken place between ministers at stormont and officials of the department of health in london .

police in the state of sabah say the rumours may have been spread by thieves hoping to loot deserted villages .
borneo may lie thousands of miles from the indian ocean shores devastated by last month 's tsunami , but local people evidently feel no safer knowing that .
rumours circulated that an island in the southern-most philippines had been inundated .
more than 10,000 people fled their homes around the town of semporna , on the east coast of sabah , while hundreds more left an area around lahad datu to the north and made for higher ground .
police had literally to coax thousands of the refugees down from the hills with assurances that it was safe to return .
after 36 hours , some have still not gone home .
the district police chief told the bbc that he was investigating the source of the rumours .
he said he thought they may have been started by criminals hoping to rob empty homes .
the report spread so fast that semporna , one of malaysia 's most remote towns , suffered a rare traffic jam , something that only normally happens during the annual boat festival .
some , however , were not so readily taken in by the panic .
one local district chieftain said his response to the rumours was to look at his cats and chickens .
they appeared not to be bothered , so neither was he .

analysts said the defence documents provided more details on wmc , and may trigger a possible rival bid .
" if a bid is going to emerge it is probably likely in the next one to two weeks , " said daiwa securities analyst mark pervan .
he said the valuation would put increased pressure on xstrata to look at " sweetening " its offer .
marc gonsalves , an executive at xstrata , said : " we will review the information contained in the target 's statement over the next week or so . "
he added : " while we will review the assumptions made by grant samuel in detail , we are extremely sceptical of their conclusion , and suggest that wmc shareholders take extreme care in presuming that these optimistic assumptions are capable of being realised . "
minerals valuation last month australia 's competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of wmc by zurich and london-based xstrata .
on tuesday , wmc chairman tommie bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders ' best interest to reject the offer .
he said wmc would pursue " value-creating options " provided by a portfolio of " world class assets " .
and wmc chief executive andrew michelmore claimed the xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for xstrata 's shareholders , and was not being made for the benefit of wmc 's shareholders .
grant samuel said its valuation of wmc was based on lower average prices for nickel , copper and uranium than current market levels .
" any longer term commodity price improvements would only improve our outlook , " mr michelmore said .
global operations in 2003 xstrata acquired australia 's largest copper miner - mim holdings .
wmc resources is the world 's third-largest producer of concentrated nickel , and also a miner of copper and uranium .
it owns the olympic dam mine in south australia , which contains about one-third of the world 's known uranium resources and is also the world 's fourth largest copper mine .
xstrata is a global mining giant with operations in australia , south africa , spain , germany , argentina and the uk .
its core products are copper , coking coal , thermal coal , ferrochrome , vanadium and zinc .
it also has growing businesses in gold , lead and silver .

tips from more than 100 influential uk music critics and broadcasters have been compiled into a list of artists to watch in the next 12 months .
we are revealing one artist from the top five every day until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be named .
when rapping about life and death in the notorious ' hood of compton , los angeles , it helps to know what you are talking about .
that makes the game , aka jayceon taylor , well qualified to document drug deals , gang violence , family break-ups and poverty in the area known as the home of gangsta rap . "
when i sold drugs , it was because it was my last resort ... when i picked up a gun , it was because my life was threatened " the game taylor , 24 , has been through a lot and , in the gangsta rap world where a hard life makes a good story , has drawn on his own experiences for his new album , the documentary .
he was moved to a foster home after " family problems " , dealt drugs , has had two brothers , a cousin and several friends killed in gang shootings and himself survived being shot five times in one night .
it was his own brush with death that made him look for an escape - and the world of rap , where the talented and lucky make millions and become superstars , was an appealing option .
taylor 's escape route came thanks to dr dre , rap legend and member of taylor 's idols nwa , whose straight outta compton album was a landmark in 1989 .
" i 'm not telling anybody to sell drugs or pick up guns , " taylor has said .
" when i sold drugs , it was because it was my last resort , because i had four sisters and an older brother and we were eating cheerios on thanksgiving .
" when i picked up a gun , it was because my life was threatened .
i 'm not glorifying the life i lived because i would n't wish that on anybody .
i 'm just one human being raised in the ' hood who wanted nothing more than to get out . "
the game got his name from his grandmother , who said he was game for anything when it came to sports .
he was a promising basketball player at school , but any notions of a career as a sportsman went out of the window when he was drawn into the gangs his brothers were involved in .
" i had a problem with authority growing up , " he said .
" i 'd get an a on the math test , then run outside and steal a car . "
when his brothers were killed , he got immersed in gang life and started dealing drugs .
it was as a dealer that he was shot in the chest , arms and leg in 2001 , leaving him in a coma .
while recovering , he turned to his hip-hop heroes and taught himself to rap , coming to the attention of dr dre the following year before being signed and groomed for the big time .
taylor said rather than making him want to get into the violent world they depicted , nwa actually made him realise he could make something of himself .
he has described both dre and former fellow nwa member eazy-e - who died in 1995 - as being " like the father i never had " and has a tattoo of eazy-e on his arm .
" we did n't even know our a-b-c but we knew n-w-a , " taylor said .
" to me , eazy-e was like robin hood , taking from the rich and giving to the poor . "
dr dre has now produced much of the documentary - while it also features the likes of 50 cent , kanye west and nate dogg .
with names like that behind him , taylor is set to become the latest gangsta made good .
the sound of 2005 survey was compiled from the tips of more than 100 impartial music critics and broadcasters , who were asked to give three names of artists they thought would be successful in 2005 .
the artists with the most tips were then ranked to compile the sound of 2005 list .

research published in the journal plos biology says the bird , haast 's eagle , was big enough to rule its environment .
the eagle increased its weight at a rate unprecedented in other birds and animals after reaching new zealand .
but it was driven to oblivion about five centuries ago , just 200 years or so after the first humans arrived .
the research is the work of scientists from the universities of oxford , uk , and canterbury , new zealand .
it was mainly funded by the uk 's natural environment research council -lrb- nerc -rrb- .
additional support came from the wellcome trust , the leverhulme trust and the foundation for research science and technology new zealand . "
the dna results were so radical that , at first , we questioned their authenticity " dr michael bunce the researchers , led by professor alan cooper from oxford 's ancient biomolecules centre , extracted dna from fossil eagle bones dating back about 2,000 years .
dr michael bunce , who carried out the research , said : " when we began the project it was to prove the relationship of the haast 's eagle with the large australian wedge-tailed eagle .
" but the dna results were so radical that , at first , we questioned their authenticity . "
what they showed was that the new zealand bird was in fact related to one of the world 's smallest eagles - the little eagle from australia and new guinea , which typically weighs less than 1kg -lrb- two pounds -rrb- .
yet the haast 's eagle weighed between 10kg -lrb- 1st 8lb -rrb- and 14kg -lrb- 2st 3lb -rrb- - between 30 % and 40 % heavier than the largest living bird of prey alive today , the harpy eagle of latin america , and was approaching the upper weight limit for powered flight .
dr bunce said : " even more striking was how closely related genetically the two species were .
we estimate that their common ancestor lived less than a million years ago .
" it means that an eagle arrived in new zealand and increased in weight by 10 to 15 times over this period , which is very fast in evolutionary terms .
such rapid size change is unprecedented in birds and animals . "
dr richard holdaway , a palaeobiologist at the university of canterbury , said : " the size of available prey and the absence of other predators are , we think , the key factors driving the size increase .
the eagles would have been able to feed unhindered on their kill . "
nerc says : " haast 's eagle is the only eagle known to have been the top predator in a major terrestrial ecosystem .
" they hunted moa , the herbivorous , flightless birds of new zealand -lsb- now also extinct -rsb- , which weighed up to 200kg -lrb- 31st 7lb -rrb- . "
the moa would be killed by a single strike to the head or neck from the eagle 's other claw " natural environment research council " with a truncated wingspan of around three metres , for flying under the forest canopy , the eagles struck their prey from the side , tearing into the pelvic flesh and gripping the bone with claws the size of a tiger 's paw .
" once caught , the moa would be killed by a single strike to the head or neck from the eagle 's other claw . "
the scientists believe the eagle died out within two centuries of human settlement of new zealand , which happened about 700 years ago .
forest fires destroyed its habitat and humans exterminated its food supply .
there is also some evidence to suggest the eagles were hunted .
before humans arrived , new zealand had virtually no terrestrial mammals apart from bats , the only inhabitants were about 250 species of bird .
there is no evidence the giant eagles ever attacked people .
other research in progress involves the dna from ancient moa droppings , and from soil in former petrel breeding colonies .

research published in the journal plos biology says the bird , haast 's eagle , was big enough to rule its environment .
the eagle increased its weight at a rate unprecedented in other birds and animals after reaching new zealand .
but it was driven to oblivion about five centuries ago , just 200 years or so after the first humans arrived .
the research is the work of scientists from the universities of oxford , uk , and canterbury , new zealand .
it was mainly funded by the uk 's natural environment research council -lrb- nerc -rrb- .
additional support came from the wellcome trust , the leverhulme trust and the foundation for research science and technology new zealand .
the dna results were so radical that , at first , we questioned their authenticity dr michael bunce the researchers , led by professor alan cooper from oxford 's ancient biomolecules centre , extracted dna from fossil eagle bones dating back about 2,000 years .
dr michael bunce , who carried out the research , said : " when we began the project it was to prove the relationship of the haast 's eagle with the large australian wedge-tailed eagle .
" but the dna results were so radical that , at first , we questioned their authenticity . "
what they showed was that the new zealand bird was in fact related to one of the world 's smallest eagles - the little eagle from australia and new guinea , which typically weighs less than 1kg -lrb- two pounds -rrb- .
yet the haast 's eagle weighed between 10kg -lrb- 1st 8lb -rrb- and 14kg -lrb- 2st 3lb -rrb- - between 30 % and 40 % heavier than the largest living bird of prey alive today , the harpy eagle of latin america , and was approaching the upper weight limit for powered flight .
the flightless moa is now extinct dr bunce said : " even more striking was how closely related genetically the two species were .
we estimate that their common ancestor lived less than a million years ago .
" it means that an eagle arrived in new zealand and increased in weight by 10 to 15 times over this period , which is very fast in evolutionary terms .
such rapid size change is unprecedented in birds and animals . "
dr richard holdaway , a palaeobiologist at the university of canterbury , said : " the size of available prey and the absence of other predators are , we think , the key factors driving the size increase .
the eagles would have been able to feed unhindered on their kill . "
nerc says : " haast 's eagle is the only eagle known to have been the top predator in a major terrestrial ecosystem .
" they hunted moa , the herbivorous , flightless birds of new zealand -lsb- now also extinct -rsb- , which weighed up to 200kg -lrb- 31st 7lb -rrb- .
the moa would be killed by a single strike to the head or neck from the eagle 's other claw natural environment research council " with a truncated wingspan of around three metres , for flying under the forest canopy , the eagles struck their prey from the side , tearing into the pelvic flesh and gripping the bone with claws the size of a tiger 's paw .
" once caught , the moa would be killed by a single strike to the head or neck from the eagle 's other claw . "
the scientists believe the eagle died out within two centuries of human settlement of new zealand , which happened about 700 years ago .
forest fires destroyed its habitat and humans exterminated its food supply .
there is also some evidence to suggest the eagles were hunted .
before humans arrived , new zealand had virtually no terrestrial mammals apart from bats , the only inhabitants were about 250 species of bird .
there is no evidence the giant eagles ever attacked people .
other research in progress involves the dna from ancient moa droppings , and from soil in former petrel breeding colonies .
