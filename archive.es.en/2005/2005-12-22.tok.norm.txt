it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

the eagle , with its huge beak and stumpy boot-clad feet , is already being referred to as " the drunken penguin " and is the subject of a name-the-bird competition in sport bild which could see the obviously challenged beast further burdened with a cutesy , cringy name . readers have four names to choose from : paule , knipsi , horst or butzi .
the lucky winners of the competition will be guests of honor at the friendly match in dortmund while the runners-up will win signed soccer shirts . while watching germany against the united states will be the main draw for most , there should be at least some interest as to how goleo and the eagle will get on . one thing in the eagle 's favor is that it 's not adverse to clothing below the waist .

the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

" i believe that germany can in future be governed in a simpler , more efficient and more transparent way , " she told the bundesrat . the reform initiative is seen as one of the most important projects of angela merkel ’ s grand coalition government .
a prior attempt about a year ago at disentangling federal and state responsibilities in german politics failed when a cross-party committee was unable to achieve a breakthrough because of a paralyzing balance of power between the two houses of parliament . new situation the situation is completely different now as christian and social democrats have entered a grand coalition at state level and can push things through with their huge majority in both the houses of parliament .
merkel said that the country could not afford to fail again . " i call on all sides concerned to decide on the federalism package with all the care required , but without any unnecessary delay , " said merkel .

and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game .

" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .

" i believe that germany can in future be governed in a simpler , more efficient and more transparent way , " she told the bundesrat . the reform initiative is seen as one of the most important projects of angela merkel ’ s grand coalition government .
a prior attempt about a year ago at disentangling federal and state responsibilities in german politics failed when a cross-party committee was unable to achieve a breakthrough because of a paralyzing balance of power between the two houses of parliament . new situation the situation is completely different now as christian and social democrats have entered a grand coalition at state level and can push things through with their huge majority in both the houses of parliament .
merkel said that the country could not afford to fail again . " i call on all sides concerned to decide on the federalism package with all the care required , but without any unnecessary delay , " said merkel .
" during my talks with state premiers last week , i sensed a strong resolve to complete the technical preparations for this reform before the summer break next year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat had become an obstacle the need for reform is obvious , say many .
at present , two thirds of all legislative bills have to be approved by both houses of parliament .
but while the social democrats were in power at state level and a majority of federal states were governed by the conservatives - more and more laws ended up in a cross-party arbitration committee .
and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game . " the message has to get through that there will be a greater division of labour and powers between the two houses of parliament , " he said .
" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .
the current grand coalition seems ideal for moving the federalism reform forward .
instead of party-political tactics , there will be a greater emphasis on what ’ s in the interest of the whole country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will be able to pass more bills most politicians say they do n't expect it all to be smooth sailing from now on .
the proposed first step in the federalism reform deliberately excludes thorny financial issues . still , both sides have agreed to work together to meet the financial criteria laid down in the european union ’ s stability and growth pact .
and , officials agree that given the current budget constraints , there is little room for fiscal manoeuvring . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast . " the seeds have been stuck in the system for a while , " said heinz degenhardt of pioneer hi-bred .
" the regular approval process could have actually been finished a long time ago , if it was not slowed down for political reasons .

" we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .

" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .
" there is still very much we do not know , and no one is looking for answers in a way would guarantee people 's health over the long term . " admitting that there is always a chance potential threat , seed producers insist that their products are as safe as others available on the market . " there is no technology that is completely risk free , " thierfelder said .
" but we think , and the approval authorities are also of the opinion , that the risk is justifiable .

12 , 1939 , it reads sixty years after the end of the nazi regime , cologne university organized a ceremonial act to rehabilitate the academics whose doctoral titles were revoked between 1933 and 1945 . they were jews , homosexuals , abortion doctors or regime opponents .
during the oppressive nazi regime in germany , they lost their academic titles , jobs , sources of income and their professional dignity . sixty years later , professor margit szöllösi-janze asked 25 students a chance to research the individual destinies of some 70 cologne university professors who were victims of nazi vilification , including jewish philosopher hans mazer , russian-born political scientist ossip k. flechtheim , and politician walter auerbach . the students examined more than 1,000 documents from the university archives . " i was looking for a topic that could be researched at our university archive and that our students would find interesting , " said szöllösi-janze . " i received assistance from our university archivist , who was very engaged and who drew our attention to these holdings . " tragic destinies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , rehabilitation of victims can only be symbolical over the course of one semester , the students explored the archive and encountered many interesting but also tragic and disconcerting stories .
two professors from cologne university died in concentration camps .
after 1945 , some of the academics tried to regain their titles , but without success .
the university never fully dealt with this topic until professor szöllösi-janze 's seminar . " it is surely an oversight that the topic is being picked up this late , " said axel freimuth , dean at cologne university . " now that the topic has emerged out of this research project , we have taken it upon ourselves to follow up the matter .
we on the administration side of things are willing to support such activities so that further research projects can be carried out , " said freimuth . symbolic apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eradication of ideas deemed dangerous was an essential mechanism of the nazi regime during the rehabilitation ceremony on monday night , freimuth said that the university admitted it was guilty , even as the injustice could not be rectified in retrospect . irene auerbach , daughter of the late politician walter auerbach , brought her father 's doctoral diploma to the university archive .
she came from the uk specifically for the occasion . " i honor the university that it is now trying to rectify this matter .
i think it was worth it , " said auerbach . " the fact that our citizenship was revoked had practical consequences .
my sister was stateless until she was almost 14 .
i was stateless until i was almost eight .
not having a passport could not to be ignored .
but my father kept using his doctoral title , " said auerbach . for the university , the formal ceremonial act is a gesture of atonement .
for the victims , all of whom have already passed away , the admission of guilt comes too late and is therefore only symbolic . similar acts of rehabilitation have taken place at other german universities , including those in tübingen , münster , marburg , göttingen and freiburg . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book claims stasi employed nazis as spies the former east germany 's feared stasi secret police set nazi officers to work as spies and protected them from prosecution , according to a new book that belies the official anti-fascist stance of the communist regime .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

" we must secure germany 's future as a place of innovation where outstanding scientists are forged , " schavan said in a newspaper interview on thursday . the huge financial boost was part of the 25-billion-euro investment program the governing christian democrats and social democrats agreed upon in their coalition deal , schavan said . the plans for the next four years will be finalized by mid-february and focus on life science , health , and nano- and automotive technologies , she added . the previous red-green government had agreed with states to spend 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.45 billion -rrb- over six years to improve the country 's academic institutions .
the federal government was to contribute 75 percent of the money . the plan represented a compromise between federal and state governments after the latter had opposed a federal push for 10 elite universities throughout the country . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on science take a look at this dossier to read about technological developments , research and scientific discoveries in germany .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

" first : in germany , managers who - with the approval of their company 's owners - receive special bonuses for their performance must fear criminal prosecution .
second : in germany , judges may decide what the true interests of private companies are .
third : the german state possesses an arsenal of legally flexible concepts with which it may intrude on everyday business operations .
the economically productive class is consigned to the arbitrariness of officials to the detriment of germany as a place of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , a swiss national , may soon be looking for a job outside germany " managers and high-level trade union representatives agree when it comes to taking advantage of their leadership positions , " wrote french business daily la tribu n e .
" that 's also what the german court ruling to open a new chapter in the mannesmann trial is about .
the highly controversial practice of the golden handshake is certainly not limited to german business circles .
the german court decision will also mark business practices outside germany .
beyond that it will hopefully have a moderating effect on pledges of millions of euros in bonuses for company leaders . " " with its ruling … the german federal court of justice further advanced nationalization and insecurity of german business , " criticized switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitu n g daily .
" the legal proceedings should be retried and judged again .
the possible developments are hardly as open as this sentence may sound .
the ruling indicates a creeping expansion of state influence . … in today 's germany rather it 's the state and the courts that define companies ' interests . " " a difficult burden would have arisen for germany as a business venue if the judges had tried to decide if the amounts of the bonuses were appropriate , " germany 's fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote .
" they wisely refrained from that . … during the retrial it should always be kept in mind that ackermann did n't make money out of it personally and that the subsequent owner of mannesmann , vodafone , did n't object to the bonus payments , although vodafone was ultimately the one to bear the financial consequences . … the decision makes at least one thing clear : it 's a warning sign for supervisory and management boards that are all too bonus-hungry and high-handed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.12.2005 european papers divided over mannesmann ruling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esser -lrb- photo -rrb- and ackermann will be back in the dock european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job . " now it 's for sure : when mannesmann 's supervisory board handed out millions in bonuses during the takeover by vodafone in spring 2000 , it committed breach of trust , " wrote germany 's süddeutsche zeitu n g daily .
" the german federal court of justice is convinced of that .
on wednesday the judge thus overruled the düsseldorf district court 's acquittal .
for the defendants , who in addition to former mannesmann boss klaus esser include current deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , it 's a bitter defeat .
for germany as a place of business , on the other hand , it 's a good decision .
in the long term , it will strengthen investors ' confidence in germany as a financial venue . "
" though possibly a sound legal ruling - but from a liberal point of view a deeply questionable one - that the federal court made in the mannesmann case , it illustrates three things , " berlin 's die welt newspaper commented .
" first : in germany , managers who - with the approval of their company 's owners - receive special bonuses for their performance must fear criminal prosecution .
second : in germany , judges may decide what the true interests of private companies are .
third : the german state possesses an arsenal of legally flexible concepts with which it may intrude on everyday business operations .
the economically productive class is consigned to the arbitrariness of officials to the detriment of germany as a place of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , a swiss national , may soon be looking for a job outside germany " managers and high-level trade union representatives agree when it comes to taking advantage of their leadership positions , " wrote french business daily la tribu n e .
" that 's also what the german court ruling to open a new chapter in the mannesmann trial is about .
the highly controversial practice of the golden handshake is certainly not limited to german business circles .
the german court decision will also mark business practices outside germany .
beyond that it will hopefully have a moderating effect on pledges of millions of euros in bonuses for company leaders . " " with its ruling … the german federal court of justice further advanced nationalization and insecurity of german business , " criticized switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitu n g daily .
" the legal proceedings should be retried and judged again .
the possible developments are hardly as open as this sentence may sound .
the ruling indicates a creeping expansion of state influence . … in today 's germany rather it 's the state and the courts that define companies ' interests . " " a difficult burden would have arisen for germany as a business venue if the judges had tried to decide if the amounts of the bonuses were appropriate , " germany 's fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote .
" they wisely refrained from that . … during the retrial it should always be kept in mind that ackermann did n't make money out of it personally and that the subsequent owner of mannesmann , vodafone , did n't object to the bonus payments , although vodafone was ultimately the one to bear the financial consequences . … the decision makes at least one thing clear : it 's a warning sign for supervisory and management boards that are all too bonus-hungry and high-handed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2005 germany starts sowing gm seeds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers expect gm crops to gain ground in germany in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .
now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast . " the seeds have been stuck in the system for a while , " said heinz degenhardt of pioneer hi-bred .
" the regular approval process could have actually been finished a long time ago , if it was not slowed down for political reasons . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first three types of gm corn were approved last week other gm crop changes also expected künast 's department blocked approval for the seeds - which produce bacteria to kill corn pests found in parts of germany while remaining safe for humans - on several occasions and encouraged organic farming methods instead . while new agriculture and consumer minister horst seehofer told the berliner zeitung , " we want to promote modified foods , " a ministry spokeswoman would only confirm that the policies were being examined . however , many in the gm industry expect a number of changes to be made under germany 's new grand coalition government , with the conservative christian social union 's seehofer at the head of the agriculture ministry . " we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .
current practice " discriminates against those who use genetic technology " and keeps them from using new techniques to increase their harvests by calling for an increase in organic farming , according to thierfelder . a question of coexistence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small particles make the coexistence of conventional and gm crops difficult " the conventional and genetically modified crop import market already shows that coexistence is possible in germany , " he added .
" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .
" there is still very much we do not know , and no one is looking for answers in a way would guarantee people 's health over the long term . " admitting that there is always a chance potential threat , seed producers insist that their products are as safe as others available on the market . " there is no technology that is completely risk free , " thierfelder said .
" but we think , and the approval authorities are also of the opinion , that the risk is justifiable . " more gm crops to come while both sides quote from studies about the danger or safety of gm crops , pioneer hi-bred 's degenhardt said he expects more of them to be officially approved for use in germany . " the german federal office of plant varieties approves between 15 and 20 types of corn each year for cultivation in germany , " pioneer 's degenhardt said .

" now it 's for sure : when mannesmann 's supervisory board handed out millions in bonuses during the takeover by vodafone in spring 2000 , it committed breach of trust , " wrote germany 's süddeutsche zeitu n g daily .
" the german federal court of justice is convinced of that .
on wednesday the judge thus overruled the düsseldorf district court 's acquittal .
for the defendants , who in addition to former mannesmann boss klaus esser include current deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , it 's a bitter defeat .
for germany as a place of business , on the other hand , it 's a good decision .
in the long term , it will strengthen investors ' confidence in germany as a financial venue . "
" though possibly a sound legal ruling - but from a liberal point of view a deeply questionable one - that the federal court made in the mannesmann case , it illustrates three things , " berlin 's die welt newspaper commented .
" first : in germany , managers who - with the approval of their company 's owners - receive special bonuses for their performance must fear criminal prosecution .
second : in germany , judges may decide what the true interests of private companies are .
third : the german state possesses an arsenal of legally flexible concepts with which it may intrude on everyday business operations .
the economically productive class is consigned to the arbitrariness of officials to the detriment of germany as a place of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , a swiss national , may soon be looking for a job outside germany " managers and high-level trade union representatives agree when it comes to taking advantage of their leadership positions , " wrote french business daily la tribu n e .
" that 's also what the german court ruling to open a new chapter in the mannesmann trial is about .
the highly controversial practice of the golden handshake is certainly not limited to german business circles .
the german court decision will also mark business practices outside germany .
beyond that it will hopefully have a moderating effect on pledges of millions of euros in bonuses for company leaders . " " with its ruling … the german federal court of justice further advanced nationalization and insecurity of german business , " criticized switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitu n g daily .
" the legal proceedings should be retried and judged again .
the possible developments are hardly as open as this sentence may sound .
the ruling indicates a creeping expansion of state influence . … in today 's germany rather it 's the state and the courts that define companies ' interests . " " a difficult burden would have arisen for germany as a business venue if the judges had tried to decide if the amounts of the bonuses were appropriate , " germany 's fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote .
" they wisely refrained from that . … during the retrial it should always be kept in mind that ackermann did n't make money out of it personally and that the subsequent owner of mannesmann , vodafone , did n't object to the bonus payments , although vodafone was ultimately the one to bear the financial consequences . … the decision makes at least one thing clear : it 's a warning sign for supervisory and management boards that are all too bonus-hungry and high-handed .

" i believe that germany can in future be governed in a simpler , more efficient and more transparent way , " she told the bundesrat . the reform initiative is seen as one of the most important projects of angela merkel ’ s grand coalition government .
a prior attempt about a year ago at disentangling federal and state responsibilities in german politics failed when a cross-party committee was unable to achieve a breakthrough because of a paralyzing balance of power between the two houses of parliament . new situation the situation is completely different now as christian and social democrats have entered a grand coalition at state level and can push things through with their huge majority in both the houses of parliament .
merkel said that the country could not afford to fail again . " i call on all sides concerned to decide on the federalism package with all the care required , but without any unnecessary delay , " said merkel .
" during my talks with state premiers last week , i sensed a strong resolve to complete the technical preparations for this reform before the summer break next year .

at present , two thirds of all legislative bills have to be approved by both houses of parliament .

and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game . " the message has to get through that there will be a greater division of labour and powers between the two houses of parliament , " he said .
" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .
the current grand coalition seems ideal for moving the federalism reform forward .

" i believe that germany can in future be governed in a simpler , more efficient and more transparent way , " she told the bundesrat . the reform initiative is seen as one of the most important projects of angela merkel ’ s grand coalition government .
a prior attempt about a year ago at disentangling federal and state responsibilities in german politics failed when a cross-party committee was unable to achieve a breakthrough because of a paralyzing balance of power between the two houses of parliament . new situation the situation is completely different now as christian and social democrats have entered a grand coalition at state level and can push things through with their huge majority in both the houses of parliament .
merkel said that the country could not afford to fail again . " i call on all sides concerned to decide on the federalism package with all the care required , but without any unnecessary delay , " said merkel .
" during my talks with state premiers last week , i sensed a strong resolve to complete the technical preparations for this reform before the summer break next year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat had become an obstacle the need for reform is obvious , say many .
at present , two thirds of all legislative bills have to be approved by both houses of parliament .
but while the social democrats were in power at state level and a majority of federal states were governed by the conservatives - more and more laws ended up in a cross-party arbitration committee .
and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game . " the message has to get through that there will be a greater division of labour and powers between the two houses of parliament , " he said .
" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .
the current grand coalition seems ideal for moving the federalism reform forward .
instead of party-political tactics , there will be a greater emphasis on what ’ s in the interest of the whole country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will be able to pass more bills most politicians say they do n't expect it all to be smooth sailing from now on .
the proposed first step in the federalism reform deliberately excludes thorny financial issues . still , both sides have agreed to work together to meet the financial criteria laid down in the european union ’ s stability and growth pact .
and , officials agree that given the current budget constraints , there is little room for fiscal manoeuvring . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast . " the seeds have been stuck in the system for a while , " said heinz degenhardt of pioneer hi-bred .
" the regular approval process could have actually been finished a long time ago , if it was not slowed down for political reasons . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first three types of gm corn were approved last week other gm crop changes also expected künast 's department blocked approval for the seeds - which produce bacteria to kill corn pests found in parts of germany while remaining safe for humans - on several occasions and encouraged organic farming methods instead . while new agriculture and consumer minister horst seehofer told the berliner zeitung , " we want to promote modified foods , " a ministry spokeswoman would only confirm that the policies were being examined . however , many in the gm industry expect a number of changes to be made under germany 's new grand coalition government , with the conservative christian social union 's seehofer at the head of the agriculture ministry . " we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .
current practice " discriminates against those who use genetic technology " and keeps them from using new techniques to increase their harvests by calling for an increase in organic farming , according to thierfelder . a question of coexistence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small particles make the coexistence of conventional and gm crops difficult " the conventional and genetically modified crop import market already shows that coexistence is possible in germany , " he added .
" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .
" there is still very much we do not know , and no one is looking for answers in a way would guarantee people 's health over the long term . " admitting that there is always a chance potential threat , seed producers insist that their products are as safe as others available on the market . " there is no technology that is completely risk free , " thierfelder said .

now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast . " the seeds have been stuck in the system for a while , " said heinz degenhardt of pioneer hi-bred .
" the regular approval process could have actually been finished a long time ago , if it was not slowed down for political reasons . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first three types of gm corn were approved last week other gm crop changes also expected künast 's department blocked approval for the seeds - which produce bacteria to kill corn pests found in parts of germany while remaining safe for humans - on several occasions and encouraged organic farming methods instead . while new agriculture and consumer minister horst seehofer told the berliner zeitung , " we want to promote modified foods , " a ministry spokeswoman would only confirm that the policies were being examined . however , many in the gm industry expect a number of changes to be made under germany 's new grand coalition government , with the conservative christian social union 's seehofer at the head of the agriculture ministry . " we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .
current practice " discriminates against those who use genetic technology " and keeps them from using new techniques to increase their harvests by calling for an increase in organic farming , according to thierfelder . a question of coexistence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small particles make the coexistence of conventional and gm crops difficult " the conventional and genetically modified crop import market already shows that coexistence is possible in germany , " he added .
" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price .

" i believe that germany can in future be governed in a simpler , more efficient and more transparent way , " she told the bundesrat . the reform initiative is seen as one of the most important projects of angela merkel ’ s grand coalition government .
a prior attempt about a year ago at disentangling federal and state responsibilities in german politics failed when a cross-party committee was unable to achieve a breakthrough because of a paralyzing balance of power between the two houses of parliament . new situation the situation is completely different now as christian and social democrats have entered a grand coalition at state level and can push things through with their huge majority in both the houses of parliament .
merkel said that the country could not afford to fail again . " i call on all sides concerned to decide on the federalism package with all the care required , but without any unnecessary delay , " said merkel .

and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game . " the message has to get through that there will be a greater division of labour and powers between the two houses of parliament , " he said .
" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .

at present , two thirds of all legislative bills have to be approved by both houses of parliament .
but while the social democrats were in power at state level and a majority of federal states were governed by the conservatives - more and more laws ended up in a cross-party arbitration committee .
and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game . " the message has to get through that there will be a greater division of labour and powers between the two houses of parliament , " he said .
" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .
the current grand coalition seems ideal for moving the federalism reform forward .
instead of party-political tactics , there will be a greater emphasis on what ’ s in the interest of the whole country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will be able to pass more bills most politicians say they do n't expect it all to be smooth sailing from now on .
the proposed first step in the federalism reform deliberately excludes thorny financial issues . still , both sides have agreed to work together to meet the financial criteria laid down in the european union ’ s stability and growth pact .
and , officials agree that given the current budget constraints , there is little room for fiscal manoeuvring . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

12 , 1939 , it reads sixty years after the end of the nazi regime , cologne university organized a ceremonial act to rehabilitate the academics whose doctoral titles were revoked between 1933 and 1945 . they were jews , homosexuals , abortion doctors or regime opponents .
during the oppressive nazi regime in germany , they lost their academic titles , jobs , sources of income and their professional dignity . sixty years later , professor margit szöllösi-janze asked 25 students a chance to research the individual destinies of some 70 cologne university professors who were victims of nazi vilification , including jewish philosopher hans mazer , russian-born political scientist ossip k. flechtheim , and politician walter auerbach . the students examined more than 1,000 documents from the university archives . " i was looking for a topic that could be researched at our university archive and that our students would find interesting , " said szöllösi-janze . " i received assistance from our university archivist , who was very engaged and who drew our attention to these holdings . " tragic destinies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , rehabilitation of victims can only be symbolical over the course of one semester , the students explored the archive and encountered many interesting but also tragic and disconcerting stories .
two professors from cologne university died in concentration camps .
after 1945 , some of the academics tried to regain their titles , but without success .
the university never fully dealt with this topic until professor szöllösi-janze 's seminar .

we on the administration side of things are willing to support such activities so that further research projects can be carried out , " said freimuth . symbolic apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eradication of ideas deemed dangerous was an essential mechanism of the nazi regime during the rehabilitation ceremony on monday night , freimuth said that the university admitted it was guilty , even as the injustice could not be rectified in retrospect . irene auerbach , daughter of the late politician walter auerbach , brought her father 's doctoral diploma to the university archive .
she came from the uk specifically for the occasion . " i honor the university that it is now trying to rectify this matter .

is there a conspiracy in germany to sabotage the world cup ?
anyone taking an interest in the official mascots may think so .
the latest , an eagle to front the national team , is already stirring embarrassment . just over six months to go before the world cup kicks off in germany and the competition is already white hot . while there will be no competitive games for the finalists between now and the first game on june 9 , there is another gripping competition taking place in germany right now .
it is being fought out by a number of nameless , faceless advertising and public relations experts who are engaged in a race to design the worst sporting mascot of all time . goleo a n d laughi n g logo deal the first blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trousers went that way soccer 's most prestigious event is already saddled with the embarrassment that is goleo iv , the exhibitionist , trouser-less lion - and his highly disturbing sidekick , the talking ball known as pille - while the 2006 world cup logo should hang its laughing heads in shame . but in an attempt not to be outdone by the official tournament mascots , the german national team has commissioned its own figurehead to lead the host nation into battle for the game 's greatest prize . the team 's mascot for the 2006 world cup will be a currently nameless , although " amusing , " eagle , according to german sports paper sport bild .
based on the german crest which adorns the national team 's shirts , the eagle is due to flap its way onto the international scene at its official unveiling before the germany-usa friendly in dortmund on march 22 . " dru n ke n pe n gui n " staggers i n to the race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paule , knipsi , horst or butzi ?
it wo n't make much difference its infamy is likely to have exceeded any possible anticipation by the time it lurches onto the pitch at the westfalenstadion next year .
the eagle , with its huge beak and stumpy boot-clad feet , is already being referred to as " the drunken penguin " and is the subject of a name-the-bird competition in sport bild which could see the obviously challenged beast further burdened with a cutesy , cringy name . readers have four names to choose from : paule , knipsi , horst or butzi .
the lucky winners of the competition will be guests of honor at the friendly match in dortmund while the runners-up will win signed soccer shirts . while watching germany against the united states will be the main draw for most , there should be at least some interest as to how goleo and the eagle will get on . one thing in the eagle 's favor is that it 's not adverse to clothing below the waist .
the battle to be the most embarrassing could well be a stalemate , but in a fight to the death the smart money is on the lion . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mascot for all seasons ?

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

" i believe that germany can in future be governed in a simpler , more efficient and more transparent way , " she told the bundesrat . the reform initiative is seen as one of the most important projects of angela merkel ’ s grand coalition government .
a prior attempt about a year ago at disentangling federal and state responsibilities in german politics failed when a cross-party committee was unable to achieve a breakthrough because of a paralyzing balance of power between the two houses of parliament . new situation the situation is completely different now as christian and social democrats have entered a grand coalition at state level and can push things through with their huge majority in both the houses of parliament .
merkel said that the country could not afford to fail again . " i call on all sides concerned to decide on the federalism package with all the care required , but without any unnecessary delay , " said merkel .
" during my talks with state premiers last week , i sensed a strong resolve to complete the technical preparations for this reform before the summer break next year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat had become an obstacle the need for reform is obvious , say many .
at present , two thirds of all legislative bills have to be approved by both houses of parliament .
but while the social democrats were in power at state level and a majority of federal states were governed by the conservatives - more and more laws ended up in a cross-party arbitration committee .
and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game . " the message has to get through that there will be a greater division of labour and powers between the two houses of parliament , " he said .
" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .
the current grand coalition seems ideal for moving the federalism reform forward .
instead of party-political tactics , there will be a greater emphasis on what ’ s in the interest of the whole country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will be able to pass more bills most politicians say they do n't expect it all to be smooth sailing from now on .
the proposed first step in the federalism reform deliberately excludes thorny financial issues . still , both sides have agreed to work together to meet the financial criteria laid down in the european union ’ s stability and growth pact .
and , officials agree that given the current budget constraints , there is little room for fiscal manoeuvring . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast . " the seeds have been stuck in the system for a while , " said heinz degenhardt of pioneer hi-bred .
" the regular approval process could have actually been finished a long time ago , if it was not slowed down for political reasons . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first three types of gm corn were approved last week other gm crop changes also expected künast 's department blocked approval for the seeds - which produce bacteria to kill corn pests found in parts of germany while remaining safe for humans - on several occasions and encouraged organic farming methods instead . while new agriculture and consumer minister horst seehofer told the berliner zeitung , " we want to promote modified foods , " a ministry spokeswoman would only confirm that the policies were being examined . however , many in the gm industry expect a number of changes to be made under germany 's new grand coalition government , with the conservative christian social union 's seehofer at the head of the agriculture ministry . " we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .
current practice " discriminates against those who use genetic technology " and keeps them from using new techniques to increase their harvests by calling for an increase in organic farming , according to thierfelder . a question of coexistence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small particles make the coexistence of conventional and gm crops difficult " the conventional and genetically modified crop import market already shows that coexistence is possible in germany , " he added .
" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .

12 , 1939 , it reads sixty years after the end of the nazi regime , cologne university organized a ceremonial act to rehabilitate the academics whose doctoral titles were revoked between 1933 and 1945 . they were jews , homosexuals , abortion doctors or regime opponents .
during the oppressive nazi regime in germany , they lost their academic titles , jobs , sources of income and their professional dignity . sixty years later , professor margit szöllösi-janze asked 25 students a chance to research the individual destinies of some 70 cologne university professors who were victims of nazi vilification , including jewish philosopher hans mazer , russian-born political scientist ossip k. flechtheim , and politician walter auerbach . the students examined more than 1,000 documents from the university archives . " i was looking for a topic that could be researched at our university archive and that our students would find interesting , " said szöllösi-janze . " i received assistance from our university archivist , who was very engaged and who drew our attention to these holdings . " tragic destinies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , rehabilitation of victims can only be symbolical over the course of one semester , the students explored the archive and encountered many interesting but also tragic and disconcerting stories .
two professors from cologne university died in concentration camps .
after 1945 , some of the academics tried to regain their titles , but without success .
the university never fully dealt with this topic until professor szöllösi-janze 's seminar . " it is surely an oversight that the topic is being picked up this late , " said axel freimuth , dean at cologne university . " now that the topic has emerged out of this research project , we have taken it upon ourselves to follow up the matter .
we on the administration side of things are willing to support such activities so that further research projects can be carried out , " said freimuth . symbolic apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eradication of ideas deemed dangerous was an essential mechanism of the nazi regime during the rehabilitation ceremony on monday night , freimuth said that the university admitted it was guilty , even as the injustice could not be rectified in retrospect . irene auerbach , daughter of the late politician walter auerbach , brought her father 's doctoral diploma to the university archive .
she came from the uk specifically for the occasion . " i honor the university that it is now trying to rectify this matter .
i think it was worth it , " said auerbach . " the fact that our citizenship was revoked had practical consequences .
my sister was stateless until she was almost 14 .
i was stateless until i was almost eight .
not having a passport could not to be ignored .
but my father kept using his doctoral title , " said auerbach . for the university , the formal ceremonial act is a gesture of atonement .
for the victims , all of whom have already passed away , the admission of guilt comes too late and is therefore only symbolic . similar acts of rehabilitation have taken place at other german universities , including those in tübingen , münster , marburg , göttingen and freiburg . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book claims stasi employed nazis as spies the former east germany 's feared stasi secret police set nazi officers to work as spies and protected them from prosecution , according to a new book that belies the official anti-fascist stance of the communist regime .

but , he insisted these were the only causes and added that he would be willing to head a similar un probe in the future . a recent spate of killings in lebanon prompted detlev mehlis to announce his belief that there was a connection between the latest attacks and the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister , rafiq hariri .
mehlis had been heading the un probe into the death of hariri , but announced last week he would be stepping down from the post . he was adamant however , that there was no mysterious motive for his decision .
" there is no hidden reason for my decision not to extend my contract again , there 's really no secret .
in addition , decisions made on a political level do n't affect the investigation . " when asked to cite reasons for his decision , the 56-year-old german lawyer denied suggestions that a hate campaign in the syrian media and personal threats to his safety had prompted him to leave the post .
rather it was the restrictive living conditions , he said . security measures infringed on personal life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security situation in lebanon makes normal life almost impossible " the security measures meant that i did n't have the opportunity to do anything , " he explained .
" i could n't just drive anywhere , have a beer or glass of wine or go for a meal .
i mean , in theory , i could , but it would have meant closing off areas , blocking streets , and getting 40 or 50 people to accompany me , and put themselves in danger .
that makes you think twice about going out . " mehlis told an arab newspaper that he was convinced of syria ’ s responsibility in the murder of rafiq hariri in february .
mehlis has spent seven months heading the un probe into the murder , which led to syria pulling forces out of lebanon , after 30 years of heavy military presence in the country . he has released two reports since october , heavily implicating syrian and lebanese intelligence officials in the murder .
syria has rejected the accusations . in addition to investigating hariri 's case , mehlis has also been looking into other murders he says are related to the case .
it 's been a distressing time , he said . hariri case just one of many harrowing investigations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a massive bomb attack killed hariri and at least nine other people " the hariri case was particularly sensitive , as he was a former prime minister who was killed in a certain political situation , " he said .
" but there were also 22 other victims , whose relatives and contacts i visited without the press .
that moved me as much as the hariri case . " mehlis has proposed that belgian serge brammertz , deputy prosecutor at the international criminal court in the hague , take over his position as head of the un probe .
the un investigation into hariri ’ s murder was extended last week , following a vote in the un security council . however , mehlis expects he may still have to return to lebanon during the coming months , to support whoever replaces him . jane conway -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investigator probes hariri murder a top german prosecutor appointed by the united nations to head an inquiry into the murder of lebanon 's former prime minister rafiq hariri has arrived in beirut to start his work .

now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast . " the seeds have been stuck in the system for a while , " said heinz degenhardt of pioneer hi-bred .
" the regular approval process could have actually been finished a long time ago , if it was not slowed down for political reasons . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first three types of gm corn were approved last week other gm crop changes also expected künast 's department blocked approval for the seeds - which produce bacteria to kill corn pests found in parts of germany while remaining safe for humans - on several occasions and encouraged organic farming methods instead . while new agriculture and consumer minister horst seehofer told the berliner zeitung , " we want to promote modified foods , " a ministry spokeswoman would only confirm that the policies were being examined . however , many in the gm industry expect a number of changes to be made under germany 's new grand coalition government , with the conservative christian social union 's seehofer at the head of the agriculture ministry . " we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .
current practice " discriminates against those who use genetic technology " and keeps them from using new techniques to increase their harvests by calling for an increase in organic farming , according to thierfelder . a question of coexistence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small particles make the coexistence of conventional and gm crops difficult " the conventional and genetically modified crop import market already shows that coexistence is possible in germany , " he added .
" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .
" there is still very much we do not know , and no one is looking for answers in a way would guarantee people 's health over the long term . " admitting that there is always a chance potential threat , seed producers insist that their products are as safe as others available on the market . " there is no technology that is completely risk free , " thierfelder said .
" but we think , and the approval authorities are also of the opinion , that the risk is justifiable .

" i believe that germany can in future be governed in a simpler , more efficient and more transparent way , " she told the bundesrat . the reform initiative is seen as one of the most important projects of angela merkel ’ s grand coalition government .
a prior attempt about a year ago at disentangling federal and state responsibilities in german politics failed when a cross-party committee was unable to achieve a breakthrough because of a paralyzing balance of power between the two houses of parliament . new situation the situation is completely different now as christian and social democrats have entered a grand coalition at state level and can push things through with their huge majority in both the houses of parliament .
merkel said that the country could not afford to fail again . " i call on all sides concerned to decide on the federalism package with all the care required , but without any unnecessary delay , " said merkel .
" during my talks with state premiers last week , i sensed a strong resolve to complete the technical preparations for this reform before the summer break next year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat had become an obstacle the need for reform is obvious , say many .
at present , two thirds of all legislative bills have to be approved by both houses of parliament .
but while the social democrats were in power at state level and a majority of federal states were governed by the conservatives - more and more laws ended up in a cross-party arbitration committee .
and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game . " the message has to get through that there will be a greater division of labour and powers between the two houses of parliament , " he said .
" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .
the current grand coalition seems ideal for moving the federalism reform forward .
instead of party-political tactics , there will be a greater emphasis on what ’ s in the interest of the whole country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will be able to pass more bills most politicians say they do n't expect it all to be smooth sailing from now on .
the proposed first step in the federalism reform deliberately excludes thorny financial issues . still , both sides have agreed to work together to meet the financial criteria laid down in the european union ’ s stability and growth pact .
and , officials agree that given the current budget constraints , there is little room for fiscal manoeuvring . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

" i believe that germany can in future be governed in a simpler , more efficient and more transparent way , " she told the bundesrat . the reform initiative is seen as one of the most important projects of angela merkel ’ s grand coalition government .
a prior attempt about a year ago at disentangling federal and state responsibilities in german politics failed when a cross-party committee was unable to achieve a breakthrough because of a paralyzing balance of power between the two houses of parliament . new situation the situation is completely different now as christian and social democrats have entered a grand coalition at state level and can push things through with their huge majority in both the houses of parliament .
merkel said that the country could not afford to fail again . " i call on all sides concerned to decide on the federalism package with all the care required , but without any unnecessary delay , " said merkel .
" during my talks with state premiers last week , i sensed a strong resolve to complete the technical preparations for this reform before the summer break next year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat had become an obstacle the need for reform is obvious , say many .
at present , two thirds of all legislative bills have to be approved by both houses of parliament .
but while the social democrats were in power at state level and a majority of federal states were governed by the conservatives - more and more laws ended up in a cross-party arbitration committee .
and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game . " the message has to get through that there will be a greater division of labour and powers between the two houses of parliament , " he said .
" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .
the current grand coalition seems ideal for moving the federalism reform forward .
instead of party-political tactics , there will be a greater emphasis on what ’ s in the interest of the whole country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will be able to pass more bills most politicians say they do n't expect it all to be smooth sailing from now on .
the proposed first step in the federalism reform deliberately excludes thorny financial issues . still , both sides have agreed to work together to meet the financial criteria laid down in the european union ’ s stability and growth pact .
and , officials agree that given the current budget constraints , there is little room for fiscal manoeuvring . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2005 germany starts sowing gm seeds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers expect gm crops to gain ground in germany in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .
now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast . " the seeds have been stuck in the system for a while , " said heinz degenhardt of pioneer hi-bred .
" the regular approval process could have actually been finished a long time ago , if it was not slowed down for political reasons . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first three types of gm corn were approved last week other gm crop changes also expected künast 's department blocked approval for the seeds - which produce bacteria to kill corn pests found in parts of germany while remaining safe for humans - on several occasions and encouraged organic farming methods instead . while new agriculture and consumer minister horst seehofer told the berliner zeitung , " we want to promote modified foods , " a ministry spokeswoman would only confirm that the policies were being examined . however , many in the gm industry expect a number of changes to be made under germany 's new grand coalition government , with the conservative christian social union 's seehofer at the head of the agriculture ministry . " we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .
current practice " discriminates against those who use genetic technology " and keeps them from using new techniques to increase their harvests by calling for an increase in organic farming , according to thierfelder . a question of coexistence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small particles make the coexistence of conventional and gm crops difficult " the conventional and genetically modified crop import market already shows that coexistence is possible in germany , " he added .
" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .
" there is still very much we do not know , and no one is looking for answers in a way would guarantee people 's health over the long term . " admitting that there is always a chance potential threat , seed producers insist that their products are as safe as others available on the market . " there is no technology that is completely risk free , " thierfelder said .
" but we think , and the approval authorities are also of the opinion , that the risk is justifiable . " more gm crops to come while both sides quote from studies about the danger or safety of gm crops , pioneer hi-bred 's degenhardt said he expects more of them to be officially approved for use in germany . " the german federal office of plant varieties approves between 15 and 20 types of corn each year for cultivation in germany , " pioneer 's degenhardt said .
" in the future there will also be approvals for genetically modified types , and that will become normal .

" now it 's for sure : when mannesmann 's supervisory board handed out millions in bonuses during the takeover by vodafone in spring 2000 , it committed breach of trust , " wrote germany 's süddeutsche zeitu n g daily .
" the german federal court of justice is convinced of that .
on wednesday the judge thus overruled the düsseldorf district court 's acquittal .
for the defendants , who in addition to former mannesmann boss klaus esser include current deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , it 's a bitter defeat .
for germany as a place of business , on the other hand , it 's a good decision .
in the long term , it will strengthen investors ' confidence in germany as a financial venue . "
" though possibly a sound legal ruling - but from a liberal point of view a deeply questionable one - that the federal court made in the mannesmann case , it illustrates three things , " berlin 's die welt newspaper commented .
" first : in germany , managers who - with the approval of their company 's owners - receive special bonuses for their performance must fear criminal prosecution .
second : in germany , judges may decide what the true interests of private companies are .
third : the german state possesses an arsenal of legally flexible concepts with which it may intrude on everyday business operations .
the economically productive class is consigned to the arbitrariness of officials to the detriment of germany as a place of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , a swiss national , may soon be looking for a job outside germany " managers and high-level trade union representatives agree when it comes to taking advantage of their leadership positions , " wrote french business daily la tribu n e .
" that 's also what the german court ruling to open a new chapter in the mannesmann trial is about .
the highly controversial practice of the golden handshake is certainly not limited to german business circles .
the german court decision will also mark business practices outside germany .
beyond that it will hopefully have a moderating effect on pledges of millions of euros in bonuses for company leaders . " " with its ruling … the german federal court of justice further advanced nationalization and insecurity of german business , " criticized switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitu n g daily .
" the legal proceedings should be retried and judged again .
the possible developments are hardly as open as this sentence may sound .
the ruling indicates a creeping expansion of state influence . … in today 's germany rather it 's the state and the courts that define companies ' interests . " " a difficult burden would have arisen for germany as a business venue if the judges had tried to decide if the amounts of the bonuses were appropriate , " germany 's fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote .
" they wisely refrained from that . … during the retrial it should always be kept in mind that ackermann did n't make money out of it personally and that the subsequent owner of mannesmann , vodafone , did n't object to the bonus payments , although vodafone was ultimately the one to bear the financial consequences . … the decision makes at least one thing clear : it 's a warning sign for supervisory and management boards that are all too bonus-hungry and high-handed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2005 german troops allegedly posed as journalists for interview großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ministry of defense is investigating the bundeswehr in bosnia the german ministry of defense has admitted that it is carrying out an internal inquiry into the possible extracting of information on suspected terrorists by bundeswehr operatives posing as journalists in bosnia . the confirmation of an inquiry on wednesday , reported in the german media on thursday , follows allegations that german soldiers attached to the united nations mission in bosnia had operated outside official army regulations and interviewed members of the public under a pretence . while stating that nothing concrete was known at this time , bernhard gertz , the chairperson of the german armed forces federation , told german television that it was the responsibility of the army to go everywhere and do everything it could in areas where it operates in a security role to unearth anything which could lead to " risks and dangers . " in july 2003 , anela kobilica , the wife of bensayah belkacem , a prisoner being held in guantanamo bay , received two mysterious visitors at her home in bosnia-herzegovina .
two men posing as german journalists arrived to ask questions about her husband , check personal documents and take photographs of her and her daughter .
however , the interview never appeared in any publication .
instead , the details of the visit turned up on the very same day in a german secret service report at a base in bosnia . secret service report i n cluded i n terview details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team accused of undertaking the interview usually compile info on operational areas the report was carried out by a group within the army which undertakes investigations into the surrounding areas of an armed forces operation .
the report contained detailed descriptions of kobilica 's living conditions , a table of contents showing the topics of conversation , detailed personal information , copies of documents , photos of herself and her four-year old child and letters she had received from her husband in guantanamo . kobilica had no suspicions that the men were not who they claimed to be , she told reporters investigating the bundeswehr allegations .
since her husband was arrested under suspicion of terrorist activities in october 2001 , she had been interviewed by a number of foreign journalists , including those from time magazine and the new york times .
each time , the interviews had centered on her husband 's incarceration . germa n " jour n alists " told of husba n d 's dete n tio n by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobilica 's husband was taken to guantanamo bay despite being acquitted by a bosnian court she told the germans the very same thing that she had told other reporters : that her husband had been arrested on suspicion of being a member of the so-called algerian six , a cell allegedly affiliated with al qaeda , but had been released after a campaign by amnesty international and a ruling from the highest court in bosnia which cited lack of evidence . but after his release , the men were taken by us authorities in january 2002 in disregard of the court 's judgment and spirited away to camp delta in guantanamo bay .
there the six men remain prisoners despite no charges being made publicly against them . " i explained everything to -lrb- the germans -rrb- , " kobilica said .
" these were the first german journalists whom i had spoken to . "
she had hoped that the germans would be especially objective in their reporting and would help publicize her husband 's case .
the behavior of the men had differed from the other reporters who had visited , she remembered . " they were too kind for journalists , too nice and too calm , " she said . no press id a n d n ame-checked papers de n y i n volveme n t and in further contrast to the others , they left no calling cards .
they only briefly showed kobilica an identity card baring a photo , and when she wanted to contact her lawyer to find out if it was okay to do the interview , they convinced her that it was not necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurter rundschau and the süddeutsche zeitung deny sending reporters to the interview kobilica remembers that during the four-hour conversation , the names of two german newspapers were dropped .

" in july 2003 , anela kobilica , the wife of bensayah belkacem , a prisoner being held in guantanamo bay , received two mysterious visitors at her home in bosnia-herzegovina .
two men posing as german journalists arrived to ask questions about her husband , check personal documents and take photographs of her and her daughter .

since her husband was arrested under suspicion of terrorist activities in october 2001 , she had been interviewed by a number of foreign journalists , including those from time magazine and the new york times .
each time , the interviews had centered on her husband 's incarceration . germa n " jour n alists " told of husba n d 's dete n tio n by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobilica 's husband was taken to guantanamo bay despite being acquitted by a bosnian court she told the germans the very same thing that she had told other reporters : that her husband had been arrested on suspicion of being a member of the so-called algerian six , a cell allegedly affiliated with al qaeda , but had been released after a campaign by amnesty international and a ruling from the highest court in bosnia which cited lack of evidence . but after his release , the men were taken by us authorities in january 2002 in disregard of the court 's judgment and spirited away to camp delta in guantanamo bay .
there the six men remain prisoners despite no charges being made publicly against them . " i explained everything to -lrb- the germans -rrb- , " kobilica said .

she had hoped that the germans would be especially objective in their reporting and would help publicize her husband 's case .

" in july 2003 , anela kobilica , the wife of bensayah belkacem , a prisoner being held in guantanamo bay , received two mysterious visitors at her home in bosnia-herzegovina .
two men posing as german journalists arrived to ask questions about her husband , check personal documents and take photographs of her and her daughter .
however , the interview never appeared in any publication .
instead , the details of the visit turned up on the very same day in a german secret service report at a base in bosnia . secret service report i n cluded i n terview details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team accused of undertaking the interview usually compile info on operational areas the report was carried out by a group within the army which undertakes investigations into the surrounding areas of an armed forces operation .
the report contained detailed descriptions of kobilica 's living conditions , a table of contents showing the topics of conversation , detailed personal information , copies of documents , photos of herself and her four-year old child and letters she had received from her husband in guantanamo . kobilica had no suspicions that the men were not who they claimed to be , she told reporters investigating the bundeswehr allegations .
since her husband was arrested under suspicion of terrorist activities in october 2001 , she had been interviewed by a number of foreign journalists , including those from time magazine and the new york times .
each time , the interviews had centered on her husband 's incarceration . germa n " jour n alists " told of husba n d 's dete n tio n by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobilica 's husband was taken to guantanamo bay despite being acquitted by a bosnian court she told the germans the very same thing that she had told other reporters : that her husband had been arrested on suspicion of being a member of the so-called algerian six , a cell allegedly affiliated with al qaeda , but had been released after a campaign by amnesty international and a ruling from the highest court in bosnia which cited lack of evidence . but after his release , the men were taken by us authorities in january 2002 in disregard of the court 's judgment and spirited away to camp delta in guantanamo bay .
there the six men remain prisoners despite no charges being made publicly against them . " i explained everything to -lrb- the germans -rrb- , " kobilica said .
" these were the first german journalists whom i had spoken to . "
she had hoped that the germans would be especially objective in their reporting and would help publicize her husband 's case .
the behavior of the men had differed from the other reporters who had visited , she remembered . " they were too kind for journalists , too nice and too calm , " she said . no press id a n d n ame-checked papers de n y i n volveme n t and in further contrast to the others , they left no calling cards .
they only briefly showed kobilica an identity card baring a photo , and when she wanted to contact her lawyer to find out if it was okay to do the interview , they convinced her that it was not necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurter rundschau and the süddeutsche zeitung deny sending reporters to the interview kobilica remembers that during the four-hour conversation , the names of two german newspapers were dropped .
yet the editorial staff at both the süddeutsche zeitu n g and the fra n kfurter ru n dschau had tasked none of their reporters with talking to her and knew nothing of the interview . when the story first began to come to light , the ministry of defense claimed the same thing .
but since a number of investigations and inquiries have been launched , the ministry has changed tack . saying that no position can be taken while internal investigations are on-going , a ministry spokesperson stated that while no concrete evidence has been unearthed yet , any soldiers carrying out such a procedure would have done so against official guidelines .
the spokesperson would not confirm or deny the existence of any other cases of the kind . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's intelligence service faces new allegations while investigations into alleged spying on german journalists continue , the federal intelligence service has now been accused of interrogating a german national in a syrian jail for torture .

the problems have been compounded by the fact that unemployment is almost double the level of that in the west and that thousands of young people are leaving . that is why leipzig was bursting with pride when it managed to attract the world cup : it is the only eastern city of the 12 chosen to host matches .

" in july 2003 , anela kobilica , the wife of bensayah belkacem , a prisoner being held in guantanamo bay , received two mysterious visitors at her home in bosnia-herzegovina .
two men posing as german journalists arrived to ask questions about her husband , check personal documents and take photographs of her and her daughter .
however , the interview never appeared in any publication .
instead , the details of the visit turned up on the very same day in a german secret service report at a base in bosnia . secret service report i n cluded i n terview details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team accused of undertaking the interview usually compile info on operational areas the report was carried out by a group within the army which undertakes investigations into the surrounding areas of an armed forces operation .
the report contained detailed descriptions of kobilica 's living conditions , a table of contents showing the topics of conversation , detailed personal information , copies of documents , photos of herself and her four-year old child and letters she had received from her husband in guantanamo . kobilica had no suspicions that the men were not who they claimed to be , she told reporters investigating the bundeswehr allegations .
since her husband was arrested under suspicion of terrorist activities in october 2001 , she had been interviewed by a number of foreign journalists , including those from time magazine and the new york times .
each time , the interviews had centered on her husband 's incarceration . germa n " jour n alists " told of husba n d 's dete n tio n by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobilica 's husband was taken to guantanamo bay despite being acquitted by a bosnian court she told the germans the very same thing that she had told other reporters : that her husband had been arrested on suspicion of being a member of the so-called algerian six , a cell allegedly affiliated with al qaeda , but had been released after a campaign by amnesty international and a ruling from the highest court in bosnia which cited lack of evidence . but after his release , the men were taken by us authorities in january 2002 in disregard of the court 's judgment and spirited away to camp delta in guantanamo bay .
there the six men remain prisoners despite no charges being made publicly against them . " i explained everything to -lrb- the germans -rrb- , " kobilica said .
" these were the first german journalists whom i had spoken to . "
she had hoped that the germans would be especially objective in their reporting and would help publicize her husband 's case .
the behavior of the men had differed from the other reporters who had visited , she remembered . " they were too kind for journalists , too nice and too calm , " she said . no press id a n d n ame-checked papers de n y i n volveme n t and in further contrast to the others , they left no calling cards .
they only briefly showed kobilica an identity card baring a photo , and when she wanted to contact her lawyer to find out if it was okay to do the interview , they convinced her that it was not necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurter rundschau and the süddeutsche zeitung deny sending reporters to the interview kobilica remembers that during the four-hour conversation , the names of two german newspapers were dropped .
yet the editorial staff at both the süddeutsche zeitu n g and the fra n kfurter ru n dschau had tasked none of their reporters with talking to her and knew nothing of the interview . when the story first began to come to light , the ministry of defense claimed the same thing .
but since a number of investigations and inquiries have been launched , the ministry has changed tack . saying that no position can be taken while internal investigations are on-going , a ministry spokesperson stated that while no concrete evidence has been unearthed yet , any soldiers carrying out such a procedure would have done so against official guidelines .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .

" we must secure germany 's future as a place of innovation where outstanding scientists are forged , " schavan said in a newspaper interview on thursday . the huge financial boost was part of the 25-billion-euro investment program the governing christian democrats and social democrats agreed upon in their coalition deal , schavan said . the plans for the next four years will be finalized by mid-february and focus on life science , health , and nano- and automotive technologies , she added . the previous red-green government had agreed with states to spend 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.45 billion -rrb- over six years to improve the country 's academic institutions .

" in july 2003 , anela kobilica , the wife of bensayah belkacem , a prisoner being held in guantanamo bay , received two mysterious visitors at her home in bosnia-herzegovina .
two men posing as german journalists arrived to ask questions about her husband , check personal documents and take photographs of her and her daughter .
however , the interview never appeared in any publication .
instead , the details of the visit turned up on the very same day in a german secret service report at a base in bosnia . secret service report i n cluded i n terview details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team accused of undertaking the interview usually compile info on operational areas the report was carried out by a group within the army which undertakes investigations into the surrounding areas of an armed forces operation .
the report contained detailed descriptions of kobilica 's living conditions , a table of contents showing the topics of conversation , detailed personal information , copies of documents , photos of herself and her four-year old child and letters she had received from her husband in guantanamo . kobilica had no suspicions that the men were not who they claimed to be , she told reporters investigating the bundeswehr allegations .
since her husband was arrested under suspicion of terrorist activities in october 2001 , she had been interviewed by a number of foreign journalists , including those from time magazine and the new york times .
each time , the interviews had centered on her husband 's incarceration . germa n " jour n alists " told of husba n d 's dete n tio n by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobilica 's husband was taken to guantanamo bay despite being acquitted by a bosnian court she told the germans the very same thing that she had told other reporters : that her husband had been arrested on suspicion of being a member of the so-called algerian six , a cell allegedly affiliated with al qaeda , but had been released after a campaign by amnesty international and a ruling from the highest court in bosnia which cited lack of evidence . but after his release , the men were taken by us authorities in january 2002 in disregard of the court 's judgment and spirited away to camp delta in guantanamo bay .
there the six men remain prisoners despite no charges being made publicly against them . " i explained everything to -lrb- the germans -rrb- , " kobilica said .
" these were the first german journalists whom i had spoken to . "
she had hoped that the germans would be especially objective in their reporting and would help publicize her husband 's case .
the behavior of the men had differed from the other reporters who had visited , she remembered . " they were too kind for journalists , too nice and too calm , " she said . no press id a n d n ame-checked papers de n y i n volveme n t and in further contrast to the others , they left no calling cards .
they only briefly showed kobilica an identity card baring a photo , and when she wanted to contact her lawyer to find out if it was okay to do the interview , they convinced her that it was not necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurter rundschau and the süddeutsche zeitung deny sending reporters to the interview kobilica remembers that during the four-hour conversation , the names of two german newspapers were dropped .
yet the editorial staff at both the süddeutsche zeitu n g and the fra n kfurter ru n dschau had tasked none of their reporters with talking to her and knew nothing of the interview . when the story first began to come to light , the ministry of defense claimed the same thing .
but since a number of investigations and inquiries have been launched , the ministry has changed tack . saying that no position can be taken while internal investigations are on-going , a ministry spokesperson stated that while no concrete evidence has been unearthed yet , any soldiers carrying out such a procedure would have done so against official guidelines .
the spokesperson would not confirm or deny the existence of any other cases of the kind . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's intelligence service faces new allegations while investigations into alleged spying on german journalists continue , the federal intelligence service has now been accused of interrogating a german national in a syrian jail for torture .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2005 german troops allegedly posed as journalists for interview großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german ministry of defense is investigating the bundeswehr in bosnia the german ministry of defense has admitted that it is carrying out an internal inquiry into the possible extracting of information on suspected terrorists by bundeswehr operatives posing as journalists in bosnia . the confirmation of an inquiry on wednesday , reported in the german media on thursday , follows allegations that german soldiers attached to the united nations mission in bosnia had operated outside official army regulations and interviewed members of the public under a pretence . while stating that nothing concrete was known at this time , bernhard gertz , the chairperson of the german armed forces federation , told german television that it was the responsibility of the army to go everywhere and do everything it could in areas where it operates in a security role to unearth anything which could lead to " risks and dangers . " in july 2003 , anela kobilica , the wife of bensayah belkacem , a prisoner being held in guantanamo bay , received two mysterious visitors at her home in bosnia-herzegovina .
two men posing as german journalists arrived to ask questions about her husband , check personal documents and take photographs of her and her daughter .
however , the interview never appeared in any publication .
instead , the details of the visit turned up on the very same day in a german secret service report at a base in bosnia . secret service report i n cluded i n terview details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team accused of undertaking the interview usually compile info on operational areas the report was carried out by a group within the army which undertakes investigations into the surrounding areas of an armed forces operation .
the report contained detailed descriptions of kobilica 's living conditions , a table of contents showing the topics of conversation , detailed personal information , copies of documents , photos of herself and her four-year old child and letters she had received from her husband in guantanamo . kobilica had no suspicions that the men were not who they claimed to be , she told reporters investigating the bundeswehr allegations .
since her husband was arrested under suspicion of terrorist activities in october 2001 , she had been interviewed by a number of foreign journalists , including those from time magazine and the new york times .
each time , the interviews had centered on her husband 's incarceration . germa n " jour n alists " told of husba n d 's dete n tio n by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobilica 's husband was taken to guantanamo bay despite being acquitted by a bosnian court she told the germans the very same thing that she had told other reporters : that her husband had been arrested on suspicion of being a member of the so-called algerian six , a cell allegedly affiliated with al qaeda , but had been released after a campaign by amnesty international and a ruling from the highest court in bosnia which cited lack of evidence . but after his release , the men were taken by us authorities in january 2002 in disregard of the court 's judgment and spirited away to camp delta in guantanamo bay .
there the six men remain prisoners despite no charges being made publicly against them . " i explained everything to -lrb- the germans -rrb- , " kobilica said .
" these were the first german journalists whom i had spoken to . "
she had hoped that the germans would be especially objective in their reporting and would help publicize her husband 's case .
the behavior of the men had differed from the other reporters who had visited , she remembered . " they were too kind for journalists , too nice and too calm , " she said . no press id a n d n ame-checked papers de n y i n volveme n t and in further contrast to the others , they left no calling cards .
they only briefly showed kobilica an identity card baring a photo , and when she wanted to contact her lawyer to find out if it was okay to do the interview , they convinced her that it was not necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurter rundschau and the süddeutsche zeitung deny sending reporters to the interview kobilica remembers that during the four-hour conversation , the names of two german newspapers were dropped .
yet the editorial staff at both the süddeutsche zeitu n g and the fra n kfurter ru n dschau had tasked none of their reporters with talking to her and knew nothing of the interview . when the story first began to come to light , the ministry of defense claimed the same thing .
but since a number of investigations and inquiries have been launched , the ministry has changed tack . saying that no position can be taken while internal investigations are on-going , a ministry spokesperson stated that while no concrete evidence has been unearthed yet , any soldiers carrying out such a procedure would have done so against official guidelines .
the spokesperson would not confirm or deny the existence of any other cases of the kind . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's intelligence service faces new allegations while investigations into alleged spying on german journalists continue , the federal intelligence service has now been accused of interrogating a german national in a syrian jail for torture .

" in july 2003 , anela kobilica , the wife of bensayah belkacem , a prisoner being held in guantanamo bay , received two mysterious visitors at her home in bosnia-herzegovina .
two men posing as german journalists arrived to ask questions about her husband , check personal documents and take photographs of her and her daughter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2005 germany starts sowing gm seeds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers expect gm crops to gain ground in germany in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .
now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast . " the seeds have been stuck in the system for a while , " said heinz degenhardt of pioneer hi-bred .
" the regular approval process could have actually been finished a long time ago , if it was not slowed down for political reasons . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first three types of gm corn were approved last week other gm crop changes also expected künast 's department blocked approval for the seeds - which produce bacteria to kill corn pests found in parts of germany while remaining safe for humans - on several occasions and encouraged organic farming methods instead . while new agriculture and consumer minister horst seehofer told the berliner zeitung , " we want to promote modified foods , " a ministry spokeswoman would only confirm that the policies were being examined . however , many in the gm industry expect a number of changes to be made under germany 's new grand coalition government , with the conservative christian social union 's seehofer at the head of the agriculture ministry . " we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .
current practice " discriminates against those who use genetic technology " and keeps them from using new techniques to increase their harvests by calling for an increase in organic farming , according to thierfelder . a question of coexistence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small particles make the coexistence of conventional and gm crops difficult " the conventional and genetically modified crop import market already shows that coexistence is possible in germany , " he added .
" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .
" there is still very much we do not know , and no one is looking for answers in a way would guarantee people 's health over the long term . " admitting that there is always a chance potential threat , seed producers insist that their products are as safe as others available on the market . " there is no technology that is completely risk free , " thierfelder said .
" but we think , and the approval authorities are also of the opinion , that the risk is justifiable . " more gm crops to come while both sides quote from studies about the danger or safety of gm crops , pioneer hi-bred 's degenhardt said he expects more of them to be officially approved for use in germany . " the german federal office of plant varieties approves between 15 and 20 types of corn each year for cultivation in germany , " pioneer 's degenhardt said .
" in the future there will also be approvals for genetically modified types , and that will become normal .

now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast . " the seeds have been stuck in the system for a while , " said heinz degenhardt of pioneer hi-bred .
" the regular approval process could have actually been finished a long time ago , if it was not slowed down for political reasons . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first three types of gm corn were approved last week other gm crop changes also expected künast 's department blocked approval for the seeds - which produce bacteria to kill corn pests found in parts of germany while remaining safe for humans - on several occasions and encouraged organic farming methods instead . while new agriculture and consumer minister horst seehofer told the berliner zeitung , " we want to promote modified foods , " a ministry spokeswoman would only confirm that the policies were being examined . however , many in the gm industry expect a number of changes to be made under germany 's new grand coalition government , with the conservative christian social union 's seehofer at the head of the agriculture ministry . " we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .
current practice " discriminates against those who use genetic technology " and keeps them from using new techniques to increase their harvests by calling for an increase in organic farming , according to thierfelder . a question of coexistence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small particles make the coexistence of conventional and gm crops difficult " the conventional and genetically modified crop import market already shows that coexistence is possible in germany , " he added .
" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .
" there is still very much we do not know , and no one is looking for answers in a way would guarantee people 's health over the long term . " admitting that there is always a chance potential threat , seed producers insist that their products are as safe as others available on the market . " there is no technology that is completely risk free , " thierfelder said .
" but we think , and the approval authorities are also of the opinion , that the risk is justifiable . " more gm crops to come while both sides quote from studies about the danger or safety of gm crops , pioneer hi-bred 's degenhardt said he expects more of them to be officially approved for use in germany . " the german federal office of plant varieties approves between 15 and 20 types of corn each year for cultivation in germany , " pioneer 's degenhardt said .
" in the future there will also be approvals for genetically modified types , and that will become normal .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .
the annual review can have its drama , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishermen have shown their displeasure at how few fish they are allowed to net french fishermen blockaded ports earlier this month over the prospect of more restrictions on how much fish they could net , while environment campaigners complained that the european union does not do more to enforce fishing limits . environmental advocates at greenpeace says the eu does little to prevent deep-sea fishing by vessels that don ’ t have fishing allocations - and needs to clamp down on illegal or ' pirate ' fishing . sam edmonds -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fish industry moves east an increasing number of german fishing companies are moving production to low wage countries .

the problems have been compounded by the fact that unemployment is almost double the level of that in the west and that thousands of young people are leaving . that is why leipzig was bursting with pride when it managed to attract the world cup : it is the only eastern city of the 12 chosen to host matches .
and it won the distinction of hosting the world cup draw dec .

" we wanted to show the rest of the world that the 2006 world cup is in a different country than in 1974 when west germany were hosts . " maybe so , but the word is n't getting out . bildunterschrift : leipzig built a stadium and won world cup matches potsdam might score world cup officials have been trying to ensure that the east gets some of the economic benefits of the matches by sending out some suggestions for bases in the east to participating teams .
but they acknowledge that the west has natural advantages : most of the matches are being held there and teams are more familiar with those areas . " most of the teams will land in frankfurt , so the natural inclination may be to look around there and the rhine area , " ulrich wolter , a world cup organizer in leipzig told reuters . still , a few teams are seriously considering potsdam , a suburb of berlin but in the eastern state of brandenburg .

is there a conspiracy in germany to sabotage the world cup ?
anyone taking an interest in the official mascots may think so .
the latest , an eagle to front the national team , is already stirring embarrassment . just over six months to go before the world cup kicks off in germany and the competition is already white hot . while there will be no competitive games for the finalists between now and the first game on june 9 , there is another gripping competition taking place in germany right now .
it is being fought out by a number of nameless , faceless advertising and public relations experts who are engaged in a race to design the worst sporting mascot of all time . goleo a n d laughi n g logo deal the first blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trousers went that way soccer 's most prestigious event is already saddled with the embarrassment that is goleo iv , the exhibitionist , trouser-less lion - and his highly disturbing sidekick , the talking ball known as pille - while the 2006 world cup logo should hang its laughing heads in shame . but in an attempt not to be outdone by the official tournament mascots , the german national team has commissioned its own figurehead to lead the host nation into battle for the game 's greatest prize . the team 's mascot for the 2006 world cup will be a currently nameless , although " amusing , " eagle , according to german sports paper sport bild .
based on the german crest which adorns the national team 's shirts , the eagle is due to flap its way onto the international scene at its official unveiling before the germany-usa friendly in dortmund on march 22 . " dru n ke n pe n gui n " staggers i n to the race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paule , knipsi , horst or butzi ?
it wo n't make much difference its infamy is likely to have exceeded any possible anticipation by the time it lurches onto the pitch at the westfalenstadion next year .
the eagle , with its huge beak and stumpy boot-clad feet , is already being referred to as " the drunken penguin " and is the subject of a name-the-bird competition in sport bild which could see the obviously challenged beast further burdened with a cutesy , cringy name . readers have four names to choose from : paule , knipsi , horst or butzi .
the lucky winners of the competition will be guests of honor at the friendly match in dortmund while the runners-up will win signed soccer shirts . while watching germany against the united states will be the main draw for most , there should be at least some interest as to how goleo and the eagle will get on . one thing in the eagle 's favor is that it 's not adverse to clothing below the waist .
the battle to be the most embarrassing could well be a stalemate , but in a fight to the death the smart money is on the lion . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mascot for all seasons ?

the latest , an eagle to front the national team , is already stirring embarrassment . just over six months to go before the world cup kicks off in germany and the competition is already white hot . while there will be no competitive games for the finalists between now and the first game on june 9 , there is another gripping competition taking place in germany right now .
it is being fought out by a number of nameless , faceless advertising and public relations experts who are engaged in a race to design the worst sporting mascot of all time . goleo a n d laughi n g logo deal the first blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trousers went that way soccer 's most prestigious event is already saddled with the embarrassment that is goleo iv , the exhibitionist , trouser-less lion - and his highly disturbing sidekick , the talking ball known as pille - while the 2006 world cup logo should hang its laughing heads in shame . but in an attempt not to be outdone by the official tournament mascots , the german national team has commissioned its own figurehead to lead the host nation into battle for the game 's greatest prize . the team 's mascot for the 2006 world cup will be a currently nameless , although " amusing , " eagle , according to german sports paper sport bild .
based on the german crest which adorns the national team 's shirts , the eagle is due to flap its way onto the international scene at its official unveiling before the germany-usa friendly in dortmund on march 22 .

the eagle , with its huge beak and stumpy boot-clad feet , is already being referred to as " the drunken penguin " and is the subject of a name-the-bird competition in sport bild which could see the obviously challenged beast further burdened with a cutesy , cringy name . readers have four names to choose from : paule , knipsi , horst or butzi .
the lucky winners of the competition will be guests of honor at the friendly match in dortmund while the runners-up will win signed soccer shirts . while watching germany against the united states will be the main draw for most , there should be at least some interest as to how goleo and the eagle will get on . one thing in the eagle 's favor is that it 's not adverse to clothing below the waist .

" it is in a deep crisis . " with a long line of members freezing their constitution ratification processes and no " plan b " , the bloc announced a " period of reflection " about where it should be going . successful budget talks the silver lining meanwhile , oblivious to public concern , the enlargement process lumbered on as british prime minister tony blair secured agreement to start membership talks with turkey and croatia , and finally give candidacy status to macedonia . by mid-december , eu leaders eventually resolved their future funding problems , settling old scores on britain 's rebate and france 's stance on farm subsidies , but only after some 30 hours of negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and blair managed to put aside their differences " for those of us who believe in europe , this is a good moment to take europe forward , " blair told the european parliament , noting that the deal includes a review of the way the eu collects and spends its money . " i hope that as a result of the deal that we secured ... we at least now offer the perspective in which the future of europe debate can be taken forward without it being continually dogged by an argument over the budget . " it could have been worse indeed , according to john palmer at the european policy centre think-tank in brussels , the year could have ended at lot worse . " a collapse of the budget talks might well have lent at least passing credibility to wild speculation about the slow break-up of the european union - perhaps starting with the disintegration of the euro area , " he said . while 2006 could hardly be worse - only one in two europeans felt that membership benefits their country in the year-end euro barometer poll - the next 12 months do look more promising . a new dawn ? new political horizons lie ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does angela merkel represent new hope for the bloc ?
elections are due in italy next year , blair and french president jacques chirac are due to go in the coming years , while german chancellor angela merkel - who has now vowed to pick the tattered constitution off the floor and breathe new life into it - has impressed her partners as an eu integrator . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .

" it is in a deep crisis . " with a long line of members freezing their constitution ratification processes and no " plan b " , the bloc announced a " period of reflection " about where it should be going . successful budget talks the silver lining meanwhile , oblivious to public concern , the enlargement process lumbered on as british prime minister tony blair secured agreement to start membership talks with turkey and croatia , and finally give candidacy status to macedonia . by mid-december , eu leaders eventually resolved their future funding problems , settling old scores on britain 's rebate and france 's stance on farm subsidies , but only after some 30 hours of negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and blair managed to put aside their differences " for those of us who believe in europe , this is a good moment to take europe forward , " blair told the european parliament , noting that the deal includes a review of the way the eu collects and spends its money . " i hope that as a result of the deal that we secured ... we at least now offer the perspective in which the future of europe debate can be taken forward without it being continually dogged by an argument over the budget . " it could have been worse indeed , according to john palmer at the european policy centre think-tank in brussels , the year could have ended at lot worse . " a collapse of the budget talks might well have lent at least passing credibility to wild speculation about the slow break-up of the european union - perhaps starting with the disintegration of the euro area , " he said . while 2006 could hardly be worse - only one in two europeans felt that membership benefits their country in the year-end euro barometer poll - the next 12 months do look more promising . a new dawn ? new political horizons lie ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does angela merkel represent new hope for the bloc ?
elections are due in italy next year , blair and french president jacques chirac are due to go in the coming years , while german chancellor angela merkel - who has now vowed to pick the tattered constitution off the floor and breathe new life into it - has impressed her partners as an eu integrator . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .

" now it 's for sure : when mannesmann 's supervisory board handed out millions in bonuses during the takeover by vodafone in spring 2000 , it committed breach of trust , " wrote germany 's süddeutsche zeitu n g daily .
" the german federal court of justice is convinced of that .
on wednesday the judge thus overruled the düsseldorf district court 's acquittal .
for the defendants , who in addition to former mannesmann boss klaus esser include current deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , it 's a bitter defeat .
for germany as a place of business , on the other hand , it 's a good decision .
in the long term , it will strengthen investors ' confidence in germany as a financial venue . "
" though possibly a sound legal ruling - but from a liberal point of view a deeply questionable one - that the federal court made in the mannesmann case , it illustrates three things , " berlin 's die welt newspaper commented .
" first : in germany , managers who - with the approval of their company 's owners - receive special bonuses for their performance must fear criminal prosecution .
second : in germany , judges may decide what the true interests of private companies are .
third : the german state possesses an arsenal of legally flexible concepts with which it may intrude on everyday business operations .
the economically productive class is consigned to the arbitrariness of officials to the detriment of germany as a place of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , a swiss national , may soon be looking for a job outside germany " managers and high-level trade union representatives agree when it comes to taking advantage of their leadership positions , " wrote french business daily la tribu n e .
" that 's also what the german court ruling to open a new chapter in the mannesmann trial is about .
the highly controversial practice of the golden handshake is certainly not limited to german business circles .
the german court decision will also mark business practices outside germany .
beyond that it will hopefully have a moderating effect on pledges of millions of euros in bonuses for company leaders . " " with its ruling … the german federal court of justice further advanced nationalization and insecurity of german business , " criticized switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitu n g daily .
" the legal proceedings should be retried and judged again .
the possible developments are hardly as open as this sentence may sound .
the ruling indicates a creeping expansion of state influence . … in today 's germany rather it 's the state and the courts that define companies ' interests . " " a difficult burden would have arisen for germany as a business venue if the judges had tried to decide if the amounts of the bonuses were appropriate , " germany 's fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote .
" they wisely refrained from that . … during the retrial it should always be kept in mind that ackermann did n't make money out of it personally and that the subsequent owner of mannesmann , vodafone , did n't object to the bonus payments , although vodafone was ultimately the one to bear the financial consequences . … the decision makes at least one thing clear : it 's a warning sign for supervisory and management boards that are all too bonus-hungry and high-handed .

" in july 2003 , anela kobilica , the wife of bensayah belkacem , a prisoner being held in guantanamo bay , received two mysterious visitors at her home in bosnia-herzegovina .
two men posing as german journalists arrived to ask questions about her husband , check personal documents and take photographs of her and her daughter .
however , the interview never appeared in any publication .
instead , the details of the visit turned up on the very same day in a german secret service report at a base in bosnia . secret service report i n cluded i n terview details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team accused of undertaking the interview usually compile info on operational areas the report was carried out by a group within the army which undertakes investigations into the surrounding areas of an armed forces operation .
the report contained detailed descriptions of kobilica 's living conditions , a table of contents showing the topics of conversation , detailed personal information , copies of documents , photos of herself and her four-year old child and letters she had received from her husband in guantanamo . kobilica had no suspicions that the men were not who they claimed to be , she told reporters investigating the bundeswehr allegations .
since her husband was arrested under suspicion of terrorist activities in october 2001 , she had been interviewed by a number of foreign journalists , including those from time magazine and the new york times .
each time , the interviews had centered on her husband 's incarceration . germa n " jour n alists " told of husba n d 's dete n tio n by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobilica 's husband was taken to guantanamo bay despite being acquitted by a bosnian court she told the germans the very same thing that she had told other reporters : that her husband had been arrested on suspicion of being a member of the so-called algerian six , a cell allegedly affiliated with al qaeda , but had been released after a campaign by amnesty international and a ruling from the highest court in bosnia which cited lack of evidence . but after his release , the men were taken by us authorities in january 2002 in disregard of the court 's judgment and spirited away to camp delta in guantanamo bay .
there the six men remain prisoners despite no charges being made publicly against them . " i explained everything to -lrb- the germans -rrb- , " kobilica said .
" these were the first german journalists whom i had spoken to . "
she had hoped that the germans would be especially objective in their reporting and would help publicize her husband 's case .
the behavior of the men had differed from the other reporters who had visited , she remembered . " they were too kind for journalists , too nice and too calm , " she said . no press id a n d n ame-checked papers de n y i n volveme n t and in further contrast to the others , they left no calling cards .
they only briefly showed kobilica an identity card baring a photo , and when she wanted to contact her lawyer to find out if it was okay to do the interview , they convinced her that it was not necessary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurter rundschau and the süddeutsche zeitung deny sending reporters to the interview kobilica remembers that during the four-hour conversation , the names of two german newspapers were dropped .
yet the editorial staff at both the süddeutsche zeitu n g and the fra n kfurter ru n dschau had tasked none of their reporters with talking to her and knew nothing of the interview . when the story first began to come to light , the ministry of defense claimed the same thing .
but since a number of investigations and inquiries have been launched , the ministry has changed tack . saying that no position can be taken while internal investigations are on-going , a ministry spokesperson stated that while no concrete evidence has been unearthed yet , any soldiers carrying out such a procedure would have done so against official guidelines .
the spokesperson would not confirm or deny the existence of any other cases of the kind . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's intelligence service faces new allegations while investigations into alleged spying on german journalists continue , the federal intelligence service has now been accused of interrogating a german national in a syrian jail for torture .

" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .

" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .

current practice " discriminates against those who use genetic technology " and keeps them from using new techniques to increase their harvests by calling for an increase in organic farming , according to thierfelder . a question of coexistence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small particles make the coexistence of conventional and gm crops difficult " the conventional and genetically modified crop import market already shows that coexistence is possible in germany , " he added .
" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .
" there is still very much we do not know , and no one is looking for answers in a way would guarantee people 's health over the long term . " admitting that there is always a chance potential threat , seed producers insist that their products are as safe as others available on the market . " there is no technology that is completely risk free , " thierfelder said .
" but we think , and the approval authorities are also of the opinion , that the risk is justifiable . " more gm crops to come while both sides quote from studies about the danger or safety of gm crops , pioneer hi-bred 's degenhardt said he expects more of them to be officially approved for use in germany . " the german federal office of plant varieties approves between 15 and 20 types of corn each year for cultivation in germany , " pioneer 's degenhardt said .
" in the future there will also be approvals for genetically modified types , and that will become normal .

" it is in a deep crisis . " with a long line of members freezing their constitution ratification processes and no " plan b " , the bloc announced a " period of reflection " about where it should be going . successful budget talks the silver lining meanwhile , oblivious to public concern , the enlargement process lumbered on as british prime minister tony blair secured agreement to start membership talks with turkey and croatia , and finally give candidacy status to macedonia . by mid-december , eu leaders eventually resolved their future funding problems , settling old scores on britain 's rebate and france 's stance on farm subsidies , but only after some 30 hours of negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and blair managed to put aside their differences " for those of us who believe in europe , this is a good moment to take europe forward , " blair told the european parliament , noting that the deal includes a review of the way the eu collects and spends its money . " i hope that as a result of the deal that we secured ... we at least now offer the perspective in which the future of europe debate can be taken forward without it being continually dogged by an argument over the budget . " it could have been worse indeed , according to john palmer at the european policy centre think-tank in brussels , the year could have ended at lot worse . " a collapse of the budget talks might well have lent at least passing credibility to wild speculation about the slow break-up of the european union - perhaps starting with the disintegration of the euro area , " he said . while 2006 could hardly be worse - only one in two europeans felt that membership benefits their country in the year-end euro barometer poll - the next 12 months do look more promising . a new dawn ? new political horizons lie ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does angela merkel represent new hope for the bloc ?
elections are due in italy next year , blair and french president jacques chirac are due to go in the coming years , while german chancellor angela merkel - who has now vowed to pick the tattered constitution off the floor and breathe new life into it - has impressed her partners as an eu integrator . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .

" with a long line of members freezing their constitution ratification processes and no " plan b " , the bloc announced a " period of reflection " about where it should be going . successful budget talks the silver lining meanwhile , oblivious to public concern , the enlargement process lumbered on as british prime minister tony blair secured agreement to start membership talks with turkey and croatia , and finally give candidacy status to macedonia . by mid-december , eu leaders eventually resolved their future funding problems , settling old scores on britain 's rebate and france 's stance on farm subsidies , but only after some 30 hours of negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and blair managed to put aside their differences " for those of us who believe in europe , this is a good moment to take europe forward , " blair told the european parliament , noting that the deal includes a review of the way the eu collects and spends its money . " i hope that as a result of the deal that we secured ... we at least now offer the perspective in which the future of europe debate can be taken forward without it being continually dogged by an argument over the budget . " it could have been worse indeed , according to john palmer at the european policy centre think-tank in brussels , the year could have ended at lot worse . " a collapse of the budget talks might well have lent at least passing credibility to wild speculation about the slow break-up of the european union - perhaps starting with the disintegration of the euro area , " he said . while 2006 could hardly be worse - only one in two europeans felt that membership benefits their country in the year-end euro barometer poll - the next 12 months do look more promising . a new dawn ? new political horizons lie ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does angela merkel represent new hope for the bloc ?
elections are due in italy next year , blair and french president jacques chirac are due to go in the coming years , while german chancellor angela merkel - who has now vowed to pick the tattered constitution off the floor and breathe new life into it - has impressed her partners as an eu integrator . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .

" in july 2003 , anela kobilica , the wife of bensayah belkacem , a prisoner being held in guantanamo bay , received two mysterious visitors at her home in bosnia-herzegovina .
two men posing as german journalists arrived to ask questions about her husband , check personal documents and take photographs of her and her daughter .
however , the interview never appeared in any publication .
instead , the details of the visit turned up on the very same day in a german secret service report at a base in bosnia . secret service report i n cluded i n terview details bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the team accused of undertaking the interview usually compile info on operational areas the report was carried out by a group within the army which undertakes investigations into the surrounding areas of an armed forces operation .

since her husband was arrested under suspicion of terrorist activities in october 2001 , she had been interviewed by a number of foreign journalists , including those from time magazine and the new york times .
each time , the interviews had centered on her husband 's incarceration . germa n " jour n alists " told of husba n d 's dete n tio n by us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobilica 's husband was taken to guantanamo bay despite being acquitted by a bosnian court she told the germans the very same thing that she had told other reporters : that her husband had been arrested on suspicion of being a member of the so-called algerian six , a cell allegedly affiliated with al qaeda , but had been released after a campaign by amnesty international and a ruling from the highest court in bosnia which cited lack of evidence . but after his release , the men were taken by us authorities in january 2002 in disregard of the court 's judgment and spirited away to camp delta in guantanamo bay .
there the six men remain prisoners despite no charges being made publicly against them . " i explained everything to -lrb- the germans -rrb- , " kobilica said .
" these were the first german journalists whom i had spoken to . "
she had hoped that the germans would be especially objective in their reporting and would help publicize her husband 's case .

" first : in germany , managers who - with the approval of their company 's owners - receive special bonuses for their performance must fear criminal prosecution .
second : in germany , judges may decide what the true interests of private companies are .

now , the first three types of gm corn have received approval . monsanto and pioneer hi-bred , which produce the three types of newly approved mon 810 seed for general use and sale by german farmers , hailed the decision as a break from the ideological agriculture policy propagated by former agriculture minister and green party member renate künast .

" we are naturally expecting other political changes , " monsanto 's andreas thierfelder said .
" we are hoping the new government does what it said it would do and change the genetic engineering law . " gm crop producers said they hope changes to the law will give gm products the same status as non-modified products .

" the cultivation of genetically modified crops puts greater demands on coexistence since it deals with relatively smaller particles , but coexistence is possible on farms . " but gm opponents do n't agree . peter röhrig of the ecological food industry federation , on the other hand , said there are a number of factors that prevent coexistence from being a practical solution , and that it is consumers opposed to gm products who pay the price . " right now the people who do not want to eat genetically modified food end up paying for the existence of genetically modified food by covering all the separation costs , " he said . some crops , like rapeseed , produce pollen that are able to fly far enough to make a non-gm harvest impossible , while even other gm crops , such as sugar beets , which do n't produce seeds in fields , require special transportation and handling , making it difficult and costly to meet stringent requirements placed on organic food , röhrig said . gm dangers incalculable touted by government and industry officials as an innovative industry for german farmers , gm food opponents also argue the dangers of gm crops have not been subject to enough scrutiny before being put on the open market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn is planted on some 300 hectares -lrb- 1,482 acres -rrb- in germany " there are short term studies done on mice and rabbits , but no long term studies with humans , " röhrig said , pointing out a recent case in australia where two individually safe pea genes were mixed and became toxic .

" now it 's for sure : when mannesmann 's supervisory board handed out millions in bonuses during the takeover by vodafone in spring 2000 , it committed breach of trust , " wrote germany 's süddeutsche zeitu n g daily .
" the german federal court of justice is convinced of that .
on wednesday the judge thus overruled the düsseldorf district court 's acquittal .
for the defendants , who in addition to former mannesmann boss klaus esser include current deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , it 's a bitter defeat .
for germany as a place of business , on the other hand , it 's a good decision .
in the long term , it will strengthen investors ' confidence in germany as a financial venue . "
" though possibly a sound legal ruling - but from a liberal point of view a deeply questionable one - that the federal court made in the mannesmann case , it illustrates three things , " berlin 's die welt newspaper commented .
" first : in germany , managers who - with the approval of their company 's owners - receive special bonuses for their performance must fear criminal prosecution .
second : in germany , judges may decide what the true interests of private companies are .
third : the german state possesses an arsenal of legally flexible concepts with which it may intrude on everyday business operations .
the economically productive class is consigned to the arbitrariness of officials to the detriment of germany as a place of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , a swiss national , may soon be looking for a job outside germany " managers and high-level trade union representatives agree when it comes to taking advantage of their leadership positions , " wrote french business daily la tribu n e .
" that 's also what the german court ruling to open a new chapter in the mannesmann trial is about .
the highly controversial practice of the golden handshake is certainly not limited to german business circles .
the german court decision will also mark business practices outside germany .
beyond that it will hopefully have a moderating effect on pledges of millions of euros in bonuses for company leaders . " " with its ruling … the german federal court of justice further advanced nationalization and insecurity of german business , " criticized switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitu n g daily .
" the legal proceedings should be retried and judged again .
the possible developments are hardly as open as this sentence may sound .
the ruling indicates a creeping expansion of state influence . … in today 's germany rather it 's the state and the courts that define companies ' interests . " " a difficult burden would have arisen for germany as a business venue if the judges had tried to decide if the amounts of the bonuses were appropriate , " germany 's fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote .
" they wisely refrained from that . … during the retrial it should always be kept in mind that ackermann did n't make money out of it personally and that the subsequent owner of mannesmann , vodafone , did n't object to the bonus payments , although vodafone was ultimately the one to bear the financial consequences . … the decision makes at least one thing clear : it 's a warning sign for supervisory and management boards that are all too bonus-hungry and high-handed .

" i believe that germany can in future be governed in a simpler , more efficient and more transparent way , " she told the bundesrat . the reform initiative is seen as one of the most important projects of angela merkel ’ s grand coalition government .
a prior attempt about a year ago at disentangling federal and state responsibilities in german politics failed when a cross-party committee was unable to achieve a breakthrough because of a paralyzing balance of power between the two houses of parliament . new situation the situation is completely different now as christian and social democrats have entered a grand coalition at state level and can push things through with their huge majority in both the houses of parliament .
merkel said that the country could not afford to fail again . " i call on all sides concerned to decide on the federalism package with all the care required , but without any unnecessary delay , " said merkel .
" during my talks with state premiers last week , i sensed a strong resolve to complete the technical preparations for this reform before the summer break next year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat had become an obstacle the need for reform is obvious , say many .
at present , two thirds of all legislative bills have to be approved by both houses of parliament .
but while the social democrats were in power at state level and a majority of federal states were governed by the conservatives - more and more laws ended up in a cross-party arbitration committee .
and there they were usually put on hold for long periods of time . the bundesrat thus took on an obstructive role which had not been envisaged by the founders of the german constitution .
the present coalition partners have now agreed that the lower house , the bundestag , will again be able to pass many more bills without approval by the bundesrat .
in return , the 16 federal states are to have more powers in several policy fields .
in future , they are to decide for themselves on educational policies , on the opening hours of shops , on civil servants ’ salaries and a whole catalogue of other issues . wo n't all be smooth sailing bundesrat president peter harry carstensen says he is looking forward to what he sees as a whole new ball game . " the message has to get through that there will be a greater division of labour and powers between the two houses of parliament , " he said .
" there ’ s no point in the two torpedoing each other ’ s decisions all the time , as we ’ ve seen in the past .
the current grand coalition seems ideal for moving the federalism reform forward .
instead of party-political tactics , there will be a greater emphasis on what ’ s in the interest of the whole country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundestag will be able to pass more bills most politicians say they do n't expect it all to be smooth sailing from now on .
the proposed first step in the federalism reform deliberately excludes thorny financial issues . still , both sides have agreed to work together to meet the financial criteria laid down in the european union ’ s stability and growth pact .
and , officials agree that given the current budget constraints , there is little room for fiscal manoeuvring . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges recovery and resolve in first speech angela merkel gave her first speech to parliament as german chancellor wednesday and spoke of a strong germany full of opportunities and a country that would stand firm on the issues of justice and equal rights .

it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news . the week before christmas is traditionally the week of the fish in brussels . each year fisheries ministers from around the european union meet to discuss quotas and other control measures , as they try balance economic and environmental concerns . marathon fishing talks have become somewhat of a pre-christmas tradition in brussels .
the ministers met on tuesday and worked for two days and two nights to reach a deal ahead of their target of dawn on thursday . at the end of discussions , the eu ministers struck a new deal over maximum 2006 catches .
the deal restricts the days trawlers can spend at sea in an attempt to prevent species like cod from collapsing following years of over-fishing . cod fishi n g days to be cut by five perce n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already subject to restrictions , cod trawlers will have even less time at sea under the compromise deal , the number of days cod trawlers can spend at sea will be cut by 5 percent - well short of the 15 percent recommended by the european commission . the outcome was also much milder than measures proposed by scientists , some of whom have been calling for a blanket ban on cod fishing because of dwindling stocks . cod quotas remain one of the most sensitive topics for communities along the north sea , especially in scotland , where white-fish fleets are already obliged to tie up their boats for weeks on end . the european commission , which administers the eu 's fishing policy , did manage to secure a few seasonal closures of certain waters to protect over-fished cod species .
but pressure from various fishing lobbies forced to the commission to offer some slight increases in its initial catch proposals . praw n s n ot so lucky as quotas raised bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas on other types of fish are being raised prawn quotas were raised for the north sea and bay of biscay by up to 30 percent from 2005 , for example , based on scientific advice that these fish stocks could support increased fishing . eu fisheries commissioner joe borg said the deal struck the " right balance " in terms of protecting the environment without unduly penalizing fishing fleets .
all 25 eu nations taking part in the talks voted in favor of the deal , except sweden , which abstained . a n chovies fair game as eu lifts ba n french officials expressed particular pleasure at achieving of lifting a ban on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay , in place since july .
french fleets were granted a quota of 500 tons , with 500 more tons gained thanks to a quota swap with spain . but not all the action is restricted to the negotiating table .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.12.2005 european papers divided over mannesmann ruling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esser -lrb- photo -rrb- and ackermann will be back in the dock european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job . " now it 's for sure : when mannesmann 's supervisory board handed out millions in bonuses during the takeover by vodafone in spring 2000 , it committed breach of trust , " wrote germany 's süddeutsche zeitu n g daily .
" the german federal court of justice is convinced of that .
on wednesday the judge thus overruled the düsseldorf district court 's acquittal .
for the defendants , who in addition to former mannesmann boss klaus esser include current deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , it 's a bitter defeat .
for germany as a place of business , on the other hand , it 's a good decision .
in the long term , it will strengthen investors ' confidence in germany as a financial venue . "
" though possibly a sound legal ruling - but from a liberal point of view a deeply questionable one - that the federal court made in the mannesmann case , it illustrates three things , " berlin 's die welt newspaper commented .
" first : in germany , managers who - with the approval of their company 's owners - receive special bonuses for their performance must fear criminal prosecution .
second : in germany , judges may decide what the true interests of private companies are .
third : the german state possesses an arsenal of legally flexible concepts with which it may intrude on everyday business operations .
the economically productive class is consigned to the arbitrariness of officials to the detriment of germany as a place of business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , a swiss national , may soon be looking for a job outside germany " managers and high-level trade union representatives agree when it comes to taking advantage of their leadership positions , " wrote french business daily la tribu n e .
" that 's also what the german court ruling to open a new chapter in the mannesmann trial is about .
the highly controversial practice of the golden handshake is certainly not limited to german business circles .
the german court decision will also mark business practices outside germany .
beyond that it will hopefully have a moderating effect on pledges of millions of euros in bonuses for company leaders . " " with its ruling … the german federal court of justice further advanced nationalization and insecurity of german business , " criticized switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitu n g daily .
" the legal proceedings should be retried and judged again .
the possible developments are hardly as open as this sentence may sound .
the ruling indicates a creeping expansion of state influence . … in today 's germany rather it 's the state and the courts that define companies ' interests . " " a difficult burden would have arisen for germany as a business venue if the judges had tried to decide if the amounts of the bonuses were appropriate , " germany 's fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g wrote .
" they wisely refrained from that . … during the retrial it should always be kept in mind that ackermann did n't make money out of it personally and that the subsequent owner of mannesmann , vodafone , did n't object to the bonus payments , although vodafone was ultimately the one to bear the financial consequences . … the decision makes at least one thing clear : it 's a warning sign for supervisory and management boards that are all too bonus-hungry and high-handed .

alejandro toledo declared a two-month state of emergency in six central peruvian provinces thought to be under the sway of drug traffickers .
the emergency measures allow troops to deploy in the area , raid homes and break up public meetings .
remnants of peru 's leftist shining path guerrillas were blamed for tuesday 's attack in huanuco province .
announcing the emergency measures at a police barracks in peru 's capital , lima , mr toledo blamed the violence on the escalating drugs trade in the coca-producing regions .
" they will pay , " mr toledo said of the rebel groups .
" my government is prepared to provide everything that our police and our armed forces need professionally .
" the eight officers fell at the cowardly hands of terrorists who today are in the service of drug trafficking . "
last rebels the ambush was the latest incident in an upsurge of violence linked to recent efforts to destroy coca crops .
renegade shining path units are thought to be behind a series of attacks against security forces , despite the group 's general defeat in the 1990s .
the shining path began a guerrilla campaign to topple the peruvian state in the 1980s .
the group is blamed for about half the 69,000 deaths occurred during two decades of civil conflict .
the group 's leader , abimael guzman , was arrested in 1992 in a high-profile operation .
he is currently being retried for his role in the insurgency after a secret military conviction was quashed .

simon daglish , 40 , ed farquhar , 39 , james daly , 41 , and roger weatherby , 43 , will pull a heavy wooden sledge across the original route .
they will be equipped with reindeer-skin sleeping bags and eat biscuits made to a 1912 recipe .
guide geoff somers , 54 , from keswick , cumbria , vowed to return safely .
captain scott 's doomed mission started in 1910 , but after a series of setbacks , arrived at the south pole on 17 january 1912 , only to realise norwegian explorer roald amundsen had beaten them by a month .
on the return journey captain scott and his four colleagues perished .
the 2005 team will not be using modern waterproof tents , thermal clothing , or energy-rich meals .
but they will take some modern equipment such as gps satellite navigation .
scott 's team all perished on their expedition mr daglish said : " we are going to the same place and using the same equipment as scott did .
" we will be navigating using a theodolite and the biscuit-makers huntley palmer have made us 30,000 biscuits from the same recipe as those made for scott .
" we have made some changes where it would be have been foolish not to .
we will have gps as a back-up , because scott 's men were naval men and had more experience , and the goggles they used caused snow blindness , so we are using modern lenses but in the same leather frames . "
the men , who are raising money for baby charity tommy 's , racing welfare and the winnicott foundation , which cares for premature babies , are starting 170 miles from the south pole and hope to reach their target on 17 january .

a government spokesman said the defeat went against public opinion and the desires of china 's central leadership .
on wednesday , hong kong 's legislators rejected chief executive donald tsang 's reforms , saying they did not go far enough towards full democracy .
mr tsang said the rejection meant the territory had missed a " significant step " forward .
pro-democracy lawmakers blocked both of his main proposals - to expand the committee responsible for electing the chief executive and to increase the size of the legislature .
the opposition camp opposes for sake of opposition china daily -lrb- hong kong edition -rrb- hk press reaction they said neither proposal went far enough towards setting a timetable for full democracy in hong kong , which is governed as a special administrative region of china .
earlier mr tsang said his proposals went as far as china and its allies in hong kong would allow .
the bbc 's hong kong correspondent , chris hogg , says the defeat will probably confirm beijing 's suspicion that the territory 's democrats are untrustworthy and unpatriotic - the very reasons , some analysts say , that china is reluctant to offer hong kong true democracy .
' regrettable ' a spokesman for the hong kong and macao affairs office of china 's state council said wednesday 's legislative vote was " not in line with the mainstream " of public opinion in hong kong .
donald tsang said the rejection of his proposals was " regrettable " the defeated proposal had represented " the principle of developing hong kong democracy in proper order , " he told xinhua news agency , adding that the central government in beijing was " unwilling to see the result " .
mr tsang said the rejection of his plans for electoral reform meant hong kong had lost a " significant step " towards democracy .
he said he would not now offer an alternative before elections in 2007 .
speaking at a late-night news conference after wednesday 's vote , he called the result " regrettable " and warned of a serious split over constitutional reform .
but pro-democracy legislators insisted mr tsang 's proposals were not ambitious enough .
" in this era of democracy , we do not see how hong kong people can be deprived of equality and one person , one vote , " legislator lee cheuk-yan told reuters news agency .
tens of thousands of people marched through the territory earlier this month to demand universal suffrage .
since hong kong 's sovereignty was handed back to china by britain in 1997 , the territory has been governed under a mini-constitution known as the basic law .
that stipulates that the chief executive should be elected by 800 people approved by beijing .
although it states that the eventual aim is to introduce universal suffrage , it does not give a target date .

' regrettable ' a spokesman for the hong kong and macao affairs office of china 's state council said wednesday 's legislative vote was " not in line with the mainstream " of public opinion in hong kong .
donald tsang said the rejection of his proposals was " regrettable " the defeated proposal had represented " the principle of developing hong kong democracy in proper order , " he told xinhua news agency , adding that the central government in beijing was " unwilling to see the result " .
mr tsang said the rejection of his plans for electoral reform meant hong kong had lost a " significant step " towards democracy .
he said he would not now offer an alternative before elections in 2007 .
speaking at a late-night news conference after wednesday 's vote , he called the result " regrettable " and warned of a serious split over constitutional reform .
but pro-democracy legislators insisted mr tsang 's proposals were not ambitious enough .
" in this era of democracy , we do not see how hong kong people can be deprived of equality and one person , one vote , " legislator lee cheuk-yan told reuters news agency .
tens of thousands of people marched through the territory earlier this month to demand universal suffrage .
since hong kong 's sovereignty was handed back to china by britain in 1997 , the territory has been governed under a mini-constitution known as the basic law .
that stipulates that the chief executive should be elected by 800 people approved by beijing .
although it states that the eventual aim is to introduce universal suffrage , it does not give a target date .

the us aerospace giant expects to complete orders for 112 of the aircraft during 2008-09 , up from 96 .
boeing added that it expected to end this year with 254 orders for the jet .
the firm has staked much of its future on the success of the 787 , and has been competing fiercely for orders with european rival airbus ' a350 aircraft .
long range earlier this month , boeing clinched a deal with australian carrier qantas for at least 65 dreamliner 787 jets in a deal worth $ 10bn -lrb- £ 5.7bn -rrb- .
boeing expects to begin production of the 787 in 2007 and deliver the first of the aircraft the following year .
the company says its long-range 787 aircraft , which is designed to seat up to 250 passengers , will be 20 % more fuel-efficient than similar mid-sized planes .
it said it expected interest in the 787 to remain stronger among airlines in europe and asia , but added it saw potential for orders from some big us carriers .
boeing said it was considering developing a longer version of the 787 , able to carry up to 300 passengers , although the firm stressed that work on the aircraft would not begin until at least 2012 .
while it aims to have 254 firm orders for the 787 by the end of this year , it has an additional 100 provisional orders , approximately .

but nearly nine in 10 still like to gift shop in towns and cities and 75 % also support their local retailers .
the average festive spend was £ 720 per person - a higher figure , it is claimed , than the rest of the uk .
but a retail analyst said the level of online shopping in wales was " average or slightly below " the uk as a whole .
analyst judith clegg said the poll 's results also supported the boom in online buying generally brought about by three factors - more accessible broadband ; customers being sure of delivery and more bargains available over the net .
results of wales christmas spending poll average spend of £ 720 rising to £ 1,014 among 35-54 age group 26 presents bought on average , with women -lrb- 32 -rrb- buying more than men -lrb- 19 -rrb- 86 % buy in towns or city centres , 76 % also buying in local shops .
out-of-town also popular -lrb- 50 % -rrb- while 30 % buy online and 24 % shop outside wales according to ms clegg , there has been a 50 % increase in online shopping in the last few months across the uk .
" grocery shopping online alone has risen from five to 17 % in the last three months , " she said .
she said the poll showed people in wales were spending more than the rest of the uk on buying gifts , while people living elsewhere would rather spend on eating out .
wrexham council worker jane purdie , 38 , has shopped for about 75 % of her gifts online .
she said : " i have done more this year than in the past , mainly because i 'm so busy at work .
i do find it very convenient .
" they have got better and they do deliver things the next day .
and they nearly always deliver in plain cardboard boxes which means they stay hidden from the kids . "
fifty presents , many for sons jake , 11 , and greg , 10 , and husband shaun , have been bought in forays onto the net in the evening , mrs purdie said .
" i buy toys , books , cds , dvds - even clothes although i 'm a bit iffy about that , " she said .
jane purdie : three quarters of her shopping has been online steve aicheler from wales-based website blushing buyer.co.uk said turnover was up 20 % this christmas .
he said : " the online industry has matured over the last three years .
people know what they are doing now .
they are making promises that they can keep .
" people know for a fact that they can order items and they will turn up .
they can also buy items they wo n't find on the high street . "
old-fashioned shopping appears to be losing out as consumers wait for sales and promotions to begin , say retailers .
richard garratt from the mcarthurglen designer outlet at bridgend said a lot more people had visited the centre in the run-up to christmas but they had held back on their spending until the last week before christmas .
asked whether sales would be up on last year , he said it was " too difficult to call " .
he added : " we have been selling a lot more products but the item value has dropped and we 're having to sell a lot more just to draw level . "
' absolutely fabulous ' david hughes-lewis , chair of cardiff retail partnership , agreed customers had been spending less money .
he said : " we all expected that it would be a funny christmas in as much as people were holding back , waiting for retailers going to put on sales and promotions .
" it was late coming , but it 's absolutely fabulous now .
cardiff is booming this week . "
shoppers still like to go into the city centre shops as opposed to clicking on a website , mr hughes-lewis said .
he added : " at the end of the day shopping is retail therapy for most people . " 1,055 people across wales were quizzed in the phone poll by icm earlier this month .

there had been predictions that online shopping would rise by as much as a third this year , with many people opting to order their gifts from the comfort of their own home .
more and more people are turning to the internet this christmas certainly , sendit.com , which is probably the biggest northern ireland-based online business , has experienced its busiest year to date .
the christmas rush is nearly over with only a few last-minute orders for dvds and videos to complete , but the company is now looking at ways to expand .
joanne uprichard of sendit.com said : " the last few christmases people were testing it out and this christmas they were more than happy to order a greater percentage of their gifts online .
" we know we can sell dvds to our customers .
we want to sell related products as well .
" we know they 're playing games online so we want to sell them games consoles and video games as well . "
this year , royal mail expects to handle 3.5m packages at christmas - a growth of 50 % or more over the past five years .
internet orders placed several days ago have been sorted at the royal mail centre in mallusk , county antrim .
extra staff have been taken on to cope with the increasing volumes of mail .
the good news for belfast is that we have seen more people than ever coming into the city centre joanne jennings belfast city centre manager david peden of royal mail said that the same company names cropped up again and again in the post .
" we have seen tremendous growth over the last number of years .

" we expect it will grow and we are very well geared up to meet those demands . "
there had been predictions that up to £ 5bn could be spent online in november and december this year .

however , despite the boom in internet sales , hoards of people have been out and about in belfast city centre - many of whom had also shopped online .
many items are discounted in belfast city centre belfast city centre manager joanne jennings said : " there was a view that we would have a very poor christmas this year .
" the good news for belfast is that we have seen more people than ever coming into the city centre .

" the good news for the customer is that there 's a lot of pre-christmas sales , there 's a lot of bargains , there 's a lot of heavy discounting and we 'll see how that really turns out at the end . "
bbc northern ireland business editor james kerr said : " internet shopping is likely to grow , it is likely to continue to grow quite quickly .
" that will keep the pressure on some of the traditional retailers .
" but that pressure is in turn good for the customers : more competition , more choice . "

easyjet said the planes would be delivered during 2008 and 2009 and would help ensure its " continued growth to the end of the decade " .
last month the airline announced that passenger numbers had risen 21 % to 29.6m in 2005 , helping to deliver a 9 % rise in profits to £ 68m .

under the terms of that agreement easyjet had the right to buy up to 120 extra jets at the same basic price , subject to inflation .
earlier this week , low-cost rival ryanair said the late delivery of four new aircraft would lead to it carrying 100,000 fewer passengers each month between january and march .
it blamed a strike at manufacturer boeing earlier this year for the problems , but said they would have little effect on its profit forecasts .

the nfu claims farmers are enthusiastic about such uses for their crop but a price of £ 10 a tonne was well below production costs .

row to ' continue ' ross haddow , of the nfu 's sugar committee , said no farmer was going to grow extra beet for bioethanol fuel production at such a price .
the row was likely to continue because " farmers will plan to be extra careful and produce just enough to meet their quota commitments in future " , he added .
and the price of £ 10 a tonne would persuade many to seek out other more profitable markets , said mr haddow .

there will be no christmas presents in nasim bannoura 's house this year .
the palestinian christian lives minutes from a site where , according to tradition , angels told shepherds of the birth of jesus .
but he can barely afford to feed his two teenage children , let alone buy them gifts .
in recent years they have gone to bed hungry " many times " , he says .
a carpenter , like jesus ' father joseph , he has had little work for the five years of the palestinian intifada .
curfews , closures and the newly-built west bank barrier have cut him off from business in jerusalem .
fears of violence have kept the tourists away and with them the financial lifeblood of bethlehem , the birthplace of christ , a few minutes drive from nasim 's home in the town of beit sahour .
economic woes louis michel is a licensed palestinian tour guide , fluent in french and english . "
i believe we should stay to challenge the occupation , not emigrate and let the israelis take our land " palestinian christian khalil hanania holy land christians ' decline before the intifada , his tour groups had to queue two or three hours to enter the underground grotto held to mark the site of the birth of jesus .
now pilgrims walk straight in .
in the last few days , he says , only about five families have paid for his services .
louis ' life savings are long spent and his three children all sleep in one room .
but , he says , tourist numbers have increased a little this year , and he repeats the mantra echoing from the ministry of tourism to the souvenir shops : " we hope more will come this christmas . "
although the dire economic situation has affected christians and muslims alike , emigration from bethlehem is higher among christians , who are helped by higher levels of education and better contacts in western countries .
catholic civil engineer khalil hanania , 22 , was part of a close-knit group of seven friends at school .
" now i am alone , six of my best friends emigrated - america , london , australia , france , " he says .
' prison ' but , despite seeing two university friends killed during the intifada , he is committed to staying .
" i believe we should stay to challenge the occupation , not emigrate and let the israelis take our land - especially as we are living in the land of jesus .
it 's a gift from god , although we suffer , " he says .
but others simply want out .
" if i had a job offer , i would like to leave and never look back , " says randa dallal .
after losing a grocery business during the first intifada and cowering in a basement at the height of second , she says now the worst thing is " the feeling that i am in prison " because of the barrier and israeli travel restrictions .
as christmas approaches , her 17-year-old son sari checks daily for the arrival of his permit to travel 20 minutes ' drive to east jerusalem to see his sister on christmas eve .
" we 're a minority and every year there are less and less .
the younger generation , if they leave to study , will not return , " she says .
there are also mixed feelings among christians about the palestinian uprising and the radical islamic groups behind it .
" this intifada has bad results for all .
i think things have gone back 50 years .
the muslims support it more , " says christian souvenir shop owner peter canavati .
' co-existence ' elections this year have seen hamas take five of the 15 seats on bethlehem 's city council .
if support for such groups continues to increase , says another christian souvenir seller , " we will feel like tourists here . "
a few christians speak privately of harassment , muslims seizing christian land and the fear of speaking out against radical groups .
but many others say they live like brothers with their muslim neighbours , sharing the struggle against israeli occupation .
george sa 'adeh is the deputy mayor of bethlehem and principal of a greek orthodox high school in nearby beit sahour .
his 12-year-old daughter christine was killed in 2003 .
israeli forces targeting hamas militants opened fire on his car by accident , he says .
he considers her a martyr for the palestinian cause .
" we believe christine is an angel now , " he says .
" we get on with our life , but it 's not easy .
we are all human beings - jewish , christian and muslim .
losing a child is the same pain for all of us . "
mr sa 'adeh says the palestinian authority designates that the mayor and deputy mayor of bethlehem must be christian and points out that the new council make-up is the outcome of a democratic process .
" bethlehem is a symbol of co-existence , " he says .
hoping for pilgrims tensions remain , however .
on tuesday , with only four days to go until the all important christmas eve mass , masked gunmen swept into the city hall as local officials gathered to open a christmas bazaar a few streets away . "
we hope tourists will come and see that bethlehem is a nice , safe place " souvenir seller peter canavati for a jittery hour the gunmen occupied the roof of the building while armed palestinian security forces gathered in the square below - a scene unusual for bethlehem , although not uncommon elsewhere in the west bank .
the episode was reportedly a dispute over unpaid salaries within mahmoud abbas ' ruling fatah party .
but a few christian onlookers were quick to interpret it as a muslim-driven plan to sabotage christmas in bethlehem .
by far the main concern , however , was not who was behind it , but whether the television pictures would scare off pilgrims .
" it will hit us hard , " said souvenir seller peter canavati .
" but we hope tourists will come and see that bethlehem is a nice , safe place .
we hope that they will come . "
heather sharp is in israel and the west bank on a research visit funded by the alexander onassis trust .

a few christians speak privately of harassment , muslims seizing christian land and the fear of speaking out against radical groups .

george sa 'adeh is the deputy mayor of bethlehem and principal of a greek orthodox high school in nearby beit sahour .
his 12-year-old daughter christine was killed in 2003 .
israeli forces targeting hamas militants opened fire on his car by accident , he says .
he considers her a martyr for the palestinian cause .
" we believe christine is an angel now , " he says .
" we get on with our life , but it 's not easy .
we are all human beings - jewish , christian and muslim .
losing a child is the same pain for all of us . "
mr sa 'adeh says the palestinian authority designates that the mayor and deputy mayor of bethlehem must be christian and points out that the new council make-up is the outcome of a democratic process .
" bethlehem is a symbol of co-existence , " he says .

the episode was reportedly a dispute over unpaid salaries within mahmoud abbas ' ruling fatah party .
but a few christian onlookers were quick to interpret it as a muslim-driven plan to sabotage christmas in bethlehem .
by far the main concern , however , was not who was behind it , but whether the television pictures would scare off pilgrims .

but many others say they live like brothers with their muslim neighbours , sharing the struggle against israeli occupation .
george sa 'adeh is the deputy mayor of bethlehem and principal of a greek orthodox high school in nearby beit sahour .
his 12-year-old daughter christine was killed in 2003 .
israeli forces targeting hamas militants opened fire on his car by accident , he says .
he considers her a martyr for the palestinian cause .
" we believe christine is an angel now , " he says .
" we get on with our life , but it 's not easy .
we are all human beings - jewish , christian and muslim .
losing a child is the same pain for all of us . "
mr sa 'adeh says the palestinian authority designates that the mayor and deputy mayor of bethlehem must be christian and points out that the new council make-up is the outcome of a democratic process .
" bethlehem is a symbol of co-existence , " he says .
hoping for pilgrims tensions remain , however .
on tuesday , with only four days to go until the all important christmas eve mass , masked gunmen swept into the city hall as local officials gathered to open a christmas bazaar a few streets away .
we hope tourists will come and see that bethlehem is a nice , safe place souvenir seller peter canavati for a jittery hour the gunmen occupied the roof of the building while armed palestinian security forces gathered in the square below - a scene unusual for bethlehem , although not uncommon elsewhere in the west bank .
the episode was reportedly a dispute over unpaid salaries within mahmoud abbas ' ruling fatah party .
but a few christian onlookers were quick to interpret it as a muslim-driven plan to sabotage christmas in bethlehem .
by far the main concern , however , was not who was behind it , but whether the television pictures would scare off pilgrims .
" it will hit us hard , " said souvenir seller peter canavati .
" but we hope tourists will come and see that bethlehem is a nice , safe place .
we hope that they will come . "
