in germany , beer has always been a national symbol , a local pride , and a diet staple .
now it has been given a new role : election indicator . the bundespressestrand , a bar set in the shadow of the reichstag , has decided to measure its patrons ' thirst for change - one beer at a time .
two weeks ago , the beach-themed cafe on the river spree began an unusual - some might say uniquely german - poll to predict the outcome of planned national elections .
pick a tap , a n y tap called " vote with your throat , " the poll , sponsored by the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d newspaper , consists of two beer taps , each one decorated in honor one of an election candidate .
planning to vote conservative ?
then order a merkel pilsner -lrb- from the black tap . -rrb-
prefer to stick to the current regime ?
the point to the red tap for a schröder pilsner .
the volume of beer poured is digitally measured , and published daily on the paper 's web site .
so far , the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is in the lead with 1,312 liters -lrb- 346.5 gallons -rrb- , a fact that head bartender andre belitz attributes to " berliners anticipating the goodbye party for the spd , " he told the paper .
he said many of those who ordered the schröder pilsner told him they were drinking it " to drown their illusions . "
supporters of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on the other hand have so far only drunk 1,199 liters . but in the end , it all does n't really seem too matter : a merkel pilsner and a schröder pilsner may come out of different taps , but they both pour the exact same beer . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 to read about the latest developments in the upcoming general election , the candidates and the key issues involved , click through the links in dw world 's election dossier .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .
the european commission has repeatedly said that the benes decrees are in line with eu legislation . preside n t war n s resolutio n 's effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus czech president vaclav klaus , a vociferous opponent of any concessions , called the resolution " a conceptually wrong , useless and empty gesture , which can hurt the czech republic and its interests . " many czech politicians have expressed concerns that rendering the decrees invalid could prompt a wave of lawsuits and property claims .
paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 germany to reform pre-school education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say kindergarten kids should be doing more than coloring a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany . in recent years , there 's been a growing realization in germany that kindergarten is n't just a place for children to romp and play , but also where they begin to learn the ropes of reading , writing and arithmetic - skills that are usually associated with school-age kids .
a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .
even in hungary and norway , the curriculum for kindergartens invites children and parents to choose between specializing in different topics , with the emphasis being on music , playing instruments and reading notes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin schools on a learning curve as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual .

a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 25.08.2005 gregor gysi : portrait of a political charmer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi : at home on the political stage the media-savvy leader of the new left party is fighting his election campaign with former social democrat heavyweight oskar lafontaine : together they are causing a stir in german politics . gregor gysi is to the recently renamed left party / pds what joschka fischer is to the greens or gerhard schröder to the social democrats : a political charmer as much as a party figurehead .
the new party , the successor to the east german communist party , is pinning all its hopes for the coming election on the 57-year-old berliner . although there are those who criticize the party 's new course , not even the critics contest that without gysi the left party / pds would not have gotten anywhere near as much media attention as it has since its inception in late spring . thanks to gysi 's involvement , the party 's prospects for the upcoming parliamentary elections are vastly improved .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the communist party in former east germany , had established itself as a major party at state level in eastern germany during the 1990s .
however in the 2002 parliamentary elections , following gysi 's temporary withdrawal from politics due to an air-miles scandal , it fell short of the 5 percent threshold necessary for inclusion in the federal parliament . his return to politics late last year was warmly welcomed by party rank and file .
but still gysi delayed his comeback for health reasons . at home o n the political stage now back in politics , gysi has not lost his charm , and he 's just as much in demand on german talk shows as ever before .
owing to his finely-honed rhetoric , he has been able to win affection in western germany , where other pds members have failed . his charisma will serve him well in the alliance with former spd chief oskar lafontaine .
opinion polls show that the two will win far more votes as allies than they would do individually . bildunterschrift : gysi and his politica ally , oskar lafontaine breaki n g from the past changing perceptions of east germany remains a priority for gysi . " we need to learn to see east germany as an opportunity for our nation , " he said .
" that means a change of mentality , a cultural change , and also a change in the media .
we need a new zeitgeist . " germans should not denounce everything associated with the former east germany , he argues . but gysi 's own past has come back to haunt him on several occasions .
he was responsible for the transition of the former communist party into the pds in 1990 .
for a number of years thereafter he had to fight accusations that he had worked for the stasi , the east german secret police . some accuse gysi of backing out of politics in 2002 when things turned tough for him .
gysi rebukes such claims . " i went through a lot during my time in parliament : 11 years and countless attempts to get rid of me , " he argues .
" but i stayed .
i do n't give up that easily . " marcel fürstenau -lrb- oh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we ca n't realistically hope to win " germany 's new left party has been rising in the polls and is likely to enter germany 's parliament after elections scheduled for sept .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful .

paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .

but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .

this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ?

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .
the european commission has repeatedly said that the benes decrees are in line with eu legislation . preside n t war n s resolutio n 's effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus czech president vaclav klaus , a vociferous opponent of any concessions , called the resolution " a conceptually wrong , useless and empty gesture , which can hurt the czech republic and its interests . " many czech politicians have expressed concerns that rendering the decrees invalid could prompt a wave of lawsuits and property claims .
paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the communist party in former east germany , had established itself as a major party at state level in eastern germany during the 1990s .

he was responsible for the transition of the former communist party into the pds in 1990 .
for a number of years thereafter he had to fight accusations that he had worked for the stasi , the east german secret police . some accuse gysi of backing out of politics in 2002 when things turned tough for him .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .
in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects .
-lrb- march 17 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : peace the underlying goal the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .

paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

the new party , the successor to the east german communist party , is pinning all its hopes for the coming election on the 57-year-old berliner . although there are those who criticize the party 's new course , not even the critics contest that without gysi the left party / pds would not have gotten anywhere near as much media attention as it has since its inception in late spring . thanks to gysi 's involvement , the party 's prospects for the upcoming parliamentary elections are vastly improved .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the communist party in former east germany , had established itself as a major party at state level in eastern germany during the 1990s .
however in the 2002 parliamentary elections , following gysi 's temporary withdrawal from politics due to an air-miles scandal , it fell short of the 5 percent threshold necessary for inclusion in the federal parliament . his return to politics late last year was warmly welcomed by party rank and file .
but still gysi delayed his comeback for health reasons . at home o n the political stage now back in politics , gysi has not lost his charm , and he 's just as much in demand on german talk shows as ever before .
owing to his finely-honed rhetoric , he has been able to win affection in western germany , where other pds members have failed . his charisma will serve him well in the alliance with former spd chief oskar lafontaine .
opinion polls show that the two will win far more votes as allies than they would do individually . bildunterschrift : gysi and his politica ally , oskar lafontaine breaki n g from the past changing perceptions of east germany remains a priority for gysi . " we need to learn to see east germany as an opportunity for our nation , " he said .
" that means a change of mentality , a cultural change , and also a change in the media .
we need a new zeitgeist . " germans should not denounce everything associated with the former east germany , he argues . but gysi 's own past has come back to haunt him on several occasions .
he was responsible for the transition of the former communist party into the pds in 1990 .
for a number of years thereafter he had to fight accusations that he had worked for the stasi , the east german secret police . some accuse gysi of backing out of politics in 2002 when things turned tough for him .
gysi rebukes such claims . " i went through a lot during my time in parliament : 11 years and countless attempts to get rid of me , " he argues .
" but i stayed .
i do n't give up that easily .

however in the 2002 parliamentary elections , following gysi 's temporary withdrawal from politics due to an air-miles scandal , it fell short of the 5 percent threshold necessary for inclusion in the federal parliament . his return to politics late last year was warmly welcomed by party rank and file .
but still gysi delayed his comeback for health reasons . at home o n the political stage now back in politics , gysi has not lost his charm , and he 's just as much in demand on german talk shows as ever before .
owing to his finely-honed rhetoric , he has been able to win affection in western germany , where other pds members have failed . his charisma will serve him well in the alliance with former spd chief oskar lafontaine .
opinion polls show that the two will win far more votes as allies than they would do individually . bildunterschrift : gysi and his politica ally , oskar lafontaine breaki n g from the past changing perceptions of east germany remains a priority for gysi . " we need to learn to see east germany as an opportunity for our nation , " he said .
" that means a change of mentality , a cultural change , and also a change in the media .
we need a new zeitgeist . " germans should not denounce everything associated with the former east germany , he argues . but gysi 's own past has come back to haunt him on several occasions .
he was responsible for the transition of the former communist party into the pds in 1990 .
for a number of years thereafter he had to fight accusations that he had worked for the stasi , the east german secret police . some accuse gysi of backing out of politics in 2002 when things turned tough for him .
gysi rebukes such claims . " i went through a lot during my time in parliament : 11 years and countless attempts to get rid of me , " he argues .
" but i stayed .
i do n't give up that easily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 germany to reform pre-school education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say kindergarten kids should be doing more than coloring a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany . in recent years , there 's been a growing realization in germany that kindergarten is n't just a place for children to romp and play , but also where they begin to learn the ropes of reading , writing and arithmetic - skills that are usually associated with school-age kids .
a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .
even in hungary and norway , the curriculum for kindergartens invites children and parents to choose between specializing in different topics , with the emphasis being on music , playing instruments and reading notes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin schools on a learning curve as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual .

18 an early general election in germany will take place on sept .
18 after the country 's constitutional court judges on thursday threw out complaints challenging the constitutionality of an early poll . germany 's highest court on thursday gave the go-ahead for an early general election , removing the final hurdle to the sept .
18 poll . the federal constitutional court ruled seven-to-one to reject the complaints of two lawmakers who had argued that chancellor gerhard schröder 's deliberate loss of a parliamentary no-confidence to bring the poll forward by one year violated germany 's basic law . " the complaints are unfounded , " the court 's vice-president winfried hassemer said .
" we have come to a clear decision . " " the court was seen as having had the choice between the plague and cholera , " hassemer said , acknowledging widespread fears that stopping the election would have plunged the country into political turmoil . " the plague is the initiation of a state crisis with the court trying to stop the election campaign that is already sweeping the country .
and cholera is the attempt to avoid a state crisis by bending the constitution .
in this view , the court could only make mistakes . " but hassemer said the court had eventually come to the conclusion that it could give the chancellor broad scope to determine himself whether he had a sufficient majority to govern without undermining important constitutional checks and balances . schröder announced in may that he would seek an early election to win a fresh mandate after his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- suffered the latest in a humiliating series of state poll defeats . bildunterschrift : politicians can finally campaign without fearing the election might not take place germany 's basic law only allows the federal president to dissolve parliament , so schröder was forced to seek the no-confidence vote on july 1 to set the wheels for a new election in motion . the vast majority of deputies from the spd and its junior coalition partner , the greens , defeated the confidence measure by following a request by party leaders to abstain . three weeks later , president horst köhler agreed to bring the election forward , saying the country needed stronger leadership to face its " immense tasks " including tackling unemployment , cutting the public debt and contending with an aging population with too few children . " in this serious situation , our country needs a new government that can pursue its goals with continuity and emphasis , " köhler said .

it could also deal a blow to chancellor gerhard schröder just weeks before he faces voters at a general election , in which economic anxieties are expected to play a key role . the key business climate index compiled monthly by the ifo economic research institute edged lower to 94.6 points in august from 95.0 in july , it said in a statement .

however , the second half of 2005 will be better than the first .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 full steam ahead for election campaigns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder feels the court decision has given him backing in his quest the decision to allow early elections in germany has been interpreted as support by gerhard schröder , who said he can now pursue his new mandate .
his opponents also seem to be relishing the now official contest . germany 's highest court has ruled that next month 's parliamentary election in germany can go ahead , dismissing a claim that the path chosen by chancellor gerhard schröder to bring about the early vote was unconstitutional . schröder now considers himself to have the full backing of the constitutional court and hopes for fresh tailwind in his bid for re-election . " it is now clear that voters will be electing a new parliament on sept .
18 , " schröder said .
" this has been my prime intention , because i 'm seeking a new mandate for my reform policy - a policy which will make germany strong again without threatening social cohesion . " schröder asked for the general election to be brought forward 12 months after a crushing defeat in the key regional election in the former social democrat stronghold of north-rhine westphalia in may that has shaken his authority . he paved the way for it by deliberately losing a vote of confidence in parliament .
but rebels in his red-green alliance challenged the move arguing the vote was engineered , and infringed on their rights as mps . " a defeat for parliame n tary democracy " werner schulz from the green party was one of those who challenged the chancellor 's tactics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz " this is not my personal defeat ; it 's a defeat for parliamentary democracy in germany , " schulz said .
" what 's been strengthened by this ruling is the role of the chancellor in the system .
so in future every time a chancellor suspects , assumes or even thinks to assume that he has no majority anymore , he is allowed to send home the entire parliament . " but the decision stands and germany will go to the polls on sept .

" liberal free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle echoed merkel 's sentiments by saying that the " way is free for a new beginning in germany . "
the fdp 's expert on economics , rolf kutzmutz , added that in 24 days , people all over germany would have the chance to reverse the policies of " social dismantling , pension shortening , wage reduction and curtailment of employee 's rights . " stoiber relieved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian state premier and christian social union chief edmund stoiber sounded relieved when he said " thank god the way is now clear for a necessary change in germany . " german president horst köhler , who took the step to disband parliament after schröder gambled with a no-confidence vote , said : " now the voters have a chance to have an influence over the future of our country .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .

of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .

a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .
even in hungary and norway , the curriculum for kindergartens invites children and parents to choose between specializing in different topics , with the emphasis being on music , playing instruments and reading notes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin schools on a learning curve as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 germany to reform pre-school education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say kindergarten kids should be doing more than coloring a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany . in recent years , there 's been a growing realization in germany that kindergarten is n't just a place for children to romp and play , but also where they begin to learn the ropes of reading , writing and arithmetic - skills that are usually associated with school-age kids .
a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .
even in hungary and norway , the curriculum for kindergartens invites children and parents to choose between specializing in different topics , with the emphasis being on music , playing instruments and reading notes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin schools on a learning curve as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual .

18 an early general election in germany will take place on sept .
18 after the country 's constitutional court judges on thursday threw out complaints challenging the constitutionality of an early poll . germany 's highest court on thursday gave the go-ahead for an early general election , removing the final hurdle to the sept .
18 poll . the federal constitutional court ruled seven-to-one to reject the complaints of two lawmakers who had argued that chancellor gerhard schröder 's deliberate loss of a parliamentary no-confidence to bring the poll forward by one year violated germany 's basic law .

" the plague is the initiation of a state crisis with the court trying to stop the election campaign that is already sweeping the country .

he was responsible for the transition of the former communist party into the pds in 1990 .
for a number of years thereafter he had to fight accusations that he had worked for the stasi , the east german secret police . some accuse gysi of backing out of politics in 2002 when things turned tough for him .

his opponents also seem to be relishing the now official contest . germany 's highest court has ruled that next month 's parliamentary election in germany can go ahead , dismissing a claim that the path chosen by chancellor gerhard schröder to bring about the early vote was unconstitutional . schröder now considers himself to have the full backing of the constitutional court and hopes for fresh tailwind in his bid for re-election . " it is now clear that voters will be electing a new parliament on sept .
18 , " schröder said .
" this has been my prime intention , because i 'm seeking a new mandate for my reform policy - a policy which will make germany strong again without threatening social cohesion . " schröder asked for the general election to be brought forward 12 months after a crushing defeat in the key regional election in the former social democrat stronghold of north-rhine westphalia in may that has shaken his authority . he paved the way for it by deliberately losing a vote of confidence in parliament .
but rebels in his red-green alliance challenged the move arguing the vote was engineered , and infringed on their rights as mps .

" what 's been strengthened by this ruling is the role of the chancellor in the system .
so in future every time a chancellor suspects , assumes or even thinks to assume that he has no majority anymore , he is allowed to send home the entire parliament . " but the decision stands and germany will go to the polls on sept .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .

" many czech politicians have expressed concerns that rendering the decrees invalid could prompt a wave of lawsuits and property claims .
paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

18 an early general election in germany will take place on sept .
18 after the country 's constitutional court judges on thursday threw out complaints challenging the constitutionality of an early poll . germany 's highest court on thursday gave the go-ahead for an early general election , removing the final hurdle to the sept .
18 poll . the federal constitutional court ruled seven-to-one to reject the complaints of two lawmakers who had argued that chancellor gerhard schröder 's deliberate loss of a parliamentary no-confidence to bring the poll forward by one year violated germany 's basic law . " the complaints are unfounded , " the court 's vice-president winfried hassemer said .
" we have come to a clear decision . " " the court was seen as having had the choice between the plague and cholera , " hassemer said , acknowledging widespread fears that stopping the election would have plunged the country into political turmoil . " the plague is the initiation of a state crisis with the court trying to stop the election campaign that is already sweeping the country .
and cholera is the attempt to avoid a state crisis by bending the constitution .
in this view , the court could only make mistakes . " but hassemer said the court had eventually come to the conclusion that it could give the chancellor broad scope to determine himself whether he had a sufficient majority to govern without undermining important constitutional checks and balances . schröder announced in may that he would seek an early election to win a fresh mandate after his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- suffered the latest in a humiliating series of state poll defeats . bildunterschrift : politicians can finally campaign without fearing the election might not take place germany 's basic law only allows the federal president to dissolve parliament , so schröder was forced to seek the no-confidence vote on july 1 to set the wheels for a new election in motion . the vast majority of deputies from the spd and its junior coalition partner , the greens , defeated the confidence measure by following a request by party leaders to abstain . three weeks later , president horst köhler agreed to bring the election forward , saying the country needed stronger leadership to face its " immense tasks " including tackling unemployment , cutting the public debt and contending with an aging population with too few children . " in this serious situation , our country needs a new government that can pursue its goals with continuity and emphasis , " köhler said .

the new party , the successor to the east german communist party , is pinning all its hopes for the coming election on the 57-year-old berliner . although there are those who criticize the party 's new course , not even the critics contest that without gysi the left party / pds would not have gotten anywhere near as much media attention as it has since its inception in late spring . thanks to gysi 's involvement , the party 's prospects for the upcoming parliamentary elections are vastly improved .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the communist party in former east germany , had established itself as a major party at state level in eastern germany during the 1990s .
however in the 2002 parliamentary elections , following gysi 's temporary withdrawal from politics due to an air-miles scandal , it fell short of the 5 percent threshold necessary for inclusion in the federal parliament . his return to politics late last year was warmly welcomed by party rank and file .
but still gysi delayed his comeback for health reasons . at home o n the political stage now back in politics , gysi has not lost his charm , and he 's just as much in demand on german talk shows as ever before .
owing to his finely-honed rhetoric , he has been able to win affection in western germany , where other pds members have failed . his charisma will serve him well in the alliance with former spd chief oskar lafontaine .
opinion polls show that the two will win far more votes as allies than they would do individually . bildunterschrift : gysi and his politica ally , oskar lafontaine breaki n g from the past changing perceptions of east germany remains a priority for gysi . " we need to learn to see east germany as an opportunity for our nation , " he said .
" that means a change of mentality , a cultural change , and also a change in the media .

his opponents also seem to be relishing the now official contest . germany 's highest court has ruled that next month 's parliamentary election in germany can go ahead , dismissing a claim that the path chosen by chancellor gerhard schröder to bring about the early vote was unconstitutional . schröder now considers himself to have the full backing of the constitutional court and hopes for fresh tailwind in his bid for re-election .

" liberal free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle echoed merkel 's sentiments by saying that the " way is free for a new beginning in germany . "
the fdp 's expert on economics , rolf kutzmutz , added that in 24 days , people all over germany would have the chance to reverse the policies of " social dismantling , pension shortening , wage reduction and curtailment of employee 's rights . " stoiber relieved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian state premier and christian social union chief edmund stoiber sounded relieved when he said " thank god the way is now clear for a necessary change in germany .

18 after the country 's constitutional court judges on thursday threw out complaints challenging the constitutionality of an early poll . germany 's highest court on thursday gave the go-ahead for an early general election , removing the final hurdle to the sept .
18 poll . the federal constitutional court ruled seven-to-one to reject the complaints of two lawmakers who had argued that chancellor gerhard schröder 's deliberate loss of a parliamentary no-confidence to bring the poll forward by one year violated germany 's basic law . " the complaints are unfounded , " the court 's vice-president winfried hassemer said .
" we have come to a clear decision . " " the court was seen as having had the choice between the plague and cholera , " hassemer said , acknowledging widespread fears that stopping the election would have plunged the country into political turmoil . " the plague is the initiation of a state crisis with the court trying to stop the election campaign that is already sweeping the country .
and cholera is the attempt to avoid a state crisis by bending the constitution .
in this view , the court could only make mistakes . " but hassemer said the court had eventually come to the conclusion that it could give the chancellor broad scope to determine himself whether he had a sufficient majority to govern without undermining important constitutional checks and balances . schröder announced in may that he would seek an early election to win a fresh mandate after his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- suffered the latest in a humiliating series of state poll defeats . bildunterschrift : politicians can finally campaign without fearing the election might not take place germany 's basic law only allows the federal president to dissolve parliament , so schröder was forced to seek the no-confidence vote on july 1 to set the wheels for a new election in motion . the vast majority of deputies from the spd and its junior coalition partner , the greens , defeated the confidence measure by following a request by party leaders to abstain . three weeks later , president horst köhler agreed to bring the election forward , saying the country needed stronger leadership to face its " immense tasks " including tackling unemployment , cutting the public debt and contending with an aging population with too few children . " in this serious situation , our country needs a new government that can pursue its goals with continuity and emphasis , " köhler said .
" the well-being of the people is best served with a new election . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jelena hoffmann and werner schulz but the deputies who lodged the complaint , jelena hoffmann of social democrats and werner schulz of the greens , argued before the court that schröder clearly enjoyed the support of his coalition and called the vote " false " . but the court found that the state election debacles and fierce rows within the coalition over a tough social welfare reform package launched by schröder made the chancellor 's argument that his governing majority was endangered " plausible " . hassemer added that the court did not have the means to investigate the stability of the coalition and must thus rely on the federal chancellors ' own interpretations . if the judges had rejected the plan , schröder could have hung on in office until the end of his four-year term , though he would have been weakened politically and could have faced pressure to step aside . in an earlier ruling on tuesday , the court dismissed an attempt by two small parties - the ecological-democratic party and the family party of germany - to stop the early election . they were among a number of minor parties which had challenged the poll claiming that bringing the election forward by a year gave them too little time to prepare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court heard and rejected similar complaints in 1983 after then chancellor helmut kohl called and lost a vote of confidence in parliament which triggered early elections that he won .
his intention had been to get an even clearer mandate for a full four years . the german public is very much in favor of going to the polls : according to a recent survey , 73 percent of the population believes the fresh elections are necessary . dw staff / afp -lrb- win / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

18 an early general election in germany will take place on sept .
18 after the country 's constitutional court judges on thursday threw out complaints challenging the constitutionality of an early poll . germany 's highest court on thursday gave the go-ahead for an early general election , removing the final hurdle to the sept .

" the plague is the initiation of a state crisis with the court trying to stop the election campaign that is already sweeping the country .
and cholera is the attempt to avoid a state crisis by bending the constitution .
in this view , the court could only make mistakes . " but hassemer said the court had eventually come to the conclusion that it could give the chancellor broad scope to determine himself whether he had a sufficient majority to govern without undermining important constitutional checks and balances . schröder announced in may that he would seek an early election to win a fresh mandate after his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- suffered the latest in a humiliating series of state poll defeats . bildunterschrift : politicians can finally campaign without fearing the election might not take place germany 's basic law only allows the federal president to dissolve parliament , so schröder was forced to seek the no-confidence vote on july 1 to set the wheels for a new election in motion . the vast majority of deputies from the spd and its junior coalition partner , the greens , defeated the confidence measure by following a request by party leaders to abstain . three weeks later , president horst köhler agreed to bring the election forward , saying the country needed stronger leadership to face its " immense tasks " including tackling unemployment , cutting the public debt and contending with an aging population with too few children .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .

a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .

a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 full steam ahead for election campaigns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder feels the court decision has given him backing in his quest the decision to allow early elections in germany has been interpreted as support by gerhard schröder , who said he can now pursue his new mandate .
his opponents also seem to be relishing the now official contest . germany 's highest court has ruled that next month 's parliamentary election in germany can go ahead , dismissing a claim that the path chosen by chancellor gerhard schröder to bring about the early vote was unconstitutional . schröder now considers himself to have the full backing of the constitutional court and hopes for fresh tailwind in his bid for re-election . " it is now clear that voters will be electing a new parliament on sept .
18 , " schröder said .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .

" many czech politicians have expressed concerns that rendering the decrees invalid could prompt a wave of lawsuits and property claims .
paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 full steam ahead for election campaigns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder feels the court decision has given him backing in his quest the decision to allow early elections in germany has been interpreted as support by gerhard schröder , who said he can now pursue his new mandate .
his opponents also seem to be relishing the now official contest . germany 's highest court has ruled that next month 's parliamentary election in germany can go ahead , dismissing a claim that the path chosen by chancellor gerhard schröder to bring about the early vote was unconstitutional . schröder now considers himself to have the full backing of the constitutional court and hopes for fresh tailwind in his bid for re-election . " it is now clear that voters will be electing a new parliament on sept .
18 , " schröder said .
" this has been my prime intention , because i 'm seeking a new mandate for my reform policy - a policy which will make germany strong again without threatening social cohesion . " schröder asked for the general election to be brought forward 12 months after a crushing defeat in the key regional election in the former social democrat stronghold of north-rhine westphalia in may that has shaken his authority . he paved the way for it by deliberately losing a vote of confidence in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 germany to reform pre-school education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say kindergarten kids should be doing more than coloring a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany . in recent years , there 's been a growing realization in germany that kindergarten is n't just a place for children to romp and play , but also where they begin to learn the ropes of reading , writing and arithmetic - skills that are usually associated with school-age kids .
a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .
even in hungary and norway , the curriculum for kindergartens invites children and parents to choose between specializing in different topics , with the emphasis being on music , playing instruments and reading notes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin schools on a learning curve as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual .

his opponents also seem to be relishing the now official contest . germany 's highest court has ruled that next month 's parliamentary election in germany can go ahead , dismissing a claim that the path chosen by chancellor gerhard schröder to bring about the early vote was unconstitutional . schröder now considers himself to have the full backing of the constitutional court and hopes for fresh tailwind in his bid for re-election .

" schröder asked for the general election to be brought forward 12 months after a crushing defeat in the key regional election in the former social democrat stronghold of north-rhine westphalia in may that has shaken his authority . he paved the way for it by deliberately losing a vote of confidence in parliament .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .
the european commission has repeatedly said that the benes decrees are in line with eu legislation . preside n t war n s resolutio n 's effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus czech president vaclav klaus , a vociferous opponent of any concessions , called the resolution " a conceptually wrong , useless and empty gesture , which can hurt the czech republic and its interests . " many czech politicians have expressed concerns that rendering the decrees invalid could prompt a wave of lawsuits and property claims .
paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 germany to reform pre-school education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say kindergarten kids should be doing more than coloring a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany . in recent years , there 's been a growing realization in germany that kindergarten is n't just a place for children to romp and play , but also where they begin to learn the ropes of reading , writing and arithmetic - skills that are usually associated with school-age kids .
a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .
even in hungary and norway , the curriculum for kindergartens invites children and parents to choose between specializing in different topics , with the emphasis being on music , playing instruments and reading notes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin schools on a learning curve as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .
the european commission has repeatedly said that the benes decrees are in line with eu legislation . preside n t war n s resolutio n 's effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus czech president vaclav klaus , a vociferous opponent of any concessions , called the resolution " a conceptually wrong , useless and empty gesture , which can hurt the czech republic and its interests . " many czech politicians have expressed concerns that rendering the decrees invalid could prompt a wave of lawsuits and property claims .
paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

it could also deal a blow to chancellor gerhard schröder just weeks before he faces voters at a general election , in which economic anxieties are expected to play a key role . the key business climate index compiled monthly by the ifo economic research institute edged lower to 94.6 points in august from 95.0 in july , it said in a statement . " companies are a little disturbed ahead of the election , " ifo said . the figure fell below analysts ' consensus forecast of a slight rise to 95.2 points , helping send stocks lower in frankfurt .

" today 's figures do not amount to a major disappointment , " said sylvain broyer of banking services group cdc ixis .
" we see the decline in the ifo number in august as a simple correction after a strong gain . " " this is a disappointment .
it shows that rome was n't built in a day , " ralph solveen of commerzbank told reuters .
" people have frequently heralded growth , but we remain skeptical .
however , the second half of 2005 will be better than the first . " the ifo index had posted a marked rise in july to 95 from 93.3 in june . added jan-eric fillieule of ccf : " disappointment should be tempered , just as excessive optimism should .

the federal constitutional court ruled seven-to-one to reject complaints by two lawmakers who had argued that chancellor gerhard schröder 's deliberate loss of a parliamentary no-confidence to bring the poll forward by a year had violated germany 's basic law . conservative challenger angela merkel has said that if her christian union bloc is victorious it will focus on cutting unemployment which reached five million earlier this year , the highest level since world war ii . schröder sought new elections saying he could not continue implementing painful labor market reforms without a fresh pledge of support from the german people . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economy set to dominate german election now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits .

the new party , the successor to the east german communist party , is pinning all its hopes for the coming election on the 57-year-old berliner . although there are those who criticize the party 's new course , not even the critics contest that without gysi the left party / pds would not have gotten anywhere near as much media attention as it has since its inception in late spring . thanks to gysi 's involvement , the party 's prospects for the upcoming parliamentary elections are vastly improved .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the communist party in former east germany , had established itself as a major party at state level in eastern germany during the 1990s .
however in the 2002 parliamentary elections , following gysi 's temporary withdrawal from politics due to an air-miles scandal , it fell short of the 5 percent threshold necessary for inclusion in the federal parliament . his return to politics late last year was warmly welcomed by party rank and file .
but still gysi delayed his comeback for health reasons . at home o n the political stage now back in politics , gysi has not lost his charm , and he 's just as much in demand on german talk shows as ever before .
owing to his finely-honed rhetoric , he has been able to win affection in western germany , where other pds members have failed . his charisma will serve him well in the alliance with former spd chief oskar lafontaine .
opinion polls show that the two will win far more votes as allies than they would do individually . bildunterschrift : gysi and his politica ally , oskar lafontaine breaki n g from the past changing perceptions of east germany remains a priority for gysi . " we need to learn to see east germany as an opportunity for our nation , " he said .
" that means a change of mentality , a cultural change , and also a change in the media .
we need a new zeitgeist . " germans should not denounce everything associated with the former east germany , he argues . but gysi 's own past has come back to haunt him on several occasions .
he was responsible for the transition of the former communist party into the pds in 1990 .
for a number of years thereafter he had to fight accusations that he had worked for the stasi , the east german secret police . some accuse gysi of backing out of politics in 2002 when things turned tough for him .
gysi rebukes such claims . " i went through a lot during my time in parliament : 11 years and countless attempts to get rid of me , " he argues .
" but i stayed .
i do n't give up that easily .

his opponents also seem to be relishing the now official contest . germany 's highest court has ruled that next month 's parliamentary election in germany can go ahead , dismissing a claim that the path chosen by chancellor gerhard schröder to bring about the early vote was unconstitutional . schröder now considers himself to have the full backing of the constitutional court and hopes for fresh tailwind in his bid for re-election . " it is now clear that voters will be electing a new parliament on sept .
18 , " schröder said .
" this has been my prime intention , because i 'm seeking a new mandate for my reform policy - a policy which will make germany strong again without threatening social cohesion . " schröder asked for the general election to be brought forward 12 months after a crushing defeat in the key regional election in the former social democrat stronghold of north-rhine westphalia in may that has shaken his authority . he paved the way for it by deliberately losing a vote of confidence in parliament .
but rebels in his red-green alliance challenged the move arguing the vote was engineered , and infringed on their rights as mps . " a defeat for parliame n tary democracy " werner schulz from the green party was one of those who challenged the chancellor 's tactics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz " this is not my personal defeat ; it 's a defeat for parliamentary democracy in germany , " schulz said .
" what 's been strengthened by this ruling is the role of the chancellor in the system .
so in future every time a chancellor suspects , assumes or even thinks to assume that he has no majority anymore , he is allowed to send home the entire parliament . " but the decision stands and germany will go to the polls on sept .

" liberal free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle echoed merkel 's sentiments by saying that the " way is free for a new beginning in germany . "
the fdp 's expert on economics , rolf kutzmutz , added that in 24 days , people all over germany would have the chance to reverse the policies of " social dismantling , pension shortening , wage reduction and curtailment of employee 's rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 germany to reform pre-school education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say kindergarten kids should be doing more than coloring a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany . in recent years , there 's been a growing realization in germany that kindergarten is n't just a place for children to romp and play , but also where they begin to learn the ropes of reading , writing and arithmetic - skills that are usually associated with school-age kids .
a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 full steam ahead for election campaigns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder feels the court decision has given him backing in his quest the decision to allow early elections in germany has been interpreted as support by gerhard schröder , who said he can now pursue his new mandate .
his opponents also seem to be relishing the now official contest . germany 's highest court has ruled that next month 's parliamentary election in germany can go ahead , dismissing a claim that the path chosen by chancellor gerhard schröder to bring about the early vote was unconstitutional . schröder now considers himself to have the full backing of the constitutional court and hopes for fresh tailwind in his bid for re-election . " it is now clear that voters will be electing a new parliament on sept .
18 , " schröder said .
" this has been my prime intention , because i 'm seeking a new mandate for my reform policy - a policy which will make germany strong again without threatening social cohesion . " schröder asked for the general election to be brought forward 12 months after a crushing defeat in the key regional election in the former social democrat stronghold of north-rhine westphalia in may that has shaken his authority . he paved the way for it by deliberately losing a vote of confidence in parliament .
but rebels in his red-green alliance challenged the move arguing the vote was engineered , and infringed on their rights as mps . " a defeat for parliame n tary democracy " werner schulz from the green party was one of those who challenged the chancellor 's tactics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz " this is not my personal defeat ; it 's a defeat for parliamentary democracy in germany , " schulz said .
" what 's been strengthened by this ruling is the role of the chancellor in the system .
so in future every time a chancellor suspects , assumes or even thinks to assume that he has no majority anymore , he is allowed to send home the entire parliament . " but the decision stands and germany will go to the polls on sept .
18 - and the nation 's politicians , on the whole , welcomed the official go-ahead to an election campaign that has been up and running for weeks . merkel relishes chance of " new beginning " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel angela merkel , the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate called the decision by the karlsruhe court a chance for political change and said it would " put an end to the disappointing to-ing and fro-ing of the red-green government and open the way for a new union-controlled beginning . " liberal free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle echoed merkel 's sentiments by saying that the " way is free for a new beginning in germany . "
the fdp 's expert on economics , rolf kutzmutz , added that in 24 days , people all over germany would have the chance to reverse the policies of " social dismantling , pension shortening , wage reduction and curtailment of employee 's rights . " stoiber relieved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian state premier and christian social union chief edmund stoiber sounded relieved when he said " thank god the way is now clear for a necessary change in germany . " german president horst köhler , who took the step to disband parliament after schröder gambled with a no-confidence vote , said : " now the voters have a chance to have an influence over the future of our country .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .
in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects .
-lrb- march 17 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : peace the underlying goal the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .

15 , 2005 -rrb- germany , israel call for closer ties the german foreign minister met his israeli counterpart wednesday in düsseldorf to mark 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jelena hoffmann and werner schulz but the deputies who lodged the complaint , jelena hoffmann of social democrats and werner schulz of the greens , argued before the court that schröder clearly enjoyed the support of his coalition and called the vote " false " . but the court found that the state election debacles and fierce rows within the coalition over a tough social welfare reform package launched by schröder made the chancellor 's argument that his governing majority was endangered " plausible " . hassemer added that the court did not have the means to investigate the stability of the coalition and must thus rely on the federal chancellors ' own interpretations . if the judges had rejected the plan , schröder could have hung on in office until the end of his four-year term , though he would have been weakened politically and could have faced pressure to step aside . in an earlier ruling on tuesday , the court dismissed an attempt by two small parties - the ecological-democratic party and the family party of germany - to stop the early election . they were among a number of minor parties which had challenged the poll claiming that bringing the election forward by a year gave them too little time to prepare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court heard and rejected similar complaints in 1983 after then chancellor helmut kohl called and lost a vote of confidence in parliament which triggered early elections that he won .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .
the european commission has repeatedly said that the benes decrees are in line with eu legislation . preside n t war n s resolutio n 's effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus czech president vaclav klaus , a vociferous opponent of any concessions , called the resolution " a conceptually wrong , useless and empty gesture , which can hurt the czech republic and its interests . " many czech politicians have expressed concerns that rendering the decrees invalid could prompt a wave of lawsuits and property claims .
paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .

no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .

it could also deal a blow to chancellor gerhard schröder just weeks before he faces voters at a general election , in which economic anxieties are expected to play a key role . the key business climate index compiled monthly by the ifo economic research institute edged lower to 94.6 points in august from 95.0 in july , it said in a statement . " companies are a little disturbed ahead of the election , " ifo said . the figure fell below analysts ' consensus forecast of a slight rise to 95.2 points , helping send stocks lower in frankfurt .

" today 's figures do not amount to a major disappointment , " said sylvain broyer of banking services group cdc ixis .
" we see the decline in the ifo number in august as a simple correction after a strong gain . " " this is a disappointment .
it shows that rome was n't built in a day , " ralph solveen of commerzbank told reuters .
" people have frequently heralded growth , but we remain skeptical .
however , the second half of 2005 will be better than the first . " the ifo index had posted a marked rise in july to 95 from 93.3 in june . added jan-eric fillieule of ccf : " disappointment should be tempered , just as excessive optimism should . " good signs ahead ccf analysts pointed to " encouraging signs of recovery " in germany , notably in the areas of exports and business investment . ifo chief economist gernot nerb said oil prices and uncertainty over the general election , scheduled for sept .

18 an early general election in germany will take place on sept .
18 after the country 's constitutional court judges on thursday threw out complaints challenging the constitutionality of an early poll . germany 's highest court on thursday gave the go-ahead for an early general election , removing the final hurdle to the sept .
18 poll . the federal constitutional court ruled seven-to-one to reject the complaints of two lawmakers who had argued that chancellor gerhard schröder 's deliberate loss of a parliamentary no-confidence to bring the poll forward by one year violated germany 's basic law . " the complaints are unfounded , " the court 's vice-president winfried hassemer said .
" we have come to a clear decision . " " the court was seen as having had the choice between the plague and cholera , " hassemer said , acknowledging widespread fears that stopping the election would have plunged the country into political turmoil . " the plague is the initiation of a state crisis with the court trying to stop the election campaign that is already sweeping the country .
and cholera is the attempt to avoid a state crisis by bending the constitution .
in this view , the court could only make mistakes . " but hassemer said the court had eventually come to the conclusion that it could give the chancellor broad scope to determine himself whether he had a sufficient majority to govern without undermining important constitutional checks and balances . schröder announced in may that he would seek an early election to win a fresh mandate after his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- suffered the latest in a humiliating series of state poll defeats . bildunterschrift : politicians can finally campaign without fearing the election might not take place germany 's basic law only allows the federal president to dissolve parliament , so schröder was forced to seek the no-confidence vote on july 1 to set the wheels for a new election in motion . the vast majority of deputies from the spd and its junior coalition partner , the greens , defeated the confidence measure by following a request by party leaders to abstain . three weeks later , president horst köhler agreed to bring the election forward , saying the country needed stronger leadership to face its " immense tasks " including tackling unemployment , cutting the public debt and contending with an aging population with too few children . " in this serious situation , our country needs a new government that can pursue its goals with continuity and emphasis , " köhler said .
" the well-being of the people is best served with a new election . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jelena hoffmann and werner schulz but the deputies who lodged the complaint , jelena hoffmann of social democrats and werner schulz of the greens , argued before the court that schröder clearly enjoyed the support of his coalition and called the vote " false " . but the court found that the state election debacles and fierce rows within the coalition over a tough social welfare reform package launched by schröder made the chancellor 's argument that his governing majority was endangered " plausible " . hassemer added that the court did not have the means to investigate the stability of the coalition and must thus rely on the federal chancellors ' own interpretations . if the judges had rejected the plan , schröder could have hung on in office until the end of his four-year term , though he would have been weakened politically and could have faced pressure to step aside . in an earlier ruling on tuesday , the court dismissed an attempt by two small parties - the ecological-democratic party and the family party of germany - to stop the early election . they were among a number of minor parties which had challenged the poll claiming that bringing the election forward by a year gave them too little time to prepare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court heard and rejected similar complaints in 1983 after then chancellor helmut kohl called and lost a vote of confidence in parliament which triggered early elections that he won .
his intention had been to get an even clearer mandate for a full four years . the german public is very much in favor of going to the polls : according to a recent survey , 73 percent of the population believes the fresh elections are necessary . dw staff / afp -lrb- win / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

18 an early general election in germany will take place on sept .
18 after the country 's constitutional court judges on thursday threw out complaints challenging the constitutionality of an early poll . germany 's highest court on thursday gave the go-ahead for an early general election , removing the final hurdle to the sept .
18 poll . the federal constitutional court ruled seven-to-one to reject the complaints of two lawmakers who had argued that chancellor gerhard schröder 's deliberate loss of a parliamentary no-confidence to bring the poll forward by one year violated germany 's basic law . " the complaints are unfounded , " the court 's vice-president winfried hassemer said .
" we have come to a clear decision . " " the court was seen as having had the choice between the plague and cholera , " hassemer said , acknowledging widespread fears that stopping the election would have plunged the country into political turmoil . " the plague is the initiation of a state crisis with the court trying to stop the election campaign that is already sweeping the country .
and cholera is the attempt to avoid a state crisis by bending the constitution .
in this view , the court could only make mistakes . " but hassemer said the court had eventually come to the conclusion that it could give the chancellor broad scope to determine himself whether he had a sufficient majority to govern without undermining important constitutional checks and balances . schröder announced in may that he would seek an early election to win a fresh mandate after his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- suffered the latest in a humiliating series of state poll defeats . bildunterschrift : politicians can finally campaign without fearing the election might not take place germany 's basic law only allows the federal president to dissolve parliament , so schröder was forced to seek the no-confidence vote on july 1 to set the wheels for a new election in motion . the vast majority of deputies from the spd and its junior coalition partner , the greens , defeated the confidence measure by following a request by party leaders to abstain . three weeks later , president horst köhler agreed to bring the election forward , saying the country needed stronger leadership to face its " immense tasks " including tackling unemployment , cutting the public debt and contending with an aging population with too few children . " in this serious situation , our country needs a new government that can pursue its goals with continuity and emphasis , " köhler said .
" the well-being of the people is best served with a new election . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jelena hoffmann and werner schulz but the deputies who lodged the complaint , jelena hoffmann of social democrats and werner schulz of the greens , argued before the court that schröder clearly enjoyed the support of his coalition and called the vote " false " . but the court found that the state election debacles and fierce rows within the coalition over a tough social welfare reform package launched by schröder made the chancellor 's argument that his governing majority was endangered " plausible " . hassemer added that the court did not have the means to investigate the stability of the coalition and must thus rely on the federal chancellors ' own interpretations . if the judges had rejected the plan , schröder could have hung on in office until the end of his four-year term , though he would have been weakened politically and could have faced pressure to step aside . in an earlier ruling on tuesday , the court dismissed an attempt by two small parties - the ecological-democratic party and the family party of germany - to stop the early election . they were among a number of minor parties which had challenged the poll claiming that bringing the election forward by a year gave them too little time to prepare . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court heard and rejected similar complaints in 1983 after then chancellor helmut kohl called and lost a vote of confidence in parliament which triggered early elections that he won .
his intention had been to get an even clearer mandate for a full four years . the german public is very much in favor of going to the polls : according to a recent survey , 73 percent of the population believes the fresh elections are necessary . dw staff / afp -lrb- win / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .

it could also deal a blow to chancellor gerhard schröder just weeks before he faces voters at a general election , in which economic anxieties are expected to play a key role . the key business climate index compiled monthly by the ifo economic research institute edged lower to 94.6 points in august from 95.0 in july , it said in a statement . " companies are a little disturbed ahead of the election , " ifo said . the figure fell below analysts ' consensus forecast of a slight rise to 95.2 points , helping send stocks lower in frankfurt .
the dax 30 index was down 1.15 percent at 4,859.60 points in midday trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. hans-werner sinn , ifo institute " all in all , the results are not an obstacle to a modest upward trend in the next few months , " ifo president hans-werner sinn nonetheless said in a statement , noting that the fall was slightly more pronounced in eastern germany . independent analysts appeared to agree with sinn 's assessment . " today 's figures do not amount to a major disappointment , " said sylvain broyer of banking services group cdc ixis .
" we see the decline in the ifo number in august as a simple correction after a strong gain . " " this is a disappointment .
it shows that rome was n't built in a day , " ralph solveen of commerzbank told reuters .
" people have frequently heralded growth , but we remain skeptical .
however , the second half of 2005 will be better than the first . " the ifo index had posted a marked rise in july to 95 from 93.3 in june . added jan-eric fillieule of ccf : " disappointment should be tempered , just as excessive optimism should . " good signs ahead ccf analysts pointed to " encouraging signs of recovery " in germany , notably in the areas of exports and business investment . ifo chief economist gernot nerb said oil prices and uncertainty over the general election , scheduled for sept .

it could also deal a blow to chancellor gerhard schröder just weeks before he faces voters at a general election , in which economic anxieties are expected to play a key role . the key business climate index compiled monthly by the ifo economic research institute edged lower to 94.6 points in august from 95.0 in july , it said in a statement . " companies are a little disturbed ahead of the election , " ifo said . the figure fell below analysts ' consensus forecast of a slight rise to 95.2 points , helping send stocks lower in frankfurt .

" today 's figures do not amount to a major disappointment , " said sylvain broyer of banking services group cdc ixis .
" we see the decline in the ifo number in august as a simple correction after a strong gain . " " this is a disappointment .
it shows that rome was n't built in a day , " ralph solveen of commerzbank told reuters .
" people have frequently heralded growth , but we remain skeptical .
however , the second half of 2005 will be better than the first . " the ifo index had posted a marked rise in july to 95 from 93.3 in june . added jan-eric fillieule of ccf : " disappointment should be tempered , just as excessive optimism should . " good signs ahead ccf analysts pointed to " encouraging signs of recovery " in germany , notably in the areas of exports and business investment . ifo chief economist gernot nerb said oil prices and uncertainty over the general election , scheduled for sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 germany to reform pre-school education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say kindergarten kids should be doing more than coloring a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany . in recent years , there 's been a growing realization in germany that kindergarten is n't just a place for children to romp and play , but also where they begin to learn the ropes of reading , writing and arithmetic - skills that are usually associated with school-age kids .
a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .
even in hungary and norway , the curriculum for kindergartens invites children and parents to choose between specializing in different topics , with the emphasis being on music , playing instruments and reading notes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin schools on a learning curve as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 full steam ahead for election campaigns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder feels the court decision has given him backing in his quest the decision to allow early elections in germany has been interpreted as support by gerhard schröder , who said he can now pursue his new mandate .
his opponents also seem to be relishing the now official contest . germany 's highest court has ruled that next month 's parliamentary election in germany can go ahead , dismissing a claim that the path chosen by chancellor gerhard schröder to bring about the early vote was unconstitutional . schröder now considers himself to have the full backing of the constitutional court and hopes for fresh tailwind in his bid for re-election . " it is now clear that voters will be electing a new parliament on sept .
18 , " schröder said .
" this has been my prime intention , because i 'm seeking a new mandate for my reform policy - a policy which will make germany strong again without threatening social cohesion . " schröder asked for the general election to be brought forward 12 months after a crushing defeat in the key regional election in the former social democrat stronghold of north-rhine westphalia in may that has shaken his authority . he paved the way for it by deliberately losing a vote of confidence in parliament .
but rebels in his red-green alliance challenged the move arguing the vote was engineered , and infringed on their rights as mps . " a defeat for parliame n tary democracy " werner schulz from the green party was one of those who challenged the chancellor 's tactics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner schulz " this is not my personal defeat ; it 's a defeat for parliamentary democracy in germany , " schulz said .
" what 's been strengthened by this ruling is the role of the chancellor in the system .
so in future every time a chancellor suspects , assumes or even thinks to assume that he has no majority anymore , he is allowed to send home the entire parliament . " but the decision stands and germany will go to the polls on sept .

the new party , the successor to the east german communist party , is pinning all its hopes for the coming election on the 57-year-old berliner . although there are those who criticize the party 's new course , not even the critics contest that without gysi the left party / pds would not have gotten anywhere near as much media attention as it has since its inception in late spring . thanks to gysi 's involvement , the party 's prospects for the upcoming parliamentary elections are vastly improved .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the communist party in former east germany , had established itself as a major party at state level in eastern germany during the 1990s .
however in the 2002 parliamentary elections , following gysi 's temporary withdrawal from politics due to an air-miles scandal , it fell short of the 5 percent threshold necessary for inclusion in the federal parliament . his return to politics late last year was warmly welcomed by party rank and file .
but still gysi delayed his comeback for health reasons . at home o n the political stage now back in politics , gysi has not lost his charm , and he 's just as much in demand on german talk shows as ever before .
owing to his finely-honed rhetoric , he has been able to win affection in western germany , where other pds members have failed . his charisma will serve him well in the alliance with former spd chief oskar lafontaine .
opinion polls show that the two will win far more votes as allies than they would do individually . bildunterschrift : gysi and his politica ally , oskar lafontaine breaki n g from the past changing perceptions of east germany remains a priority for gysi . " we need to learn to see east germany as an opportunity for our nation , " he said .
" that means a change of mentality , a cultural change , and also a change in the media .
we need a new zeitgeist . " germans should not denounce everything associated with the former east germany , he argues . but gysi 's own past has come back to haunt him on several occasions .
he was responsible for the transition of the former communist party into the pds in 1990 .
for a number of years thereafter he had to fight accusations that he had worked for the stasi , the east german secret police . some accuse gysi of backing out of politics in 2002 when things turned tough for him .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .

a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .
in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .
but the result is very significant . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amos oz : " activism is a way of life " amos oz is one of israel 's most famous authors and peace activists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.08.2005 germany to reform pre-school education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say kindergarten kids should be doing more than coloring a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany . in recent years , there 's been a growing realization in germany that kindergarten is n't just a place for children to romp and play , but also where they begin to learn the ropes of reading , writing and arithmetic - skills that are usually associated with school-age kids .
a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .
germany lags behind in european comparison even as politicians fail to resolve the problem , a look at other european nations shows that germany is already a laggard in the field - a fact that explains its disastrous performance on the pisa test .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at " nursery schools " in britain and " ecoles maternelles " in france are already groomed playfully in dealing with numbers and the alphabet , while belgium , italy and holland have clearly defined what children should be able to do at the end of their pre-school period - count and even read .
even in hungary and norway , the curriculum for kindergartens invites children and parents to choose between specializing in different topics , with the emphasis being on music , playing instruments and reading notes . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin schools on a learning curve as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual .

oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .
the gaza withdrawal took place surprisi n gly easy .
everyo n e is looki n g at the west ba n k n ow .
what do you expect ?
also a withdrawal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip on monday .
this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .
there is no question of the israelis unilaterally and without a palestinian reciprocity simply deciding to move out of the west bank . do you thi n k ariel sharo n 's reversal i n regards of the withdrawal is trustworthy ? you know , if it comes to politicians my question is not : " is it trustworthy ? " but " is it genuine ? "
he has proven as far as gaza is concerned that he is willing to risk his political career .
this is serious , this is not playing games .
this is not public relations .
now what happens in the depth of his psyche and his mind and in his conscience , i do not know .
i have never met him personally .
i do n't know how deep and genuine the change is .

this questions depends very much on the palestinian response .
if the palestinians respond to the israeli unilateral withdrawal from gaza with more violence and more terrorism there will be no withdrawal from the west bank .
if , on the other hand , there will be a parallel peace gesture or peace movement on the side of the palestinians , there is a good chance that eventually there will be an agreement over the west bank as well .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities . born in jerusalem in 1939 , amos oz is one of the most famous israeli writers .
he has already received the peace prize of the german book traders ' association and the 1998 israel prize .
oz supports the israeli-palestinian peace process and is a co-founder of shalom achshav -lrb- peace now -rrb- , israel 's largest extra-parliamentary movement and the country 's oldest peace movement .
he will receive the goethe prize of the city of frankfurt on sunday . dw-world : first of all , mr. oz , co n gratulatio n s o n receivi n g the goethe prize of the city of fra n kfurt .
you are receivi n g it for your literary work , but also especially for your political activities .
what does the prize mea n perso n ally for you ? amos oz : thank you for your congratulations .
the prize personally means for me an intensification of my personal dialogue with european and german culture - and of my family 's own attachment to goethe in particular , and to german and european culture in general . what do you mea n by your family 's attachme n t to goethe ? both my parents read german and in fact they could speak german .
now my elder daughter , who is a scholar , speaks german .
i belong to the lost generation in between .
i can not speak any german .
but for many years my parents and grandparents were attracted to german culture and to german heritage and before the rise of the nazis they often regarded germany as their kind of spiritual and intellectual promised land .
of course this was a one-sided love .
and throughout my childhood and boyhood i knew that my parents were heartbroken about the fact that they loved germany and were not loved back by it . the prize certificate puts you i n to the traditio n of joha n n wolfga n g vo n goethe .
what does it mea n for israeli-germa n relatio n s i n the cultural sector that a n israeli is getti n g that prize ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think it is an intensification - or a part of the intensification of the relationship .
this relationship had been very badly injured during the nazi period and it took decades to recover .
and it recovered particularly through literary dialogue .
i think it was the fact that israeli literature is extensively read in germany .
and postwar german literature was extensively and eagerly read by many israelis .
that provided for the resumption and identification of the israeli-german dialogue .
it is difficult for me to speak in terms of climaxes .
but awarding the goethe prize to an israeli novelist is a very striking manifestation of the intensity of the literary and spiritual dialogue between the two cultures . what is comi n g n ext ? i think it is very urgent to prepare a new generation of translators of hebrew into german and of german into hebrew .
the older generation is naturally disappearing .
israelis who were educated in germany before world war ii are now fewer and fewer .
i think there should be an academic university program of training translators in order to make this literary conversation continue and even broaden and deeper . would you give some i n put o n such a program ? well , i could give a guest lecture on the philosophical and artistic significance of translation .
but of course i could not tell anyone how to translate - not knowing a word of german .
we need people who have translated before and who have experiences in translation and speak both languages . of course your literary work ca n n ot be completely separated from your political work .
but do they have the same ambitio n ?
do you believe that your books have political i n flue n ce ? this is the hardest question of all because there is no way of actually measuring the influence of a book , a novel or a book of poetry on the reader .
we will never know .
perhaps the reader himself can not say to what an extent his or her reading shaped his or her political views .
i hope it has a certain impact but i will never know .
even if it 's scientifically proved to me that my work has no influence at all , i will still do it .
that 's the only thing i can do .
that is true for both my literary work and my political work .
i can not measure it or provide any evidence that this influence exists .
there are no people who approach me and say , " oh , mr. oz , i just read your book and i am born again .
my eyes are open to see the light . "
it does not very often happen that way .
but i think that maybe literary work and political work eventually somehow helps people to get rid of certain simplifications and stereotypes . i would like to ask you also about your opi n io n about the gaza withdrawal .

a slew of international studies have made it clear that the early childhood years are optimal for kids to learn basic skills thanks to their inherent curiosity and help them perform better when they enter primary schools at the age of six .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's little wonder then that the new children and youth report issued by the german government on thursday recommends allowing kids as young as two to enter kindergarten , and changing the way kindergartens and schools are traditionally viewed in germany .
" in future schools must provide for more supervision and upbringing , while kindergartens and day-care centers should increase their focus on education , " thomas rauschenbach , director of the german youth institute -lrb- dij -rrb- and head of the seven-member commission that drew up the report for the german government told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" all children profit from it by the time they complete two years , " rauschenbach added .
teacher training the weak link growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education has in turn focused attention on the role of kindergarten teachers - and revealed it to be the weak link in germany 's education system .
that 's because , unlike in most other eu countries , kindergarten teachers in germany only need to complete a three-year training program to work as an early child educator , and not the full post-secondary education required from primary school teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics point out that the lack of sufficient training leaves kindergarten teachers unequipped to provide children with intellectually-stimulating games and basic playful lessons in natural science , mathematics and reading .
" the teachers at our kindergartens still see themselves first and foremost as babysitters , " one frankfurt mother recently told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
the latest children and youth report recommends training kindergarten teachers to university level to ensure better preparation for their twin roles of educators and supervisors .
no solutions in sight the training of kindergarten teachers has been a subject of debate and criticism for several years in germany with several experts , social scientists and even the green party and the teachers ' union pushing to raise the qualification barriers for hiring new teachers .
there are signs that things are gradually changing thanks to a few initiatives by some universities to offer new specialized study courses on " pre-school education training " that trains teachers to work with children right from birth until the age of six .
but there are n't many takers because the courses are rarely state-funded and thus cost money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is further complicated by the fact that matters of education in germany are regulated at state level with different states sometimes pursuing conflicting policies .
education ministers from the 16 federal states did agree on a common framework last year to improve the education levels of kindergarten teachers in order to better promote young children , but so far nothing concrete has come of it .

the new party , the successor to the east german communist party , is pinning all its hopes for the coming election on the 57-year-old berliner . although there are those who criticize the party 's new course , not even the critics contest that without gysi the left party / pds would not have gotten anywhere near as much media attention as it has since its inception in late spring . thanks to gysi 's involvement , the party 's prospects for the upcoming parliamentary elections are vastly improved .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the communist party in former east germany , had established itself as a major party at state level in eastern germany during the 1990s .
however in the 2002 parliamentary elections , following gysi 's temporary withdrawal from politics due to an air-miles scandal , it fell short of the 5 percent threshold necessary for inclusion in the federal parliament . his return to politics late last year was warmly welcomed by party rank and file .
but still gysi delayed his comeback for health reasons . at home o n the political stage now back in politics , gysi has not lost his charm , and he 's just as much in demand on german talk shows as ever before .
owing to his finely-honed rhetoric , he has been able to win affection in western germany , where other pds members have failed . his charisma will serve him well in the alliance with former spd chief oskar lafontaine .
opinion polls show that the two will win far more votes as allies than they would do individually . bildunterschrift : gysi and his politica ally , oskar lafontaine breaki n g from the past changing perceptions of east germany remains a priority for gysi . " we need to learn to see east germany as an opportunity for our nation , " he said .
" that means a change of mentality , a cultural change , and also a change in the media .
we need a new zeitgeist . " germans should not denounce everything associated with the former east germany , he argues . but gysi 's own past has come back to haunt him on several occasions .
he was responsible for the transition of the former communist party into the pds in 1990 .
for a number of years thereafter he had to fight accusations that he had worked for the stasi , the east german secret police . some accuse gysi of backing out of politics in 2002 when things turned tough for him .
gysi rebukes such claims . " i went through a lot during my time in parliament : 11 years and countless attempts to get rid of me , " he argues .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .
the european commission has repeatedly said that the benes decrees are in line with eu legislation . preside n t war n s resolutio n 's effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus czech president vaclav klaus , a vociferous opponent of any concessions , called the resolution " a conceptually wrong , useless and empty gesture , which can hurt the czech republic and its interests . " many czech politicians have expressed concerns that rendering the decrees invalid could prompt a wave of lawsuits and property claims .
paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

" the government of the czech republic expresses deep recognition to all people from among the former czechoslovak citizens , mainly those of german origin , who lived on the territory of the current czech republic before world war ii , who remained loyal to the czechoslovak republic and actively participated in fighting for its liberation or suffered under the nazi terror , " the statement from prague read . about 3.5 million ethnic germans were deported from the border regions of czechoslovakia after the war and about 200,000 temporarily lost czechoslovak citizenship . be n es decrees led to expulsio n s a n d co n fiscatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evard benes decrees issued by edvard benes , the czechoslovak president in1945 , allowed the expulsion of ethnic germans and hungarians and the confiscation of their property .
in 1946 , further legislation was passed that exempted those who had committed crimes against the two minorities from prosecution . the benes decrees also stated that ethnic germans who fought against fascism could stay in the country .
czech ministers admitted on wednesday that some were expelled by mistake and that those allowed to stay were ethnically discriminated against . " we are correcting an injustice committed against our german co-citizens , " czech prime minister jiri paroubek said .
the apology is for " the opponents of nazism who were affected by measures taken by former czechoslovakia against its so-called enemy citizens after wwii . " " we are documenting that the benes decrees did not refer to anti-fascists , " paroubek continued .
" we are expressing our admiration , appreciation and apology to the significant minority of those czechoslovak citizens of german descent , " who " had remained faithful . " several german , austrian and hungarian politicians have maintained that the benes decrees were discriminatory and should n't still be considered valid by a european union member .
the european commission has repeatedly said that the benes decrees are in line with eu legislation . preside n t war n s resolutio n 's effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus czech president vaclav klaus , a vociferous opponent of any concessions , called the resolution " a conceptually wrong , useless and empty gesture , which can hurt the czech republic and its interests . " many czech politicians have expressed concerns that rendering the decrees invalid could prompt a wave of lawsuits and property claims .
paroubek has rejected such speculation . the czech government also announced that it would be donating 30 million koruna -lrb- 1.01 million euros , $ 1.2 million -rrb- to a foundation that will help locate anti-nazi ethnic germans and record their personal histories . czech foreign minister cyril svoboda revealed that the government would be calling on those directly affected or their relatives to come forward . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs honor massacred sudeten germans a memorial plaque was unveiled sunday in the czech town of usti nad labem for the 50 germans civilians massacred shortly after the end of world war ii .

it could also deal a blow to chancellor gerhard schröder just weeks before he faces voters at a general election , in which economic anxieties are expected to play a key role . the key business climate index compiled monthly by the ifo economic research institute edged lower to 94.6 points in august from 95.0 in july , it said in a statement . " companies are a little disturbed ahead of the election , " ifo said . the figure fell below analysts ' consensus forecast of a slight rise to 95.2 points , helping send stocks lower in frankfurt .
the dax 30 index was down 1.15 percent at 4,859.60 points in midday trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. hans-werner sinn , ifo institute " all in all , the results are not an obstacle to a modest upward trend in the next few months , " ifo president hans-werner sinn nonetheless said in a statement , noting that the fall was slightly more pronounced in eastern germany . independent analysts appeared to agree with sinn 's assessment . " today 's figures do not amount to a major disappointment , " said sylvain broyer of banking services group cdc ixis .
" we see the decline in the ifo number in august as a simple correction after a strong gain . " " this is a disappointment .
it shows that rome was n't built in a day , " ralph solveen of commerzbank told reuters .
" people have frequently heralded growth , but we remain skeptical .
however , the second half of 2005 will be better than the first . " the ifo index had posted a marked rise in july to 95 from 93.3 in june . added jan-eric fillieule of ccf : " disappointment should be tempered , just as excessive optimism should . " good signs ahead ccf analysts pointed to " encouraging signs of recovery " in germany , notably in the areas of exports and business investment . ifo chief economist gernot nerb said oil prices and uncertainty over the general election , scheduled for sept .
18 , had weighed on business sentiment this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on wednesday , the price of oil hit a record 68.00 dollars per barrel in new york before easing to 67.50 dollars in electronic trade early thursday . for its survey , ifo polls around 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months . in july , it appeared that germany was pulling out of a slump , with two straight months of increases on the ifo index that the institute had chalked up in part to the euro 's fall against the dollar which provided a boost to the country 's export-led economy . prospect of new government spurs hopes the chances of a conservative win in the legislative poll had also fueled optimism among business leaders in july , before two deputies raised a legal challenge to the vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal constitutional court on thursday however , germany 's highest court removed the final hurdle to the sept .
18 vote .
the federal constitutional court ruled seven-to-one to reject complaints by two lawmakers who had argued that chancellor gerhard schröder 's deliberate loss of a parliamentary no-confidence to bring the poll forward by a year had violated germany 's basic law . conservative challenger angela merkel has said that if her christian union bloc is victorious it will focus on cutting unemployment which reached five million earlier this year , the highest level since world war ii . schröder sought new elections saying he could not continue implementing painful labor market reforms without a fresh pledge of support from the german people . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economy set to dominate german election now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits .

cerys rees from llandysul , will receive more than £ 2,000 a year when she starts dental school in cardiff next month .
but it is on condition she returns to work in ceredigion for at least five years after her five-year training .
a lack of nhs dentists in rural part of wales has seen long queues of patients with others living near the border being allowed to sign up in england .
earlier this month , hundreds of people queued from early in the morning outside a dentist in denbighshire , after it opened for new registrations for just one day .
similar scenes have been played out in machynlleth and carmarthen where , in 2003 , 600 people queued to take up nhs places on offer at a new practice in the town .
scenes of hundreds queuing outside surgeries are no uncommon in ceredigion , the local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- said last year that a lack of dentists would be exacerbated because 44 % of current practitioners were due to retire in the next 10 years .
miss rees said the money from ceredigion lhb - funding three students per year for the duration of their training course - would be a " great help " as fees for her course at cardiff university 's dental school amount to £ 30,000 .
mary griffiths , chair of ceredigion lhb , said : " the dental bursary scheme has been developed by the lhb to provide extra financial assistance for our young students .
" it is extremely important to support and help young people from the area whenever we can .
i am very pleased for cerys and i look forward to seeing her in her own practice when she qualifies . "
personal dental schemes conwy local health board runs a similar bursary scheme in north wales .
according to the british dental association 's national director in wales , stuart geddes , salaries for dental practitioners in wales were already about £ 2,500 higher than those in england .
those who train them receive about £ 1,500 more than those in england , he said .
in april , the welsh assembly government announced an extra £ 5m aimed at keeping dentists in the nhs .
the money was to pay for " personal dental schemes , " which would allow dentists and local health boards to introduce local contract arrangements .

pre-tax profits at the firm surged to £ 435m -lrb- $ 785m -rrb- for the first six months of the year , compared to £ 156m at the same time last year .
at least 35 % of the improvement was a result of its " restoring success " shake-up , corus said .
but looking ahead , corus warned lower prices and high stock levels would only improve gradually as the year went on .
steelmakers are being gradually squeezed by rising iron ore and coal prices which are eating into their margins .
price fall offset " the third quarter will be impacted by lower selling prices , the full effect of raw material cost increases and reduced steel making to align production with demand , " corus said in a statement .
the company revealed that deliveries had fallen by 8 % during the first half of the year .
however , a rise in steel prices had helped offset the fall in deliveries , pushing turnover 19 % higher to £ 5.33bn.
the surge in profits underlines a turnaround at the company which restructured its operations in the uk in recent years , reducing its workforce and boosting its productivity .
the company only managed to move back into the black a year ago .
but its renaissance has come at a price : more than 13,000 jobs have been axed across its operations - which include plants in port talbot , scunthorpe and rotherham - since 1999 .

pre-tax profits at the firm surged to £ 435m -lrb- $ 785m -rrb- for the first six months of the year , compared to £ 156m at the same time last year .

the company revealed that deliveries had fallen by 8 % during the first half of the year .
however , a rise in steel prices had helped offset the fall in deliveries , pushing turnover 19 % higher to £ 5.33bn.
the surge in profits underlines a turnaround at the company which restructured its operations in the uk in recent years , reducing its workforce and boosting its productivity .
the company only managed to move back into the black a year ago .

the group revealed that pre-tax profits before one-offs for the six months to 30 june fell 20 % to £ 135.4m compared to the same period last year .
the company also hinted that it was not interested in any takeover approaches .
earlier in the week , businessman gerry robinson had hinted he was planning to make an offer to the firm .
the firm , known for its pest control business , has suffered in recent years - losing both its chairman and chief executive in 2004 following poor results and a profit warning .

the overall pass rate rose from 97.6 % of the exam entries to 97.8 % .
and 61.2 % were awarded the higher grades , a * to c , up two whole percentage points on last year - the biggest rise since 1992 .
but concern has been expressed about the decline in entries for modern languages , and whether gcse students have essential basic skills .
' pressure ' the council , the umbrella body for the main seven exam boards , said the decline in modern languages - which had been predicted - was " much to be regretted " .
full course gcse results entries : 5.74 million -lrb- down 2.4 % -rrb- pass rate : 97.8 % -lrb- up 0.2 -rrb- a * -c grades : 61.2 % -lrb- up 2 -rrb- a * / a grades : 18.4 % -lrb- up 1 -rrb- a * grades : 5.9 % -lrb- up 0.3 -rrb- john dunford of the secondary heads association called for an urgent government review .
experts suggested the pattern of higher grades and lower entries was accounted for by weaker students switching out of languages and also the double science gcse .
as usual , overall , girls outperformed boys and students in northern ireland achieved higher grades than those elsewhere .
gcse grades a * -c england : 60.8 % northern ireland : 71 % wales : 61.3 % all boys : 57 % all girls : 65.2 % vocational gnvqs as a whole attracted 4.2 % more entries even though they are being phased out .
pass rates were up from 76.2 % in 2004 to 79 % .
they are being replaced with various qualifications , including new applied gcses which attracted almost 40,000 more entries this year , a third more than last year .
the pass rate was 93.1 % and 39 % got grade cs or above .
' focus on basics ' the institute of directors said its members were " crying out for improvement " in basic skills .
yes there 's more that we need to do .
we 're already working on it with employers jacqui smith schools minister its head of business policy , richard wilson , said : " the starting point for employers recruiting staff is surely to have access to candidates with basic literacy and numeracy skills .
" if individuals lack these skills , workplace training and development or progression into further and higher education becomes much more difficult . "
and the man who headed the government 's inquiry into 14 to 19 learning in england , sir mike tomlinson , said gcses were " failing a generation " on the basics .
new gcses schools minister jacqui smith said : " we are reforming the gcses and in the future we will be judging schools on the extent to which pupils are getting not just five good gcses but five good gcses including english and maths .
" so yes there 's more that we need to do .
we 're already working on it with employers . "
have your say they are the nearest thing to an objective measure that parents have ken ricketts , wokingham send us your comments the reforms involve revamping english and maths to ensure higher grades do involve functional skills .
the government 's white paper said it would be 2008 before the revised english gcse was available for teaching , with maths a year later .
chris keates of the nasuwt teachers ' union said business leaders were " practised serial detractors " .
last year gcse performance seemed to have levelled off the results relate to the performance of exam entries , not candidates .
first statistics on candidates ' performances - such as how many got at least five good gcses - are due in october .
the improvements in exam grades will not necessarily mean they have done better .
in 2003 , for example , more gcse exam entries were awarded grades a * to c , but the proportion of students in england achieving at least five of them fell - for the first time since the qualification 's introduction .

the response of leading political parties and thinkers in indonesia has been to propose a policy of ethical islam , dissociated from politics , and to advocate that solutions to problems in society can not exclusively be found in islam .

the most significant clash over religious principles came when conservatives tried to get a clause outlawing adultery included in the new penal code .
