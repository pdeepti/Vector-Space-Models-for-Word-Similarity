" it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .
the country insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas - a vital source of hard currency . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure off in eu-iran nuke showdown an expected showdown in iran-eu nuclear talks friday in london should be more sound than fury as both sides feel the negotiations are basically on hold until after iranian presidential elections in june , diplomats said .

" hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
i saw that with my own eyes , " misch told afp from his home in the german capital .
" but we had been expecting it .
it did n't come out of the blue .
we had been waiting for the end . " on april 30 , 1945 , with soviet forces just 300 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from the bunker and his armies beaten , hitler bade farewell to his staff and went into his private rooms .
there , the man who had plunged the world into conflict and sent millions of jews to their deaths in the holocaust poisoned a willing braun and shot himself in the head .
historians believe their bodies were then soaked with fuel and burned . " my work room was opposite the entrance to hitler 's rooms , " recalled misch , who was a 28-year-old staff sergeant in the nazi ss with responsibility for maintaining the telephone lines in the bunker .
hitler 's suicide no surprise " i remember that he said goodbye in the corridor and went into the rooms .
he said he did n't want to be disturbed .
i do n't know how long it took , maybe one hour , maybe two .
i did n't hear the shots myself because i was working on the telephones .
but then i heard someone shout ' linge , linge , i think it has happened . '
-lrb- heinz linge was hitler 's servant -rrb- .
we waited maybe 20 minutes .
then we opened the door to his office and the one to the living room .
hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
it was n't a surprise .
the commanders had all wanted to evacuate hitler , but he said no , he was staying in berlin . " nine days later germany surrendered and the guns of world war ii fell quiet in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the downfall " with juliane köhler -lrb- eva braun -rrb- , bruno ganz -lrb- adolf hitler -rrb- and heino ferch -lrb- albert speer -rrb- hitler 's final days were portrayed in great detail in " the downfall , " a big-budget german film which came out in germany last september and has been a success worldwide .
but despite having cooperated with the director oliver hirschbiegel on the making of the film , misch now says it was riddled with inaccuracies .
not like in the movies " it was just operetta , dramatic operetta .
that is how the americans wanted the death of hitler to look , " misch said .
he said one of the biggest mistakes in reconstructions of the suicide is to show hitler 's bunker as a giant complex of rooms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing in this parking lot in central berlin recalls the bunker , once underneath , where hitler and eva braun committed suicide " people confuse the führer 's bunker with the upper bunker or the bunker at the reichs chancellery .
in fact the bunker we were in was so small .
we were not a whole company , there were just five people .
only five of us could have witnessed the death , no more . " the site stands today a few hundred meters from the glitzy shopping center and office complex which now fills potsdamer platz in central berlin .
there is no plaque to mark the location . on may 10 , a national monument to the victims of the holocaust will open just a few steps from the spot where hitler ended his life . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

" it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .

in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "

mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.04.2005 iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision by iran couls come next week , according to rowhani iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday . " it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .

" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .
the country insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas - a vital source of hard currency . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure off in eu-iran nuke showdown an expected showdown in iran-eu nuclear talks friday in london should be more sound than fury as both sides feel the negotiations are basically on hold until after iranian presidential elections in june , diplomats said .

" it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .
the country insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas - a vital source of hard currency . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure off in eu-iran nuke showdown an expected showdown in iran-eu nuclear talks friday in london should be more sound than fury as both sides feel the negotiations are basically on hold until after iranian presidential elections in june , diplomats said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.04.2005 a close look at surveillance in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urban eye project investigates european surveillance standards a group of political scientists , criminologists and technicians have joined forces for the european research project urban eye , an investigation into the social effects and political consequences of video surveillance . for many years , security cameras have been a part of every day life in europe - in shopping centers , at cash dispensers and in airports .
germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .
and that is where the political scientists , criminologists and technicians from the european research project urban eye come in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the vatican uses video surveillance the urban eye is a comparative research project analyzing the employment of cctv -lrb- close circuit television -rrb- in public accessible space in europe .
it intends to assess its social effects - in terms of changes in criminal and every-day behavior - and political impacts regarding law enforcement , civil rights and the character of public space in order to finally outline strategies for its regulation . britain 's bulger case launches cctv nationwide video surveillance was thrust to the fore of the public consciousness in britain in 1993 when cameras in a liverpool shopping center caught the moment when two11-year-old boys , jon venables and robert thompson , kidnapped two-year-old jamie bulger . the cameras did not prevent the subsequent murder of bulger but the tapes did lead to the conviction of the killers and the decision by the british government to invest two million pounds -lrb- 2.9 million euros , $ 3.8 million -rrb- in a nationwide system .
in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .
in england and wales , nearly 29,000 fewer people were admitted to hospital with assault related injuries in the last five years . german pilot project raises concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching over an underground mall in stuttgart in an example of where countries differ , germany has very different regulations .
for video surveillance to be approved in public spaces , the state laws need to be changed .
a pilot project in regensburg is under way where the local police in the bavarian town have created a law under which video surveillance is allowed . however , the pilot project raises some concerns surrounding the positioning of cameras in private spaces and the effect the cameras have on the reduction of crime . surveillance open to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping an eye on dresden 's train station the researchers at urban eye are concerned that there are too many gray areas in the use of video surveillance regarding effectiveness in the reduction of crime and the possible infringements of civil rights .
a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .
" and they came to the conclusion that it was mainly young black males .
in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives . " these are the questions that urban eye wants to answer as well as those regarding the effectiveness and lawful basis of cctv systems across european countries . " our recommendation would be that quality standards should be evaluated , effectiveness proven and that systems work within a lawful basis and with licenses , " hempel said .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .

in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .

a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .

in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives .

" hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
i saw that with my own eyes , " misch told afp from his home in the german capital .
" but we had been expecting it .
it did n't come out of the blue .
we had been waiting for the end . " on april 30 , 1945 , with soviet forces just 300 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from the bunker and his armies beaten , hitler bade farewell to his staff and went into his private rooms .
there , the man who had plunged the world into conflict and sent millions of jews to their deaths in the holocaust poisoned a willing braun and shot himself in the head .
historians believe their bodies were then soaked with fuel and burned . " my work room was opposite the entrance to hitler 's rooms , " recalled misch , who was a 28-year-old staff sergeant in the nazi ss with responsibility for maintaining the telephone lines in the bunker .
hitler 's suicide no surprise " i remember that he said goodbye in the corridor and went into the rooms .
he said he did n't want to be disturbed .
i do n't know how long it took , maybe one hour , maybe two .
i did n't hear the shots myself because i was working on the telephones .
but then i heard someone shout ' linge , linge , i think it has happened . '
-lrb- heinz linge was hitler 's servant -rrb- .
we waited maybe 20 minutes .
then we opened the door to his office and the one to the living room .
hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
it was n't a surprise .
the commanders had all wanted to evacuate hitler , but he said no , he was staying in berlin . " nine days later germany surrendered and the guns of world war ii fell quiet in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the downfall " with juliane köhler -lrb- eva braun -rrb- , bruno ganz -lrb- adolf hitler -rrb- and heino ferch -lrb- albert speer -rrb- hitler 's final days were portrayed in great detail in " the downfall , " a big-budget german film which came out in germany last september and has been a success worldwide .
but despite having cooperated with the director oliver hirschbiegel on the making of the film , misch now says it was riddled with inaccuracies .
not like in the movies " it was just operetta , dramatic operetta .
that is how the americans wanted the death of hitler to look , " misch said .
he said one of the biggest mistakes in reconstructions of the suicide is to show hitler 's bunker as a giant complex of rooms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing in this parking lot in central berlin recalls the bunker , once underneath , where hitler and eva braun committed suicide " people confuse the führer 's bunker with the upper bunker or the bunker at the reichs chancellery .
in fact the bunker we were in was so small .
we were not a whole company , there were just five people .
only five of us could have witnessed the death , no more . " the site stands today a few hundred meters from the glitzy shopping center and office complex which now fills potsdamer platz in central berlin .
there is no plaque to mark the location . on may 10 , a national monument to the victims of the holocaust will open just a few steps from the spot where hitler ended his life . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .
and that is where the political scientists , criminologists and technicians from the european research project urban eye come in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the vatican uses video surveillance the urban eye is a comparative research project analyzing the employment of cctv -lrb- close circuit television -rrb- in public accessible space in europe .
it intends to assess its social effects - in terms of changes in criminal and every-day behavior - and political impacts regarding law enforcement , civil rights and the character of public space in order to finally outline strategies for its regulation . britain 's bulger case launches cctv nationwide video surveillance was thrust to the fore of the public consciousness in britain in 1993 when cameras in a liverpool shopping center caught the moment when two11-year-old boys , jon venables and robert thompson , kidnapped two-year-old jamie bulger . the cameras did not prevent the subsequent murder of bulger but the tapes did lead to the conviction of the killers and the decision by the british government to invest two million pounds -lrb- 2.9 million euros , $ 3.8 million -rrb- in a nationwide system .
in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .

for video surveillance to be approved in public spaces , the state laws need to be changed .
a pilot project in regensburg is under way where the local police in the bavarian town have created a law under which video surveillance is allowed . however , the pilot project raises some concerns surrounding the positioning of cameras in private spaces and the effect the cameras have on the reduction of crime . surveillance open to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping an eye on dresden 's train station the researchers at urban eye are concerned that there are too many gray areas in the use of video surveillance regarding effectiveness in the reduction of crime and the possible infringements of civil rights .
a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .
" and they came to the conclusion that it was mainly young black males .
in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives . " these are the questions that urban eye wants to answer as well as those regarding the effectiveness and lawful basis of cctv systems across european countries . " our recommendation would be that quality standards should be evaluated , effectiveness proven and that systems work within a lawful basis and with licenses , " hempel said .

it did n't come out of the blue .
we had been waiting for the end . " on april 30 , 1945 , with soviet forces just 300 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from the bunker and his armies beaten , hitler bade farewell to his staff and went into his private rooms .

historians believe their bodies were then soaked with fuel and burned . " my work room was opposite the entrance to hitler 's rooms , " recalled misch , who was a 28-year-old staff sergeant in the nazi ss with responsibility for maintaining the telephone lines in the bunker .

not like in the movies " it was just operetta , dramatic operetta .
that is how the americans wanted the death of hitler to look , " misch said .
he said one of the biggest mistakes in reconstructions of the suicide is to show hitler 's bunker as a giant complex of rooms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing in this parking lot in central berlin recalls the bunker , once underneath , where hitler and eva braun committed suicide " people confuse the führer 's bunker with the upper bunker or the bunker at the reichs chancellery .

" hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
i saw that with my own eyes , " misch told afp from his home in the german capital .
" but we had been expecting it .
it did n't come out of the blue .
we had been waiting for the end . " on april 30 , 1945 , with soviet forces just 300 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from the bunker and his armies beaten , hitler bade farewell to his staff and went into his private rooms .
there , the man who had plunged the world into conflict and sent millions of jews to their deaths in the holocaust poisoned a willing braun and shot himself in the head .
historians believe their bodies were then soaked with fuel and burned . " my work room was opposite the entrance to hitler 's rooms , " recalled misch , who was a 28-year-old staff sergeant in the nazi ss with responsibility for maintaining the telephone lines in the bunker .
hitler 's suicide no surprise " i remember that he said goodbye in the corridor and went into the rooms .
he said he did n't want to be disturbed .
i do n't know how long it took , maybe one hour , maybe two .
i did n't hear the shots myself because i was working on the telephones .
but then i heard someone shout ' linge , linge , i think it has happened . '
-lrb- heinz linge was hitler 's servant -rrb- .
we waited maybe 20 minutes .
then we opened the door to his office and the one to the living room .
hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
it was n't a surprise .
the commanders had all wanted to evacuate hitler , but he said no , he was staying in berlin . " nine days later germany surrendered and the guns of world war ii fell quiet in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the downfall " with juliane köhler -lrb- eva braun -rrb- , bruno ganz -lrb- adolf hitler -rrb- and heino ferch -lrb- albert speer -rrb- hitler 's final days were portrayed in great detail in " the downfall , " a big-budget german film which came out in germany last september and has been a success worldwide .
but despite having cooperated with the director oliver hirschbiegel on the making of the film , misch now says it was riddled with inaccuracies .
not like in the movies " it was just operetta , dramatic operetta .
that is how the americans wanted the death of hitler to look , " misch said .
he said one of the biggest mistakes in reconstructions of the suicide is to show hitler 's bunker as a giant complex of rooms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing in this parking lot in central berlin recalls the bunker , once underneath , where hitler and eva braun committed suicide " people confuse the führer 's bunker with the upper bunker or the bunker at the reichs chancellery .
in fact the bunker we were in was so small .
we were not a whole company , there were just five people .
only five of us could have witnessed the death , no more . " the site stands today a few hundred meters from the glitzy shopping center and office complex which now fills potsdamer platz in central berlin .
there is no plaque to mark the location . on may 10 , a national monument to the victims of the holocaust will open just a few steps from the spot where hitler ended his life . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .
and that is where the political scientists , criminologists and technicians from the european research project urban eye come in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the vatican uses video surveillance the urban eye is a comparative research project analyzing the employment of cctv -lrb- close circuit television -rrb- in public accessible space in europe .

but another reason for german soccer 's fame is a university coach training program in cologne . long before germany knew it was to host the 2006 world cup , the country had another claim to soccer fame : its world renowned soccer coaching program , now finishing its 50th season . indeed , the german soccer association 's decision just after world war ii to offer a special training program for up-and-coming football coaches turned out to be a shrewd one . the legendary sepp herberger -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who led the german national team to win the world cup in 1954 , was the mastermind of the soccer coach training program . " the soccer coach training program started back in 1947 at our university , " said walter tokarski , director of the german sport university in cologne , adding that all the directors of the program were also successful teachers or even trained here themselves - people like herberger , hennes weisweiler , gero bisanz and now erich rutemöller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a special vision since then , over one thousand students have gained their state-approved degrees as soccer coaches .
while they were originally expected to work in germany , they 've meanwhile become one of the country 's best exports , said gero bisanz , who directed the coach training program for nearly 30 years . " our courses continue to have an excellent international reputation , " bisanz said .
" former soccer players from all five continents and 49 different national associations of the international fifa association have completed their course of studies at our university . " a model program the cologne program has been a model for training courses in japan , malaysia , and iran .
but european countries also work together and recognize each others ' coaching licenses , said erich rutemöller , director of the cologne coach training program . " we have a dutch colleague completing his degree right now , " rutemöller said .
" he first got his coaching licenses in the netherlands , is now getting his training degree here with us and will go on to become a professional coach in the ukraine first division league . " the training program lasts six months and combines coaching and sports theory , sports medicine , and practical experience , including a one-month internship at a german soccer league club .
following two-week long exams , graduates can apply for a license as a soccer trainer with the german soccer association and then coach professionally throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trailblazer women have been attending the soccer coach academy in cologne since 1985 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.04.2005 iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision by iran couls come next week , according to rowhani iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday . " it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .

" it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .

but another reason for german soccer 's fame is a university coach training program in cologne . long before germany knew it was to host the 2006 world cup , the country had another claim to soccer fame : its world renowned soccer coaching program , now finishing its 50th season . indeed , the german soccer association 's decision just after world war ii to offer a special training program for up-and-coming football coaches turned out to be a shrewd one . the legendary sepp herberger -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who led the german national team to win the world cup in 1954 , was the mastermind of the soccer coach training program . " the soccer coach training program started back in 1947 at our university , " said walter tokarski , director of the german sport university in cologne , adding that all the directors of the program were also successful teachers or even trained here themselves - people like herberger , hennes weisweiler , gero bisanz and now erich rutemöller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a special vision since then , over one thousand students have gained their state-approved degrees as soccer coaches .
while they were originally expected to work in germany , they 've meanwhile become one of the country 's best exports , said gero bisanz , who directed the coach training program for nearly 30 years . " our courses continue to have an excellent international reputation , " bisanz said .
" former soccer players from all five continents and 49 different national associations of the international fifa association have completed their course of studies at our university . " a model program the cologne program has been a model for training courses in japan , malaysia , and iran .
but european countries also work together and recognize each others ' coaching licenses , said erich rutemöller , director of the cologne coach training program . " we have a dutch colleague completing his degree right now , " rutemöller said .
" he first got his coaching licenses in the netherlands , is now getting his training degree here with us and will go on to become a professional coach in the ukraine first division league . " the training program lasts six months and combines coaching and sports theory , sports medicine , and practical experience , including a one-month internship at a german soccer league club .
following two-week long exams , graduates can apply for a license as a soccer trainer with the german soccer association and then coach professionally throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trailblazer women have been attending the soccer coach academy in cologne since 1985 .

ballack picked up a pass from makaay before producing a lethal turn and shot to break the deadlock .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.04.2005 iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision by iran couls come next week , according to rowhani iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday . " it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .
the country insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas - a vital source of hard currency . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure off in eu-iran nuke showdown an expected showdown in iran-eu nuclear talks friday in london should be more sound than fury as both sides feel the negotiations are basically on hold until after iranian presidential elections in june , diplomats said .
-lrb- april 29 , 2005 -rrb- what is iran 's nuclear program really for ?
iranian president chatami met with french president chirac tuesday to discuss iran 's nuclear program , among other things .
dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it .
-lrb- april 5 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : carrot and stick for iran while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .

he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .

" hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
i saw that with my own eyes , " misch told afp from his home in the german capital .
" but we had been expecting it .
it did n't come out of the blue .
we had been waiting for the end . " on april 30 , 1945 , with soviet forces just 300 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from the bunker and his armies beaten , hitler bade farewell to his staff and went into his private rooms .
there , the man who had plunged the world into conflict and sent millions of jews to their deaths in the holocaust poisoned a willing braun and shot himself in the head .
historians believe their bodies were then soaked with fuel and burned . " my work room was opposite the entrance to hitler 's rooms , " recalled misch , who was a 28-year-old staff sergeant in the nazi ss with responsibility for maintaining the telephone lines in the bunker .
hitler 's suicide no surprise " i remember that he said goodbye in the corridor and went into the rooms .
he said he did n't want to be disturbed .
i do n't know how long it took , maybe one hour , maybe two .
i did n't hear the shots myself because i was working on the telephones .
but then i heard someone shout ' linge , linge , i think it has happened . '
-lrb- heinz linge was hitler 's servant -rrb- .
we waited maybe 20 minutes .
then we opened the door to his office and the one to the living room .
hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
it was n't a surprise .
the commanders had all wanted to evacuate hitler , but he said no , he was staying in berlin . " nine days later germany surrendered and the guns of world war ii fell quiet in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the downfall " with juliane köhler -lrb- eva braun -rrb- , bruno ganz -lrb- adolf hitler -rrb- and heino ferch -lrb- albert speer -rrb- hitler 's final days were portrayed in great detail in " the downfall , " a big-budget german film which came out in germany last september and has been a success worldwide .
but despite having cooperated with the director oliver hirschbiegel on the making of the film , misch now says it was riddled with inaccuracies .
not like in the movies " it was just operetta , dramatic operetta .
that is how the americans wanted the death of hitler to look , " misch said .
he said one of the biggest mistakes in reconstructions of the suicide is to show hitler 's bunker as a giant complex of rooms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing in this parking lot in central berlin recalls the bunker , once underneath , where hitler and eva braun committed suicide " people confuse the führer 's bunker with the upper bunker or the bunker at the reichs chancellery .
in fact the bunker we were in was so small .
we were not a whole company , there were just five people .
only five of us could have witnessed the death , no more . " the site stands today a few hundred meters from the glitzy shopping center and office complex which now fills potsdamer platz in central berlin .
there is no plaque to mark the location . on may 10 , a national monument to the victims of the holocaust will open just a few steps from the spot where hitler ended his life . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

" we proved today that we are the best team in germany and deserve to win the title , " said ballack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's headcoach felix magath is showered with beer as he and his team celebrate the win of the german championship makaay then stole the show netting a sensational hat-trick to take his season 's tally to 15 and more importantly clinch another bundesliga crown for bayern .
" i came to bayern last season to win the title but it did not happen , " said makaay .
" now i have achieved my goal and scoring three goals is the icing on the cake . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic heaped praise on his boss for stamping his authority on the team after ottmar hitzfeld had lost his magic touch .
" last season under hitzfeld we were pretty bad , but magath came along and changed that , " enthused salihamidzic .
" he had a different approach and must now keep us on the right track . " for felix magath it is a first bundesliga title in his managerial career and he has the chance to do a league and cup double in his debut season with schalke facing bayern in the cup final in berlin on may 28 .
" i am delighted to win the title with bayern , " said magath . " we were constantly informed about the schalke result and when it finished 3-3 we were elated to have won the bundesliga title . " " you can not be fully accepted at a club like bayern unless you win some silverware , " admitted magath .
" it has taken me ten years but now i have won the title and i hope to win a lot more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , a schalke fan , offered his congratulations german chancellor and schalke 04 fan gerhard schröder offered his congratulations to bayern after the 4-0 win at kaiserslautern .
" bayern deserve to be german champions and i offer my congratulations to the team , manager and the fans , " said schröder .
" when it counted bayern were the most consistent team and i wish the club all the best for next season in their new stadium . " the german press heaped praise on coach magath after the title was secured .
" felix magath - welcome to the club of great managers , " the headline ran in the mass-circulation daily bild .
" compared to lattek and hitzfeld , you have work to do .
but make no mistake , the magath era has now begun . "
udo lattek won six domestic titles with bayern while ottmar hitzfeld , magath 's predecessor , won four bundesliga crowns . " magath now accepted after title win , " declared the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung while die welt exclaimed : " teetotaler magath can now enjoy a beer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke , who have been title contenders for most of the season but must now concentrate on securing second place and an automatic champions league spot after surrendering a 3-1 lead against leverkusen , were gracious in conceding the championship . " congratulations to bayern on a 19th title , " acknowledged schalke general manager rudi assauer .
" it is getting a bit boring them winning all the time so we will try to change that next season . " paul freier put leverkusen ahead against schalke on 23 minutes but a crazy first period saw the hosts score three goals in 11 minutes .
brazilian lincoln equalized on the half-hour mark and then shot schalke in front eight minutes later with his second goal of the game .
ebbe sand made it 3-1 in the 41st minute but leverkusen stormed back to take a point . " when you lead 3-1 the game should be wrapped up , " explained schalke manager ralf rangnick .
" it was a great game but i am more concerned about the two lost points . " bulgarian international dimitar berbatov reduced the deficit in the 56th minute and andrei voronin equalized in the 64th minute as schalke collapsed . bayer had roque junior sent off late on , but schalke could not make their numerical advantage count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's coach matthias sammer was not a happy man on saturday schalke are two points clear of vfb stuttgart after matthias sammer 's side fell to a 2-0 reverse at borussia monchengladbach .
portuguese international fernando meira was sent off in the 48th minute receiving a caution for a late tackle and then another booking for throwing the ball away in annoyance .
" our performance today was just rubbish , " raged sammer .
" i think it is best if i do not talk about meira 's sending off . " the win was vital for gladbach who move five points clear of the relegation zone with third from bottom vfl bochum tasting a 6-2 home defeat at the hands of mainz 05 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock 's marcus lantz , left , and berlin 's marcelinho , right , react during rostock 's 2-1 win .
hertha berlin have been the form team in germany of late but with the stakes at their highest the capital side slumped to a 2-1 reverse at lowly hansa rostock .
hertha stay two points behind stuttgart but are joined on 53 points by german champions werder bremen . bremen crushed arminia bielefeld 3-0 to stay in the hunt for a champions league spot and manager thomas schaaf must think his luck is in with schalke , hertha and stuttgart all losing crucial points . sv hamburg also lost ground on bremen falling to a 1-0 defeat at vfl wolfsburg and have just three matches to avoid playing in the much-maligned intertoto cup next season . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga point calculations begin with just four games left , trainers at the bottom of the league have broken out into a sweat about where their teams will be playing next season , while the table 's top teams fight over berths in the champions league .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .
and that is where the political scientists , criminologists and technicians from the european research project urban eye come in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the vatican uses video surveillance the urban eye is a comparative research project analyzing the employment of cctv -lrb- close circuit television -rrb- in public accessible space in europe .
it intends to assess its social effects - in terms of changes in criminal and every-day behavior - and political impacts regarding law enforcement , civil rights and the character of public space in order to finally outline strategies for its regulation . britain 's bulger case launches cctv nationwide video surveillance was thrust to the fore of the public consciousness in britain in 1993 when cameras in a liverpool shopping center caught the moment when two11-year-old boys , jon venables and robert thompson , kidnapped two-year-old jamie bulger . the cameras did not prevent the subsequent murder of bulger but the tapes did lead to the conviction of the killers and the decision by the british government to invest two million pounds -lrb- 2.9 million euros , $ 3.8 million -rrb- in a nationwide system .
in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .
in england and wales , nearly 29,000 fewer people were admitted to hospital with assault related injuries in the last five years . german pilot project raises concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching over an underground mall in stuttgart in an example of where countries differ , germany has very different regulations .
for video surveillance to be approved in public spaces , the state laws need to be changed .
a pilot project in regensburg is under way where the local police in the bavarian town have created a law under which video surveillance is allowed . however , the pilot project raises some concerns surrounding the positioning of cameras in private spaces and the effect the cameras have on the reduction of crime . surveillance open to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping an eye on dresden 's train station the researchers at urban eye are concerned that there are too many gray areas in the use of video surveillance regarding effectiveness in the reduction of crime and the possible infringements of civil rights .
a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .
" and they came to the conclusion that it was mainly young black males .
in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives . " these are the questions that urban eye wants to answer as well as those regarding the effectiveness and lawful basis of cctv systems across european countries . " our recommendation would be that quality standards should be evaluated , effectiveness proven and that systems work within a lawful basis and with licenses , " hempel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.04.2005 iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision by iran couls come next week , according to rowhani iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday . " it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .
the country insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas - a vital source of hard currency . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure off in eu-iran nuke showdown an expected showdown in iran-eu nuclear talks friday in london should be more sound than fury as both sides feel the negotiations are basically on hold until after iranian presidential elections in june , diplomats said .

" it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .
and that is where the political scientists , criminologists and technicians from the european research project urban eye come in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the vatican uses video surveillance the urban eye is a comparative research project analyzing the employment of cctv -lrb- close circuit television -rrb- in public accessible space in europe .
it intends to assess its social effects - in terms of changes in criminal and every-day behavior - and political impacts regarding law enforcement , civil rights and the character of public space in order to finally outline strategies for its regulation . britain 's bulger case launches cctv nationwide video surveillance was thrust to the fore of the public consciousness in britain in 1993 when cameras in a liverpool shopping center caught the moment when two11-year-old boys , jon venables and robert thompson , kidnapped two-year-old jamie bulger . the cameras did not prevent the subsequent murder of bulger but the tapes did lead to the conviction of the killers and the decision by the british government to invest two million pounds -lrb- 2.9 million euros , $ 3.8 million -rrb- in a nationwide system .
in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .
in england and wales , nearly 29,000 fewer people were admitted to hospital with assault related injuries in the last five years . german pilot project raises concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching over an underground mall in stuttgart in an example of where countries differ , germany has very different regulations .
for video surveillance to be approved in public spaces , the state laws need to be changed .
a pilot project in regensburg is under way where the local police in the bavarian town have created a law under which video surveillance is allowed . however , the pilot project raises some concerns surrounding the positioning of cameras in private spaces and the effect the cameras have on the reduction of crime . surveillance open to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping an eye on dresden 's train station the researchers at urban eye are concerned that there are too many gray areas in the use of video surveillance regarding effectiveness in the reduction of crime and the possible infringements of civil rights .
a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .
" and they came to the conclusion that it was mainly young black males .
in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives . " these are the questions that urban eye wants to answer as well as those regarding the effectiveness and lawful basis of cctv systems across european countries . " our recommendation would be that quality standards should be evaluated , effectiveness proven and that systems work within a lawful basis and with licenses , " hempel said .

but another reason for german soccer 's fame is a university coach training program in cologne . long before germany knew it was to host the 2006 world cup , the country had another claim to soccer fame : its world renowned soccer coaching program , now finishing its 50th season . indeed , the german soccer association 's decision just after world war ii to offer a special training program for up-and-coming football coaches turned out to be a shrewd one . the legendary sepp herberger -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who led the german national team to win the world cup in 1954 , was the mastermind of the soccer coach training program .

congratulations flooded in from all over germany . bayern munich clinched their 19th german championship title with dutch international marksman roy makaay scoring a hat-trick in a comfortable 4-0 win at kaiserslautern on saturday . with three games remaining , bayern are 11 points clear after second-placed schalke drew 3-3 with 10-man bayer leverkusen , allowing munich to celebrate a fifth title in seven seasons . german international captain michael ballack , who won the 1998 title in kaiserslautern 's colors , struck a 19th minute opener against his former club to ease bayern 's nerves .
ballack picked up a pass from makaay before producing a lethal turn and shot to break the deadlock . " we proved today that we are the best team in germany and deserve to win the title , " said ballack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's headcoach felix magath is showered with beer as he and his team celebrate the win of the german championship makaay then stole the show netting a sensational hat-trick to take his season 's tally to 15 and more importantly clinch another bundesliga crown for bayern .
" i came to bayern last season to win the title but it did not happen , " said makaay .
" now i have achieved my goal and scoring three goals is the icing on the cake . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic heaped praise on his boss for stamping his authority on the team after ottmar hitzfeld had lost his magic touch .
" last season under hitzfeld we were pretty bad , but magath came along and changed that , " enthused salihamidzic .
" he had a different approach and must now keep us on the right track . " for felix magath it is a first bundesliga title in his managerial career and he has the chance to do a league and cup double in his debut season with schalke facing bayern in the cup final in berlin on may 28 .
" i am delighted to win the title with bayern , " said magath . " we were constantly informed about the schalke result and when it finished 3-3 we were elated to have won the bundesliga title . " " you can not be fully accepted at a club like bayern unless you win some silverware , " admitted magath .
" it has taken me ten years but now i have won the title and i hope to win a lot more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , a schalke fan , offered his congratulations german chancellor and schalke 04 fan gerhard schröder offered his congratulations to bayern after the 4-0 win at kaiserslautern .
" bayern deserve to be german champions and i offer my congratulations to the team , manager and the fans , " said schröder .
" when it counted bayern were the most consistent team and i wish the club all the best for next season in their new stadium . " the german press heaped praise on coach magath after the title was secured .
" felix magath - welcome to the club of great managers , " the headline ran in the mass-circulation daily bild .
" compared to lattek and hitzfeld , you have work to do .
but make no mistake , the magath era has now begun . "
udo lattek won six domestic titles with bayern while ottmar hitzfeld , magath 's predecessor , won four bundesliga crowns . " magath now accepted after title win , " declared the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung while die welt exclaimed : " teetotaler magath can now enjoy a beer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke , who have been title contenders for most of the season but must now concentrate on securing second place and an automatic champions league spot after surrendering a 3-1 lead against leverkusen , were gracious in conceding the championship . " congratulations to bayern on a 19th title , " acknowledged schalke general manager rudi assauer .
" it is getting a bit boring them winning all the time so we will try to change that next season . " paul freier put leverkusen ahead against schalke on 23 minutes but a crazy first period saw the hosts score three goals in 11 minutes .
brazilian lincoln equalized on the half-hour mark and then shot schalke in front eight minutes later with his second goal of the game .
ebbe sand made it 3-1 in the 41st minute but leverkusen stormed back to take a point . " when you lead 3-1 the game should be wrapped up , " explained schalke manager ralf rangnick .
" it was a great game but i am more concerned about the two lost points . " bulgarian international dimitar berbatov reduced the deficit in the 56th minute and andrei voronin equalized in the 64th minute as schalke collapsed . bayer had roque junior sent off late on , but schalke could not make their numerical advantage count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's coach matthias sammer was not a happy man on saturday schalke are two points clear of vfb stuttgart after matthias sammer 's side fell to a 2-0 reverse at borussia monchengladbach .
portuguese international fernando meira was sent off in the 48th minute receiving a caution for a late tackle and then another booking for throwing the ball away in annoyance .
" our performance today was just rubbish , " raged sammer .
" i think it is best if i do not talk about meira 's sending off . " the win was vital for gladbach who move five points clear of the relegation zone with third from bottom vfl bochum tasting a 6-2 home defeat at the hands of mainz 05 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock 's marcus lantz , left , and berlin 's marcelinho , right , react during rostock 's 2-1 win .
hertha berlin have been the form team in germany of late but with the stakes at their highest the capital side slumped to a 2-1 reverse at lowly hansa rostock .
hertha stay two points behind stuttgart but are joined on 53 points by german champions werder bremen . bremen crushed arminia bielefeld 3-0 to stay in the hunt for a champions league spot and manager thomas schaaf must think his luck is in with schalke , hertha and stuttgart all losing crucial points . sv hamburg also lost ground on bremen falling to a 1-0 defeat at vfl wolfsburg and have just three matches to avoid playing in the much-maligned intertoto cup next season . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga point calculations begin with just four games left , trainers at the bottom of the league have broken out into a sweat about where their teams will be playing next season , while the table 's top teams fight over berths in the champions league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.04.2005 a close look at surveillance in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the urban eye project investigates european surveillance standards a group of political scientists , criminologists and technicians have joined forces for the european research project urban eye , an investigation into the social effects and political consequences of video surveillance . for many years , security cameras have been a part of every day life in europe - in shopping centers , at cash dispensers and in airports .
germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .
and that is where the political scientists , criminologists and technicians from the european research project urban eye come in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the vatican uses video surveillance the urban eye is a comparative research project analyzing the employment of cctv -lrb- close circuit television -rrb- in public accessible space in europe .
it intends to assess its social effects - in terms of changes in criminal and every-day behavior - and political impacts regarding law enforcement , civil rights and the character of public space in order to finally outline strategies for its regulation . britain 's bulger case launches cctv nationwide video surveillance was thrust to the fore of the public consciousness in britain in 1993 when cameras in a liverpool shopping center caught the moment when two11-year-old boys , jon venables and robert thompson , kidnapped two-year-old jamie bulger . the cameras did not prevent the subsequent murder of bulger but the tapes did lead to the conviction of the killers and the decision by the british government to invest two million pounds -lrb- 2.9 million euros , $ 3.8 million -rrb- in a nationwide system .
in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .
in england and wales , nearly 29,000 fewer people were admitted to hospital with assault related injuries in the last five years . german pilot project raises concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching over an underground mall in stuttgart in an example of where countries differ , germany has very different regulations .
for video surveillance to be approved in public spaces , the state laws need to be changed .
a pilot project in regensburg is under way where the local police in the bavarian town have created a law under which video surveillance is allowed . however , the pilot project raises some concerns surrounding the positioning of cameras in private spaces and the effect the cameras have on the reduction of crime . surveillance open to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping an eye on dresden 's train station the researchers at urban eye are concerned that there are too many gray areas in the use of video surveillance regarding effectiveness in the reduction of crime and the possible infringements of civil rights .
a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .
" and they came to the conclusion that it was mainly young black males .
in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives . " these are the questions that urban eye wants to answer as well as those regarding the effectiveness and lawful basis of cctv systems across european countries . " our recommendation would be that quality standards should be evaluated , effectiveness proven and that systems work within a lawful basis and with licenses , " hempel said .
" the problem is not only that the citizen is filmed in a public space but also in private places for different reasons . " susanne gupta -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother or protector ?

" hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
i saw that with my own eyes , " misch told afp from his home in the german capital .
" but we had been expecting it .
it did n't come out of the blue .
we had been waiting for the end . " on april 30 , 1945 , with soviet forces just 300 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from the bunker and his armies beaten , hitler bade farewell to his staff and went into his private rooms .
there , the man who had plunged the world into conflict and sent millions of jews to their deaths in the holocaust poisoned a willing braun and shot himself in the head .
historians believe their bodies were then soaked with fuel and burned . " my work room was opposite the entrance to hitler 's rooms , " recalled misch , who was a 28-year-old staff sergeant in the nazi ss with responsibility for maintaining the telephone lines in the bunker .

not like in the movies " it was just operetta , dramatic operetta .
that is how the americans wanted the death of hitler to look , " misch said .
he said one of the biggest mistakes in reconstructions of the suicide is to show hitler 's bunker as a giant complex of rooms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing in this parking lot in central berlin recalls the bunker , once underneath , where hitler and eva braun committed suicide " people confuse the führer 's bunker with the upper bunker or the bunker at the reichs chancellery .

" it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .

" it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .
and that is where the political scientists , criminologists and technicians from the european research project urban eye come in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the vatican uses video surveillance the urban eye is a comparative research project analyzing the employment of cctv -lrb- close circuit television -rrb- in public accessible space in europe .
it intends to assess its social effects - in terms of changes in criminal and every-day behavior - and political impacts regarding law enforcement , civil rights and the character of public space in order to finally outline strategies for its regulation . britain 's bulger case launches cctv nationwide video surveillance was thrust to the fore of the public consciousness in britain in 1993 when cameras in a liverpool shopping center caught the moment when two11-year-old boys , jon venables and robert thompson , kidnapped two-year-old jamie bulger . the cameras did not prevent the subsequent murder of bulger but the tapes did lead to the conviction of the killers and the decision by the british government to invest two million pounds -lrb- 2.9 million euros , $ 3.8 million -rrb- in a nationwide system .
in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .

for video surveillance to be approved in public spaces , the state laws need to be changed .
a pilot project in regensburg is under way where the local police in the bavarian town have created a law under which video surveillance is allowed . however , the pilot project raises some concerns surrounding the positioning of cameras in private spaces and the effect the cameras have on the reduction of crime . surveillance open to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping an eye on dresden 's train station the researchers at urban eye are concerned that there are too many gray areas in the use of video surveillance regarding effectiveness in the reduction of crime and the possible infringements of civil rights .
a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .
" and they came to the conclusion that it was mainly young black males .
in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives . " these are the questions that urban eye wants to answer as well as those regarding the effectiveness and lawful basis of cctv systems across european countries .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .

in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .

in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .

the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .

but another reason for german soccer 's fame is a university coach training program in cologne . long before germany knew it was to host the 2006 world cup , the country had another claim to soccer fame : its world renowned soccer coaching program , now finishing its 50th season . indeed , the german soccer association 's decision just after world war ii to offer a special training program for up-and-coming football coaches turned out to be a shrewd one . the legendary sepp herberger -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who led the german national team to win the world cup in 1954 , was the mastermind of the soccer coach training program . " the soccer coach training program started back in 1947 at our university , " said walter tokarski , director of the german sport university in cologne , adding that all the directors of the program were also successful teachers or even trained here themselves - people like herberger , hennes weisweiler , gero bisanz and now erich rutemöller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a special vision since then , over one thousand students have gained their state-approved degrees as soccer coaches .
while they were originally expected to work in germany , they 've meanwhile become one of the country 's best exports , said gero bisanz , who directed the coach training program for nearly 30 years . " our courses continue to have an excellent international reputation , " bisanz said .
" former soccer players from all five continents and 49 different national associations of the international fifa association have completed their course of studies at our university . " a model program the cologne program has been a model for training courses in japan , malaysia , and iran .
but european countries also work together and recognize each others ' coaching licenses , said erich rutemöller , director of the cologne coach training program . " we have a dutch colleague completing his degree right now , " rutemöller said .
" he first got his coaching licenses in the netherlands , is now getting his training degree here with us and will go on to become a professional coach in the ukraine first division league . " the training program lasts six months and combines coaching and sports theory , sports medicine , and practical experience , including a one-month internship at a german soccer league club .
following two-week long exams , graduates can apply for a license as a soccer trainer with the german soccer association and then coach professionally throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trailblazer women have been attending the soccer coach academy in cologne since 1985 .

congratulations flooded in from all over germany . bayern munich clinched their 19th german championship title with dutch international marksman roy makaay scoring a hat-trick in a comfortable 4-0 win at kaiserslautern on saturday . with three games remaining , bayern are 11 points clear after second-placed schalke drew 3-3 with 10-man bayer leverkusen , allowing munich to celebrate a fifth title in seven seasons . german international captain michael ballack , who won the 1998 title in kaiserslautern 's colors , struck a 19th minute opener against his former club to ease bayern 's nerves .
ballack picked up a pass from makaay before producing a lethal turn and shot to break the deadlock . " we proved today that we are the best team in germany and deserve to win the title , " said ballack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's headcoach felix magath is showered with beer as he and his team celebrate the win of the german championship makaay then stole the show netting a sensational hat-trick to take his season 's tally to 15 and more importantly clinch another bundesliga crown for bayern .
" i came to bayern last season to win the title but it did not happen , " said makaay .
" now i have achieved my goal and scoring three goals is the icing on the cake . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic heaped praise on his boss for stamping his authority on the team after ottmar hitzfeld had lost his magic touch .
" last season under hitzfeld we were pretty bad , but magath came along and changed that , " enthused salihamidzic .
" he had a different approach and must now keep us on the right track . " for felix magath it is a first bundesliga title in his managerial career and he has the chance to do a league and cup double in his debut season with schalke facing bayern in the cup final in berlin on may 28 .
" i am delighted to win the title with bayern , " said magath . " we were constantly informed about the schalke result and when it finished 3-3 we were elated to have won the bundesliga title . " " you can not be fully accepted at a club like bayern unless you win some silverware , " admitted magath .
" it has taken me ten years but now i have won the title and i hope to win a lot more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , a schalke fan , offered his congratulations german chancellor and schalke 04 fan gerhard schröder offered his congratulations to bayern after the 4-0 win at kaiserslautern .
" bayern deserve to be german champions and i offer my congratulations to the team , manager and the fans , " said schröder .
" when it counted bayern were the most consistent team and i wish the club all the best for next season in their new stadium . " the german press heaped praise on coach magath after the title was secured .
" felix magath - welcome to the club of great managers , " the headline ran in the mass-circulation daily bild .
" compared to lattek and hitzfeld , you have work to do .
but make no mistake , the magath era has now begun . "
udo lattek won six domestic titles with bayern while ottmar hitzfeld , magath 's predecessor , won four bundesliga crowns . " magath now accepted after title win , " declared the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung while die welt exclaimed : " teetotaler magath can now enjoy a beer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke , who have been title contenders for most of the season but must now concentrate on securing second place and an automatic champions league spot after surrendering a 3-1 lead against leverkusen , were gracious in conceding the championship . " congratulations to bayern on a 19th title , " acknowledged schalke general manager rudi assauer .
" it is getting a bit boring them winning all the time so we will try to change that next season . " paul freier put leverkusen ahead against schalke on 23 minutes but a crazy first period saw the hosts score three goals in 11 minutes .
brazilian lincoln equalized on the half-hour mark and then shot schalke in front eight minutes later with his second goal of the game .
ebbe sand made it 3-1 in the 41st minute but leverkusen stormed back to take a point . " when you lead 3-1 the game should be wrapped up , " explained schalke manager ralf rangnick .
" it was a great game but i am more concerned about the two lost points . " bulgarian international dimitar berbatov reduced the deficit in the 56th minute and andrei voronin equalized in the 64th minute as schalke collapsed . bayer had roque junior sent off late on , but schalke could not make their numerical advantage count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's coach matthias sammer was not a happy man on saturday schalke are two points clear of vfb stuttgart after matthias sammer 's side fell to a 2-0 reverse at borussia monchengladbach .
portuguese international fernando meira was sent off in the 48th minute receiving a caution for a late tackle and then another booking for throwing the ball away in annoyance .
" our performance today was just rubbish , " raged sammer .
" i think it is best if i do not talk about meira 's sending off . " the win was vital for gladbach who move five points clear of the relegation zone with third from bottom vfl bochum tasting a 6-2 home defeat at the hands of mainz 05 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock 's marcus lantz , left , and berlin 's marcelinho , right , react during rostock 's 2-1 win .
hertha berlin have been the form team in germany of late but with the stakes at their highest the capital side slumped to a 2-1 reverse at lowly hansa rostock .
hertha stay two points behind stuttgart but are joined on 53 points by german champions werder bremen . bremen crushed arminia bielefeld 3-0 to stay in the hunt for a champions league spot and manager thomas schaaf must think his luck is in with schalke , hertha and stuttgart all losing crucial points . sv hamburg also lost ground on bremen falling to a 1-0 defeat at vfl wolfsburg and have just three matches to avoid playing in the much-maligned intertoto cup next season . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga point calculations begin with just four games left , trainers at the bottom of the league have broken out into a sweat about where their teams will be playing next season , while the table 's top teams fight over berths in the champions league .

congratulations flooded in from all over germany . bayern munich clinched their 19th german championship title with dutch international marksman roy makaay scoring a hat-trick in a comfortable 4-0 win at kaiserslautern on saturday . with three games remaining , bayern are 11 points clear after second-placed schalke drew 3-3 with 10-man bayer leverkusen , allowing munich to celebrate a fifth title in seven seasons . german international captain michael ballack , who won the 1998 title in kaiserslautern 's colors , struck a 19th minute opener against his former club to ease bayern 's nerves .
ballack picked up a pass from makaay before producing a lethal turn and shot to break the deadlock . " we proved today that we are the best team in germany and deserve to win the title , " said ballack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's headcoach felix magath is showered with beer as he and his team celebrate the win of the german championship makaay then stole the show netting a sensational hat-trick to take his season 's tally to 15 and more importantly clinch another bundesliga crown for bayern .
" i came to bayern last season to win the title but it did not happen , " said makaay .
" now i have achieved my goal and scoring three goals is the icing on the cake . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic heaped praise on his boss for stamping his authority on the team after ottmar hitzfeld had lost his magic touch .
" last season under hitzfeld we were pretty bad , but magath came along and changed that , " enthused salihamidzic .
" he had a different approach and must now keep us on the right track . " for felix magath it is a first bundesliga title in his managerial career and he has the chance to do a league and cup double in his debut season with schalke facing bayern in the cup final in berlin on may 28 .
" i am delighted to win the title with bayern , " said magath . " we were constantly informed about the schalke result and when it finished 3-3 we were elated to have won the bundesliga title .

" it has taken me ten years but now i have won the title and i hope to win a lot more .

" felix magath - welcome to the club of great managers , " the headline ran in the mass-circulation daily bild .
" compared to lattek and hitzfeld , you have work to do .
but make no mistake , the magath era has now begun . "
udo lattek won six domestic titles with bayern while ottmar hitzfeld , magath 's predecessor , won four bundesliga crowns . " magath now accepted after title win , " declared the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung while die welt exclaimed : " teetotaler magath can now enjoy a beer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke , who have been title contenders for most of the season but must now concentrate on securing second place and an automatic champions league spot after surrendering a 3-1 lead against leverkusen , were gracious in conceding the championship . " congratulations to bayern on a 19th title , " acknowledged schalke general manager rudi assauer .
" it is getting a bit boring them winning all the time so we will try to change that next season . " paul freier put leverkusen ahead against schalke on 23 minutes but a crazy first period saw the hosts score three goals in 11 minutes .
brazilian lincoln equalized on the half-hour mark and then shot schalke in front eight minutes later with his second goal of the game .
ebbe sand made it 3-1 in the 41st minute but leverkusen stormed back to take a point . " when you lead 3-1 the game should be wrapped up , " explained schalke manager ralf rangnick .
" it was a great game but i am more concerned about the two lost points . " bulgarian international dimitar berbatov reduced the deficit in the 56th minute and andrei voronin equalized in the 64th minute as schalke collapsed . bayer had roque junior sent off late on , but schalke could not make their numerical advantage count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's coach matthias sammer was not a happy man on saturday schalke are two points clear of vfb stuttgart after matthias sammer 's side fell to a 2-0 reverse at borussia monchengladbach .
portuguese international fernando meira was sent off in the 48th minute receiving a caution for a late tackle and then another booking for throwing the ball away in annoyance .
" our performance today was just rubbish , " raged sammer .
" i think it is best if i do not talk about meira 's sending off . " the win was vital for gladbach who move five points clear of the relegation zone with third from bottom vfl bochum tasting a 6-2 home defeat at the hands of mainz 05 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock 's marcus lantz , left , and berlin 's marcelinho , right , react during rostock 's 2-1 win .

" i came to bayern last season to win the title but it did not happen , " said makaay .
" now i have achieved my goal and scoring three goals is the icing on the cake . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic heaped praise on his boss for stamping his authority on the team after ottmar hitzfeld had lost his magic touch .

congratulations flooded in from all over germany . bayern munich clinched their 19th german championship title with dutch international marksman roy makaay scoring a hat-trick in a comfortable 4-0 win at kaiserslautern on saturday . with three games remaining , bayern are 11 points clear after second-placed schalke drew 3-3 with 10-man bayer leverkusen , allowing munich to celebrate a fifth title in seven seasons . german international captain michael ballack , who won the 1998 title in kaiserslautern 's colors , struck a 19th minute opener against his former club to ease bayern 's nerves .
ballack picked up a pass from makaay before producing a lethal turn and shot to break the deadlock . " we proved today that we are the best team in germany and deserve to win the title , " said ballack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's headcoach felix magath is showered with beer as he and his team celebrate the win of the german championship makaay then stole the show netting a sensational hat-trick to take his season 's tally to 15 and more importantly clinch another bundesliga crown for bayern .
" i came to bayern last season to win the title but it did not happen , " said makaay .
" now i have achieved my goal and scoring three goals is the icing on the cake . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic heaped praise on his boss for stamping his authority on the team after ottmar hitzfeld had lost his magic touch .
" last season under hitzfeld we were pretty bad , but magath came along and changed that , " enthused salihamidzic .
" he had a different approach and must now keep us on the right track . " for felix magath it is a first bundesliga title in his managerial career and he has the chance to do a league and cup double in his debut season with schalke facing bayern in the cup final in berlin on may 28 .
" i am delighted to win the title with bayern , " said magath . " we were constantly informed about the schalke result and when it finished 3-3 we were elated to have won the bundesliga title . " " you can not be fully accepted at a club like bayern unless you win some silverware , " admitted magath .
" it has taken me ten years but now i have won the title and i hope to win a lot more .

" felix magath - welcome to the club of great managers , " the headline ran in the mass-circulation daily bild .
" compared to lattek and hitzfeld , you have work to do .
but make no mistake , the magath era has now begun . "
udo lattek won six domestic titles with bayern while ottmar hitzfeld , magath 's predecessor , won four bundesliga crowns . " magath now accepted after title win , " declared the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung while die welt exclaimed : " teetotaler magath can now enjoy a beer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke , who have been title contenders for most of the season but must now concentrate on securing second place and an automatic champions league spot after surrendering a 3-1 lead against leverkusen , were gracious in conceding the championship . " congratulations to bayern on a 19th title , " acknowledged schalke general manager rudi assauer .
" it is getting a bit boring them winning all the time so we will try to change that next season . " paul freier put leverkusen ahead against schalke on 23 minutes but a crazy first period saw the hosts score three goals in 11 minutes .
brazilian lincoln equalized on the half-hour mark and then shot schalke in front eight minutes later with his second goal of the game .
ebbe sand made it 3-1 in the 41st minute but leverkusen stormed back to take a point . " when you lead 3-1 the game should be wrapped up , " explained schalke manager ralf rangnick .
" it was a great game but i am more concerned about the two lost points . " bulgarian international dimitar berbatov reduced the deficit in the 56th minute and andrei voronin equalized in the 64th minute as schalke collapsed . bayer had roque junior sent off late on , but schalke could not make their numerical advantage count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's coach matthias sammer was not a happy man on saturday schalke are two points clear of vfb stuttgart after matthias sammer 's side fell to a 2-0 reverse at borussia monchengladbach .
portuguese international fernando meira was sent off in the 48th minute receiving a caution for a late tackle and then another booking for throwing the ball away in annoyance .
" our performance today was just rubbish , " raged sammer .
" i think it is best if i do not talk about meira 's sending off .

"
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .

but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .

but another reason for german soccer 's fame is a university coach training program in cologne . long before germany knew it was to host the 2006 world cup , the country had another claim to soccer fame : its world renowned soccer coaching program , now finishing its 50th season . indeed , the german soccer association 's decision just after world war ii to offer a special training program for up-and-coming football coaches turned out to be a shrewd one . the legendary sepp herberger -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who led the german national team to win the world cup in 1954 , was the mastermind of the soccer coach training program . " the soccer coach training program started back in 1947 at our university , " said walter tokarski , director of the german sport university in cologne , adding that all the directors of the program were also successful teachers or even trained here themselves - people like herberger , hennes weisweiler , gero bisanz and now erich rutemöller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a special vision since then , over one thousand students have gained their state-approved degrees as soccer coaches .
while they were originally expected to work in germany , they 've meanwhile become one of the country 's best exports , said gero bisanz , who directed the coach training program for nearly 30 years . " our courses continue to have an excellent international reputation , " bisanz said .
" former soccer players from all five continents and 49 different national associations of the international fifa association have completed their course of studies at our university . " a model program the cologne program has been a model for training courses in japan , malaysia , and iran .
but european countries also work together and recognize each others ' coaching licenses , said erich rutemöller , director of the cologne coach training program . " we have a dutch colleague completing his degree right now , " rutemöller said .
" he first got his coaching licenses in the netherlands , is now getting his training degree here with us and will go on to become a professional coach in the ukraine first division league . " the training program lasts six months and combines coaching and sports theory , sports medicine , and practical experience , including a one-month internship at a german soccer league club .
following two-week long exams , graduates can apply for a license as a soccer trainer with the german soccer association and then coach professionally throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trailblazer women have been attending the soccer coach academy in cologne since 1985 .
thirteen have completed the program so far .

" it was a great game but i am more concerned about the two lost points . " bulgarian international dimitar berbatov reduced the deficit in the 56th minute and andrei voronin equalized in the 64th minute as schalke collapsed . bayer had roque junior sent off late on , but schalke could not make their numerical advantage count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's coach matthias sammer was not a happy man on saturday schalke are two points clear of vfb stuttgart after matthias sammer 's side fell to a 2-0 reverse at borussia monchengladbach .
portuguese international fernando meira was sent off in the 48th minute receiving a caution for a late tackle and then another booking for throwing the ball away in annoyance .
" our performance today was just rubbish , " raged sammer .
" i think it is best if i do not talk about meira 's sending off .

" it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .

ballack picked up a pass from makaay before producing a lethal turn and shot to break the deadlock . " we proved today that we are the best team in germany and deserve to win the title , " said ballack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's headcoach felix magath is showered with beer as he and his team celebrate the win of the german championship makaay then stole the show netting a sensational hat-trick to take his season 's tally to 15 and more importantly clinch another bundesliga crown for bayern .
" i came to bayern last season to win the title but it did not happen , " said makaay .
" now i have achieved my goal and scoring three goals is the icing on the cake . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic heaped praise on his boss for stamping his authority on the team after ottmar hitzfeld had lost his magic touch .
" last season under hitzfeld we were pretty bad , but magath came along and changed that , " enthused salihamidzic .

" magath now accepted after title win , " declared the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung while die welt exclaimed : " teetotaler magath can now enjoy a beer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke , who have been title contenders for most of the season but must now concentrate on securing second place and an automatic champions league spot after surrendering a 3-1 lead against leverkusen , were gracious in conceding the championship . " congratulations to bayern on a 19th title , " acknowledged schalke general manager rudi assauer .
" it is getting a bit boring them winning all the time so we will try to change that next season . " paul freier put leverkusen ahead against schalke on 23 minutes but a crazy first period saw the hosts score three goals in 11 minutes .
brazilian lincoln equalized on the half-hour mark and then shot schalke in front eight minutes later with his second goal of the game .
ebbe sand made it 3-1 in the 41st minute but leverkusen stormed back to take a point . " when you lead 3-1 the game should be wrapped up , " explained schalke manager ralf rangnick .
" it was a great game but i am more concerned about the two lost points . " bulgarian international dimitar berbatov reduced the deficit in the 56th minute and andrei voronin equalized in the 64th minute as schalke collapsed . bayer had roque junior sent off late on , but schalke could not make their numerical advantage count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's coach matthias sammer was not a happy man on saturday schalke are two points clear of vfb stuttgart after matthias sammer 's side fell to a 2-0 reverse at borussia monchengladbach .
portuguese international fernando meira was sent off in the 48th minute receiving a caution for a late tackle and then another booking for throwing the ball away in annoyance .
" our performance today was just rubbish , " raged sammer .
" i think it is best if i do not talk about meira 's sending off . " the win was vital for gladbach who move five points clear of the relegation zone with third from bottom vfl bochum tasting a 6-2 home defeat at the hands of mainz 05 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock 's marcus lantz , left , and berlin 's marcelinho , right , react during rostock 's 2-1 win .

" it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .

in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .

the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .

a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .

in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .
and that is where the political scientists , criminologists and technicians from the european research project urban eye come in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the vatican uses video surveillance the urban eye is a comparative research project analyzing the employment of cctv -lrb- close circuit television -rrb- in public accessible space in europe .
it intends to assess its social effects - in terms of changes in criminal and every-day behavior - and political impacts regarding law enforcement , civil rights and the character of public space in order to finally outline strategies for its regulation . britain 's bulger case launches cctv nationwide video surveillance was thrust to the fore of the public consciousness in britain in 1993 when cameras in a liverpool shopping center caught the moment when two11-year-old boys , jon venables and robert thompson , kidnapped two-year-old jamie bulger . the cameras did not prevent the subsequent murder of bulger but the tapes did lead to the conviction of the killers and the decision by the british government to invest two million pounds -lrb- 2.9 million euros , $ 3.8 million -rrb- in a nationwide system .
in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .
in england and wales , nearly 29,000 fewer people were admitted to hospital with assault related injuries in the last five years . german pilot project raises concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching over an underground mall in stuttgart in an example of where countries differ , germany has very different regulations .
for video surveillance to be approved in public spaces , the state laws need to be changed .
a pilot project in regensburg is under way where the local police in the bavarian town have created a law under which video surveillance is allowed . however , the pilot project raises some concerns surrounding the positioning of cameras in private spaces and the effect the cameras have on the reduction of crime . surveillance open to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping an eye on dresden 's train station the researchers at urban eye are concerned that there are too many gray areas in the use of video surveillance regarding effectiveness in the reduction of crime and the possible infringements of civil rights .
a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .
" and they came to the conclusion that it was mainly young black males .
in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives . " these are the questions that urban eye wants to answer as well as those regarding the effectiveness and lawful basis of cctv systems across european countries . " our recommendation would be that quality standards should be evaluated , effectiveness proven and that systems work within a lawful basis and with licenses , " hempel said .
" the problem is not only that the citizen is filmed in a public space but also in private places for different reasons . " susanne gupta -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother or protector ?

ballack picked up a pass from makaay before producing a lethal turn and shot to break the deadlock . " we proved today that we are the best team in germany and deserve to win the title , " said ballack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's headcoach felix magath is showered with beer as he and his team celebrate the win of the german championship makaay then stole the show netting a sensational hat-trick to take his season 's tally to 15 and more importantly clinch another bundesliga crown for bayern .
" i came to bayern last season to win the title but it did not happen , " said makaay .
" now i have achieved my goal and scoring three goals is the icing on the cake . " bosnian international hasan salihamidzic heaped praise on his boss for stamping his authority on the team after ottmar hitzfeld had lost his magic touch .
" last season under hitzfeld we were pretty bad , but magath came along and changed that , " enthused salihamidzic .

" felix magath - welcome to the club of great managers , " the headline ran in the mass-circulation daily bild .
" compared to lattek and hitzfeld , you have work to do .
but make no mistake , the magath era has now begun . "
udo lattek won six domestic titles with bayern while ottmar hitzfeld , magath 's predecessor , won four bundesliga crowns . " magath now accepted after title win , " declared the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung while die welt exclaimed : " teetotaler magath can now enjoy a beer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke , who have been title contenders for most of the season but must now concentrate on securing second place and an automatic champions league spot after surrendering a 3-1 lead against leverkusen , were gracious in conceding the championship . " congratulations to bayern on a 19th title , " acknowledged schalke general manager rudi assauer .
" it is getting a bit boring them winning all the time so we will try to change that next season . " paul freier put leverkusen ahead against schalke on 23 minutes but a crazy first period saw the hosts score three goals in 11 minutes .
brazilian lincoln equalized on the half-hour mark and then shot schalke in front eight minutes later with his second goal of the game .
ebbe sand made it 3-1 in the 41st minute but leverkusen stormed back to take a point . " when you lead 3-1 the game should be wrapped up , " explained schalke manager ralf rangnick .
" it was a great game but i am more concerned about the two lost points . " bulgarian international dimitar berbatov reduced the deficit in the 56th minute and andrei voronin equalized in the 64th minute as schalke collapsed . bayer had roque junior sent off late on , but schalke could not make their numerical advantage count . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's coach matthias sammer was not a happy man on saturday schalke are two points clear of vfb stuttgart after matthias sammer 's side fell to a 2-0 reverse at borussia monchengladbach .
portuguese international fernando meira was sent off in the 48th minute receiving a caution for a late tackle and then another booking for throwing the ball away in annoyance .
" our performance today was just rubbish , " raged sammer .
" i think it is best if i do not talk about meira 's sending off . " the win was vital for gladbach who move five points clear of the relegation zone with third from bottom vfl bochum tasting a 6-2 home defeat at the hands of mainz 05 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock 's marcus lantz , left , and berlin 's marcelinho , right , react during rostock 's 2-1 win .

germany has had the electronic eye since the 1950s when the first traffic cameras were introduced . in the 1990s , the number of cameras positioned in public and urban locations expanded rapidly on a global scale ; from london to tehran , berlin to beijing , where the use of video equipment was turned to fighting crime and vandalism .
for advocates , surveillance is a necessary and efficient security measure , for opponents it is an infringement of privacy . it seems that the debate is set to rage on until there is a uniform set of regulations which will placate both sides .
and that is where the political scientists , criminologists and technicians from the european research project urban eye come in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the vatican uses video surveillance the urban eye is a comparative research project analyzing the employment of cctv -lrb- close circuit television -rrb- in public accessible space in europe .
it intends to assess its social effects - in terms of changes in criminal and every-day behavior - and political impacts regarding law enforcement , civil rights and the character of public space in order to finally outline strategies for its regulation . britain 's bulger case launches cctv nationwide video surveillance was thrust to the fore of the public consciousness in britain in 1993 when cameras in a liverpool shopping center caught the moment when two11-year-old boys , jon venables and robert thompson , kidnapped two-year-old jamie bulger . the cameras did not prevent the subsequent murder of bulger but the tapes did lead to the conviction of the killers and the decision by the british government to invest two million pounds -lrb- 2.9 million euros , $ 3.8 million -rrb- in a nationwide system .
in 1991 there were just 10 systems in the britain .
now there are four million , more than any other country in europe . the bulger case was instrumental in the rise of video surveillance systems across europe , said leon hempel , a social scientist at the center of technology and society at the technical university of berlin , which coordinates the urban eye project .
the case persuaded the british public of the advantages of having video surveillance cameras in public spaces and the effectiveness of systems in preventing crime , he added . legal questions raised over cctv roll out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surveillance camera in a car tunnel " the intense media attention afforded to the case played on the growing paranoia in britain at that time , " hempel said , adding that the roll out of technology across the country gave the impression that video systems would make the populace safer .
the 75 percent reduction in crime as a result seemed to prove that assumption . however , the widespread introduction of video cameras in britain raised a number of legal questions which were only addressed much later .
it was only until the introduction of the data protection act of 1998 , some five years after the bulger case , that cctv systems had to have an explicit legal basis to be employed in public spaces . since then , the impact of cctv on british cities has led to a reduction in violent attacks resulting in serious injury , according to figures released this week .
jonathan shepherd , who led the study conducted by cardiff university , told british daily the independent that the installation of cctv cameras in city centers had helped prevent injuries from violence even though it had not curbed the number of assaults .
in england and wales , nearly 29,000 fewer people were admitted to hospital with assault related injuries in the last five years . german pilot project raises concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching over an underground mall in stuttgart in an example of where countries differ , germany has very different regulations .
for video surveillance to be approved in public spaces , the state laws need to be changed .
a pilot project in regensburg is under way where the local police in the bavarian town have created a law under which video surveillance is allowed . however , the pilot project raises some concerns surrounding the positioning of cameras in private spaces and the effect the cameras have on the reduction of crime . surveillance open to abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping an eye on dresden 's train station the researchers at urban eye are concerned that there are too many gray areas in the use of video surveillance regarding effectiveness in the reduction of crime and the possible infringements of civil rights .
a british study by researchers clive norris and gary armstrong , which consisted of a study of 600 hours of footage , also hinted at possible discrimination problems and abuse of surveillance equipment . " the researchers sat and watched what and who were being observed , " hempel said .
" and they came to the conclusion that it was mainly young black males .
in this respect , the surveillance reinforces a certain prejudice and asks important questions about the observation practices of some security operatives . " these are the questions that urban eye wants to answer as well as those regarding the effectiveness and lawful basis of cctv systems across european countries . " our recommendation would be that quality standards should be evaluated , effectiveness proven and that systems work within a lawful basis and with licenses , " hempel said .
" the problem is not only that the citizen is filmed in a public space but also in private places for different reasons . " susanne gupta -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother or protector ?

but another reason for german soccer 's fame is a university coach training program in cologne . long before germany knew it was to host the 2006 world cup , the country had another claim to soccer fame : its world renowned soccer coaching program , now finishing its 50th season . indeed , the german soccer association 's decision just after world war ii to offer a special training program for up-and-coming football coaches turned out to be a shrewd one . the legendary sepp herberger -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who led the german national team to win the world cup in 1954 , was the mastermind of the soccer coach training program . " the soccer coach training program started back in 1947 at our university , " said walter tokarski , director of the german sport university in cologne , adding that all the directors of the program were also successful teachers or even trained here themselves - people like herberger , hennes weisweiler , gero bisanz and now erich rutemöller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a special vision since then , over one thousand students have gained their state-approved degrees as soccer coaches .
while they were originally expected to work in germany , they 've meanwhile become one of the country 's best exports , said gero bisanz , who directed the coach training program for nearly 30 years . " our courses continue to have an excellent international reputation , " bisanz said .
" former soccer players from all five continents and 49 different national associations of the international fifa association have completed their course of studies at our university . " a model program the cologne program has been a model for training courses in japan , malaysia , and iran .
but european countries also work together and recognize each others ' coaching licenses , said erich rutemöller , director of the cologne coach training program . " we have a dutch colleague completing his degree right now , " rutemöller said .
" he first got his coaching licenses in the netherlands , is now getting his training degree here with us and will go on to become a professional coach in the ukraine first division league . " the training program lasts six months and combines coaching and sports theory , sports medicine , and practical experience , including a one-month internship at a german soccer league club .
following two-week long exams , graduates can apply for a license as a soccer trainer with the german soccer association and then coach professionally throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trailblazer women have been attending the soccer coach academy in cologne since 1985 .

" hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
i saw that with my own eyes , " misch told afp from his home in the german capital .
" but we had been expecting it .
it did n't come out of the blue .
we had been waiting for the end . " on april 30 , 1945 , with soviet forces just 300 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from the bunker and his armies beaten , hitler bade farewell to his staff and went into his private rooms .
there , the man who had plunged the world into conflict and sent millions of jews to their deaths in the holocaust poisoned a willing braun and shot himself in the head .
historians believe their bodies were then soaked with fuel and burned . " my work room was opposite the entrance to hitler 's rooms , " recalled misch , who was a 28-year-old staff sergeant in the nazi ss with responsibility for maintaining the telephone lines in the bunker .
hitler 's suicide no surprise " i remember that he said goodbye in the corridor and went into the rooms .
he said he did n't want to be disturbed .
i do n't know how long it took , maybe one hour , maybe two .
i did n't hear the shots myself because i was working on the telephones .
but then i heard someone shout ' linge , linge , i think it has happened . '
-lrb- heinz linge was hitler 's servant -rrb- .
we waited maybe 20 minutes .
then we opened the door to his office and the one to the living room .
hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
it was n't a surprise .

but despite having cooperated with the director oliver hirschbiegel on the making of the film , misch now says it was riddled with inaccuracies .
not like in the movies " it was just operetta , dramatic operetta .
that is how the americans wanted the death of hitler to look , " misch said .
he said one of the biggest mistakes in reconstructions of the suicide is to show hitler 's bunker as a giant complex of rooms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing in this parking lot in central berlin recalls the bunker , once underneath , where hitler and eva braun committed suicide " people confuse the führer 's bunker with the upper bunker or the bunker at the reichs chancellery .
in fact the bunker we were in was so small .
we were not a whole company , there were just five people .
only five of us could have witnessed the death , no more . " the site stands today a few hundred meters from the glitzy shopping center and office complex which now fills potsdamer platz in central berlin .
there is no plaque to mark the location . on may 10 , a national monument to the victims of the holocaust will open just a few steps from the spot where hitler ended his life . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

but another reason for german soccer 's fame is a university coach training program in cologne . long before germany knew it was to host the 2006 world cup , the country had another claim to soccer fame : its world renowned soccer coaching program , now finishing its 50th season . indeed , the german soccer association 's decision just after world war ii to offer a special training program for up-and-coming football coaches turned out to be a shrewd one . the legendary sepp herberger -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who led the german national team to win the world cup in 1954 , was the mastermind of the soccer coach training program . " the soccer coach training program started back in 1947 at our university , " said walter tokarski , director of the german sport university in cologne , adding that all the directors of the program were also successful teachers or even trained here themselves - people like herberger , hennes weisweiler , gero bisanz and now erich rutemöller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a special vision since then , over one thousand students have gained their state-approved degrees as soccer coaches .
while they were originally expected to work in germany , they 've meanwhile become one of the country 's best exports , said gero bisanz , who directed the coach training program for nearly 30 years . " our courses continue to have an excellent international reputation , " bisanz said .
" former soccer players from all five continents and 49 different national associations of the international fifa association have completed their course of studies at our university . " a model program the cologne program has been a model for training courses in japan , malaysia , and iran .
but european countries also work together and recognize each others ' coaching licenses , said erich rutemöller , director of the cologne coach training program . " we have a dutch colleague completing his degree right now , " rutemöller said .
" he first got his coaching licenses in the netherlands , is now getting his training degree here with us and will go on to become a professional coach in the ukraine first division league . " the training program lasts six months and combines coaching and sports theory , sports medicine , and practical experience , including a one-month internship at a german soccer league club .
following two-week long exams , graduates can apply for a license as a soccer trainer with the german soccer association and then coach professionally throughout europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trailblazer women have been attending the soccer coach academy in cologne since 1985 .

" hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
i saw that with my own eyes , " misch told afp from his home in the german capital .
" but we had been expecting it .
it did n't come out of the blue .
we had been waiting for the end . " on april 30 , 1945 , with soviet forces just 300 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- from the bunker and his armies beaten , hitler bade farewell to his staff and went into his private rooms .
there , the man who had plunged the world into conflict and sent millions of jews to their deaths in the holocaust poisoned a willing braun and shot himself in the head .
historians believe their bodies were then soaked with fuel and burned . " my work room was opposite the entrance to hitler 's rooms , " recalled misch , who was a 28-year-old staff sergeant in the nazi ss with responsibility for maintaining the telephone lines in the bunker .
hitler 's suicide no surprise " i remember that he said goodbye in the corridor and went into the rooms .
he said he did n't want to be disturbed .
i do n't know how long it took , maybe one hour , maybe two .
i did n't hear the shots myself because i was working on the telephones .
but then i heard someone shout ' linge , linge , i think it has happened . '
-lrb- heinz linge was hitler 's servant -rrb- .
we waited maybe 20 minutes .
then we opened the door to his office and the one to the living room .
hitler was sitting at the table , slumped forward , and eva braun was lying next to him .
it was n't a surprise .
the commanders had all wanted to evacuate hitler , but he said no , he was staying in berlin . " nine days later germany surrendered and the guns of world war ii fell quiet in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the downfall " with juliane köhler -lrb- eva braun -rrb- , bruno ganz -lrb- adolf hitler -rrb- and heino ferch -lrb- albert speer -rrb- hitler 's final days were portrayed in great detail in " the downfall , " a big-budget german film which came out in germany last september and has been a success worldwide .
but despite having cooperated with the director oliver hirschbiegel on the making of the film , misch now says it was riddled with inaccuracies .
not like in the movies " it was just operetta , dramatic operetta .
that is how the americans wanted the death of hitler to look , " misch said .
he said one of the biggest mistakes in reconstructions of the suicide is to show hitler 's bunker as a giant complex of rooms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nothing in this parking lot in central berlin recalls the bunker , once underneath , where hitler and eva braun committed suicide " people confuse the führer 's bunker with the upper bunker or the bunker at the reichs chancellery .
in fact the bunker we were in was so small .
we were not a whole company , there were just five people .
only five of us could have witnessed the death , no more . " the site stands today a few hundred meters from the glitzy shopping center and office complex which now fills potsdamer platz in central berlin .
there is no plaque to mark the location . on may 10 , a national monument to the victims of the holocaust will open just a few steps from the spot where hitler ended his life . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.04.2005 iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision by iran couls come next week , according to rowhani iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday . " it is unlikely that we will resume enrichment , that is to say the activities at natanz .
but some activities at the ucf -lrb- uranium conversion facility -rrb- at isfahan could resume next week , " top negotiator hassan rowhani was quoted as saying by the irna and mehr news agencies . rowhani , the secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said " the current process can not continue in the way the europeans want it to and iran could take new decisions . "
he added that " a definitive decision on whether or not to resume uranium enrichment will be taken next week " by the islamic republic 's leadership . uranium conversion involves turning raw uranium into uf6 gas .
that can be fed into centrifuges that refine out enriched uranium , which can be directed towards making fuel for atomic reactors or the core of a nuclear weapon .
uranium conversion is covered by a freeze agreed to by iran in november 2004 under a deal that kick-started a series of talks with britain , france and germany that are aimed at easing international fears the islamic republic is seeking the bomb . if iran carries through its most serious challenge yet of the eu deal , it risks being hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions .
the eu , backed by the united states , wants iran to halt all nuclear fuel cycle activities - fearing enrichment technology would give iran the capacity to produce a bomb .
in return , it is offering a package of trade , security and technology incentives . iran unsatisfied with talks but after the latest round of talks with the eu in london on friday , top national security spokesman ali agha mohammadi told afp iran was " unhappy . "
" the negotiations were good on content and there were principled agreements , and the europeans were closer than ever to our point of view , " said mohammadi , a spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council .
" but concerning the application and the timetable , iran is unhappy with the results , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boushehr nuclear power plant in tehran iran has said repeatedly that its enrichment suspension is temporary and voluntary , as it insists on its right under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty to make nuclear fuel .
mohammadi said the iranian side " feel the europeans are merely trying to delay " a resumption of enrichment . also speaking in london after the talks , iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri said " some progress " had been made but there was still no agreement .
" we believe there has been some progress on the framework for a long-term agreement ... the difference is about the timing , " nasseri told afp . according to diplomatic sources , the iranians are seeking agreement on the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a cascade of about 2,000 centrifuges could produce enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say , although iran has said it would produce only low-enriched uranium .
iran wants to be able to expand the facility to eventually include more than 50,000 centrifuges , which would be an industrial level of production . next step open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has been investigating iran for years nasseri said : " we have examined further the elements of this phased approach which we believe covers the concerns and interests of both sides in an equitable manner .
the difference however is about the timing , particularly of the initial stage .
we have not been able to move forward on this and the situation is going to be evaluated in the capitals , " he said , referring to london , paris , berlin and tehran , which are now assessing the outcome of friday 's meeting . iran has been subject to more than two years of investigations by the international atomic energy agency , which has discovered plenty of suspicious nuclear activity but no " smoking gun " that proves a weapons drive .
the country insists it only wants to generate nuclear power in order to meet increased domestic energy demands and reduce its dependence on oil and gas - a vital source of hard currency . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pressure off in eu-iran nuke showdown an expected showdown in iran-eu nuclear talks friday in london should be more sound than fury as both sides feel the negotiations are basically on hold until after iranian presidential elections in june , diplomats said .

enough money has been received from international donors to fund work at the court for a " sustained period of time " , the un said in a statement .
the communist regime which ruled from 1975-79 is blamed for the deaths of more than one million people out of an eight million-strong population .
cambodia first sought un funding for the court eight years ago .
un secretary-general kofi annan urged the cambodian to move fast now that the money is in place .
still free there are concerns that the ageing top figures of the murderous regime , who have never been prosecuted , might die before being taken to court .
observers expect the first trials to begin by next year .
the regime , headed by pol pot , persecuted its political opponents as well as minority groups .
they allowed food shortages to kill people by starvation , while others were forced to move from the cities to the countryside , where they died from overwork in labour camps .
pol pot died in 1998 , and only two of his six to 10 former top lieutenants are currently in jail .
the cambodian government and the un had agreed that the setting up of the court could start once pledges sufficient to cover the body 's work for the next three years had been received .
at a donor 's conference last month , un members pledged a total $ 38m , $ 21.6m of which came from japan .
cambodia has allocated $ 13m .
cambodians have never really confronted the horrors of the khmer rouge , the bbc 's asia correspondent , andrew harding , reports .
some observers have questioned whether an expensive tribunal is the answer or whether a broader approach , like south africa 's truth and reconciliation commission , would serve cambodians better .

enough money has been received from international donors to fund work at the court for a " sustained period of time " , the un said in a statement .
the communist regime which ruled from 1975-79 is blamed for the deaths of more than one million people out of an eight million-strong population .
cambodia first sought un funding for the court eight years ago .
un secretary-general kofi annan urged the cambodian to move fast now that the money is in place .

observers expect the first trials to begin by next year .
the regime , headed by pol pot , persecuted its political opponents as well as minority groups .
they allowed food shortages to kill people by starvation , while others were forced to move from the cities to the countryside , where they died from overwork in labour camps .
pol pot died in 1998 , and only two of his six to 10 former top lieutenants are currently in jail .
the cambodian government and the un had agreed that the setting up of the court could start once pledges sufficient to cover the body 's work for the next three years had been received .
at a donor 's conference last month , un members pledged a total $ 38m , $ 21.6m of which came from japan .
