german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs . " we 're ready to talk about a tax reform , " he said .
" but the loopholes have to be closed as well .

german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany .

british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed .

the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .

in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't . " he said that if the iranians decide not to cooperate , " the good news is that we , the europeans and the international community are more on the same page than we 've ever been . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we wo n't give up reversing themselves ? britain , france and germany are spearheading an effort to persuade iran to renounce suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb in return for trade , technology and security benefits .
they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized .

-lrb- march 5 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.03.2005 niche channels interrupt tv monotony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing over to digital television means more channel surfing digital tv and its expanded array of special interest programming can break up the relentless parade of folk music festivals and reality tv on german television .
but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on . german history buffs will no longer have to sit in the dusty , secluded back corner of the local library or endure relentless commercial breaks when pursuing their pastime .
a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .
" the changeover is happening relatively slowly , " said dreier .

but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on . german history buffs will no longer have to sit in the dusty , secluded back corner of the local library or endure relentless commercial breaks when pursuing their pastime .
a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .

long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .
" the changeover is happening relatively slowly , " said dreier .
" but the people who have the digital television use it quite intensively . " sean sinico for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere pay tv 's about-face three years ago , germany 's only pay television broadcaster was given up for dead .

"
german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs . " we 're ready to talk about a tax reform , " he said .
" but the loopholes have to be closed as well .

" even if growth were to resume over the next few years , germany would have problems bringing unemployment down below the four million mark on average , " said thomas straubhaar , from the hwwa institute in hamburg . holger fahrinkrug at ubs said the new unemployment data could have not only political repercussions in north rhine-westphalia but a deeper psychological impact on the economy .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't .

washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't . " he said that if the iranians decide not to cooperate , " the good news is that we , the europeans and the international community are more on the same page than we 've ever been . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we wo n't give up reversing themselves ? britain , france and germany are spearheading an effort to persuade iran to renounce suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb in return for trade , technology and security benefits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.03.2005 niche channels interrupt tv monotony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing over to digital television means more channel surfing digital tv and its expanded array of special interest programming can break up the relentless parade of folk music festivals and reality tv on german television .
but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on . german history buffs will no longer have to sit in the dusty , secluded back corner of the local library or endure relentless commercial breaks when pursuing their pastime .
a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .
" the changeover is happening relatively slowly , " said dreier .
" but the people who have the digital television use it quite intensively . " sean sinico for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere pay tv 's about-face three years ago , germany 's only pay television broadcaster was given up for dead .

-lrb- march 8 , 2005 -rrb- eu probes germany 's public tv funding european union regulators have warned germany that its funding for public television partly violates eu state aid law and urged it to set up an independent supervisory panel to ensure more transparency .

bulgaria , which is better prepared to join the bloc , was endorsed with 71 to one votes with one abstention . the committee 's backing virtually guarantees that the full 732-member parliament will also approve the country 's entry bids .
the body is set to vote on the subject on april 13 , days ahead of the april 25 signature of a treaty on bulgaria and romania 's accession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner on tuesday , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- urged eu lawmakers to support the membership bids of both bulgaria , which was " reasonably on track " to join the bloc , and romania about which he was " cautiously optimistic . "
romania on the spot urged by rehn in the last eu evaluation to make its justice system more resistant to corruption , the romanian government has been in a race against the clock to do so , and to implement other eu accession criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president traian basescu at deutsche welle this month " the government is fully committed to establishing working laws to combat corruption , " romanian president traian basescu -lrb- photo -rrb- told a press conference in bucharest on wednesday .
" we have pledged to clean up the justice system and reduce the rampant corruption in romania , " he added . the main problems facing romania are how to better use eu funds , restructure party funding , crack down on tax evasion , re-schedule company debts and create conditions suitable for foreign investment .
proving their mettle once the accession treaty is signed , the two countries will be obliged to carry out all reforms agreed with the eu , including fighting corruption , strengthening their legal systems and introducing eu-style state aid rules .
otherwise , their membership could be postponed until 2008 . romania and bulgaria were too slow in enacting democratic and market reforms after the 1989 fall of communism to join the union when eight other ex-communist countries became eu members in may 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania still has work to finish though granted a date to sign the accession treaty and become a member of europe ’ s most exclusive club , the eu has left a back door open in case romania doesn ’ t fulfill all the bloc 's entry criteria .

a pair of 1-0 wins from poland and austria hurt northern ireland 's and wales ' already slim qualification chances .
scoreless spaniards sitting pretty sitting in second place , spain was happy with a scoreless tie against group seven leaders serbia-montenegro .

the belgians had their hands full in 2-1 win over san mario , whose first goal of the campaign cut its goal difference down to -19 .
in europe 's final group it was croatia that took advantage of sweden 's day off to move to the top by beating malta 3-0 .

argentinean appearance nearly certain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentine has been on a role since its february game in germany though still not a guarantee , argentina 's 28 points after a 1-0 win against columbia make a finals spot almost a given .

the decision allegedly allowed hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from eastern europe - mainly ukraine - to abuse the visa system and enter germany between 2000 and 2003 .
" it is in my interest to give evidence as soon as possible , " fischer said in thursday 's edition of the top-selling bild newspaper .
it is alleged that the relaxed rules introduced by fischer 's ministry were abused by ' human traffickers ' who brought ukrainians into germany on tourist visas when in fact most were intending to work in the country or elsewhere in western europe .
women forced into prostitution , drug dealers , workers seeking illegal employment and even suspected terrorists are alleged to have been among those who entered germany . dw-world.de former diplomats turn against fischer several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin .

german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs . " we 're ready to talk about a tax reform , " he said .
" but the loopholes have to be closed as well .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't .

they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized .

they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized . " the eu and iran are tentatively scheduled for more talks in april in geneva and london . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .
-lrb- march 5 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on . german history buffs will no longer have to sit in the dusty , secluded back corner of the local library or endure relentless commercial breaks when pursuing their pastime .
a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .

bulgaria , which is better prepared to join the bloc , was endorsed with 71 to one votes with one abstention . the committee 's backing virtually guarantees that the full 732-member parliament will also approve the country 's entry bids .
the body is set to vote on the subject on april 13 , days ahead of the april 25 signature of a treaty on bulgaria and romania 's accession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner on tuesday , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- urged eu lawmakers to support the membership bids of both bulgaria , which was " reasonably on track " to join the bloc , and romania about which he was " cautiously optimistic . "
romania on the spot urged by rehn in the last eu evaluation to make its justice system more resistant to corruption , the romanian government has been in a race against the clock to do so , and to implement other eu accession criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president traian basescu at deutsche welle this month " the government is fully committed to establishing working laws to combat corruption , " romanian president traian basescu -lrb- photo -rrb- told a press conference in bucharest on wednesday .
" we have pledged to clean up the justice system and reduce the rampant corruption in romania , " he added . the main problems facing romania are how to better use eu funds , restructure party funding , crack down on tax evasion , re-schedule company debts and create conditions suitable for foreign investment .
proving their mettle once the accession treaty is signed , the two countries will be obliged to carry out all reforms agreed with the eu , including fighting corruption , strengthening their legal systems and introducing eu-style state aid rules .
otherwise , their membership could be postponed until 2008 . romania and bulgaria were too slow in enacting democratic and market reforms after the 1989 fall of communism to join the union when eight other ex-communist countries became eu members in may 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania still has work to finish though granted a date to sign the accession treaty and become a member of europe ’ s most exclusive club , the eu has left a back door open in case romania doesn ’ t fulfill all the bloc 's entry criteria .

but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on . german history buffs will no longer have to sit in the dusty , secluded back corner of the local library or endure relentless commercial breaks when pursuing their pastime .
a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .

to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .
" the changeover is happening relatively slowly , " said dreier .

eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .

the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program .

"
german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs . " we 're ready to talk about a tax reform , " he said .
" but the loopholes have to be closed as well .

german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs .

looking on the bright side , this means that some 41,000 more people had work , compared to february .
weise suggested that the government ’ s labor market reforms were slowly having an impact on the employment situation , but warned against too much optimism . " it ’ s the first time since the restructuring of the employment agencies that unemployment figures went down in absolute numbers , " he said .
" this in itself is an achievement , as we had expected the number of jobless people to rise further in march because of a changed statistical approach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement economics minister wolfgang clement argued that the drop in unemployment would have been much more tangible had the winter not lasted as long as it did , preventing some industries from hiring additional seasonal workers . " the tide is turning , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we are convinced that we will return under the five million mark in the spring and we will never reach this level again in the future . " post-war highs since coming to power in 1998 , schröder and his centre-left government have been unable rein in unemployment , which has since then risen from more than four million to its current post-world war ii record highs . following a string of successive state election defeats , schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are now facing a massive test at the ballot box on may 22 , when the country 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , goes to the polls . some experts are sceptical that any real improvement is likely in the next few years , let alone in the weeks ahead of the state poll , where failure would bode ill for the general election next year .

but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on . german history buffs will no longer have to sit in the dusty , secluded back corner of the local library or endure relentless commercial breaks when pursuing their pastime .
a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .

a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .

bulgaria , which is better prepared to join the bloc , was endorsed with 71 to one votes with one abstention . the committee 's backing virtually guarantees that the full 732-member parliament will also approve the country 's entry bids .
the body is set to vote on the subject on april 13 , days ahead of the april 25 signature of a treaty on bulgaria and romania 's accession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner on tuesday , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- urged eu lawmakers to support the membership bids of both bulgaria , which was " reasonably on track " to join the bloc , and romania about which he was " cautiously optimistic .

" we have pledged to clean up the justice system and reduce the rampant corruption in romania , " he added . the main problems facing romania are how to better use eu funds , restructure party funding , crack down on tax evasion , re-schedule company debts and create conditions suitable for foreign investment .
proving their mettle once the accession treaty is signed , the two countries will be obliged to carry out all reforms agreed with the eu , including fighting corruption , strengthening their legal systems and introducing eu-style state aid rules .
otherwise , their membership could be postponed until 2008 . romania and bulgaria were too slow in enacting democratic and market reforms after the 1989 fall of communism to join the union when eight other ex-communist countries became eu members in may 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania still has work to finish though granted a date to sign the accession treaty and become a member of europe ’ s most exclusive club , the eu has left a back door open in case romania doesn ’ t fulfill all the bloc 's entry criteria .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't . " he said that if the iranians decide not to cooperate , " the good news is that we , the europeans and the international community are more on the same page than we 've ever been . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we wo n't give up reversing themselves ? britain , france and germany are spearheading an effort to persuade iran to renounce suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb in return for trade , technology and security benefits .
they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't .

they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .

german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs . " we 're ready to talk about a tax reform , " he said .
" but the loopholes have to be closed as well . " christine harjes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de searching for jobs in unison following a meeting between the german government and heads of the conservative opposition , chancellor gerhard schröder has called on the latter to suggest ways of financing tax cuts .
-lrb- march 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's labor market losers a new study shows that german companies are fixated on youth and reluctant to hire employees over 50 .
even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end .

"
german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .

bulgaria , which is better prepared to join the bloc , was endorsed with 71 to one votes with one abstention . the committee 's backing virtually guarantees that the full 732-member parliament will also approve the country 's entry bids .
the body is set to vote on the subject on april 13 , days ahead of the april 25 signature of a treaty on bulgaria and romania 's accession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn , eu enlargement commissioner on tuesday , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn -lrb- photo -rrb- urged eu lawmakers to support the membership bids of both bulgaria , which was " reasonably on track " to join the bloc , and romania about which he was " cautiously optimistic . "
romania on the spot urged by rehn in the last eu evaluation to make its justice system more resistant to corruption , the romanian government has been in a race against the clock to do so , and to implement other eu accession criteria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian president traian basescu at deutsche welle this month " the government is fully committed to establishing working laws to combat corruption , " romanian president traian basescu -lrb- photo -rrb- told a press conference in bucharest on wednesday .
" we have pledged to clean up the justice system and reduce the rampant corruption in romania , " he added . the main problems facing romania are how to better use eu funds , restructure party funding , crack down on tax evasion , re-schedule company debts and create conditions suitable for foreign investment .
proving their mettle once the accession treaty is signed , the two countries will be obliged to carry out all reforms agreed with the eu , including fighting corruption , strengthening their legal systems and introducing eu-style state aid rules .
otherwise , their membership could be postponed until 2008 . romania and bulgaria were too slow in enacting democratic and market reforms after the 1989 fall of communism to join the union when eight other ex-communist countries became eu members in may 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania still has work to finish though granted a date to sign the accession treaty and become a member of europe ’ s most exclusive club , the eu has left a back door open in case romania doesn ’ t fulfill all the bloc 's entry criteria .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .

washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran .

looking on the bright side , this means that some 41,000 more people had work , compared to february .
weise suggested that the government ’ s labor market reforms were slowly having an impact on the employment situation , but warned against too much optimism . " it ’ s the first time since the restructuring of the employment agencies that unemployment figures went down in absolute numbers , " he said .
" this in itself is an achievement , as we had expected the number of jobless people to rise further in march because of a changed statistical approach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement economics minister wolfgang clement argued that the drop in unemployment would have been much more tangible had the winter not lasted as long as it did , preventing some industries from hiring additional seasonal workers . " the tide is turning , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we are convinced that we will return under the five million mark in the spring and we will never reach this level again in the future . " post-war highs since coming to power in 1998 , schröder and his centre-left government have been unable rein in unemployment , which has since then risen from more than four million to its current post-world war ii record highs . following a string of successive state election defeats , schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are now facing a massive test at the ballot box on may 22 , when the country 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , goes to the polls . some experts are sceptical that any real improvement is likely in the next few years , let alone in the weeks ahead of the state poll , where failure would bode ill for the general election next year . " even if growth were to resume over the next few years , germany would have problems bringing unemployment down below the four million mark on average , " said thomas straubhaar , from the hwwa institute in hamburg . holger fahrinkrug at ubs said the new unemployment data could have not only political repercussions in north rhine-westphalia but a deeper psychological impact on the economy . " consumer confidence is already adversely affected .
business confidence may also be affected as demand could suffer from precautionary saving in reaction to this , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's job market lessons for germany german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .

german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.03.2005 niche channels interrupt tv monotony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing over to digital television means more channel surfing digital tv and its expanded array of special interest programming can break up the relentless parade of folk music festivals and reality tv on german television .
but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on . german history buffs will no longer have to sit in the dusty , secluded back corner of the local library or endure relentless commercial breaks when pursuing their pastime .
a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .

looking on the bright side , this means that some 41,000 more people had work , compared to february .
weise suggested that the government ’ s labor market reforms were slowly having an impact on the employment situation , but warned against too much optimism . " it ’ s the first time since the restructuring of the employment agencies that unemployment figures went down in absolute numbers , " he said .
" this in itself is an achievement , as we had expected the number of jobless people to rise further in march because of a changed statistical approach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement economics minister wolfgang clement argued that the drop in unemployment would have been much more tangible had the winter not lasted as long as it did , preventing some industries from hiring additional seasonal workers . " the tide is turning , " he told reporters in berlin .
" we are convinced that we will return under the five million mark in the spring and we will never reach this level again in the future . " post-war highs since coming to power in 1998 , schröder and his centre-left government have been unable rein in unemployment , which has since then risen from more than four million to its current post-world war ii record highs . following a string of successive state election defeats , schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are now facing a massive test at the ballot box on may 22 , when the country 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , goes to the polls . some experts are sceptical that any real improvement is likely in the next few years , let alone in the weeks ahead of the state poll , where failure would bode ill for the general election next year . " even if growth were to resume over the next few years , germany would have problems bringing unemployment down below the four million mark on average , " said thomas straubhaar , from the hwwa institute in hamburg . holger fahrinkrug at ubs said the new unemployment data could have not only political repercussions in north rhine-westphalia but a deeper psychological impact on the economy . " consumer confidence is already adversely affected .
business confidence may also be affected as demand could suffer from precautionary saving in reaction to this , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's job market lessons for germany german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . -lrb- march 31 , 2005 -rrb- schröder : time for industry to act chancellor gerhard schröder took a swipe at business leaders over the weekend , telling them the government had done its part to rejuvenate the economy , now it 's time for industry to step up to the plate and create jobs .

bulgaria , which is better prepared to join the bloc , was endorsed with 71 to one votes with one abstention . the committee 's backing virtually guarantees that the full 732-member parliament will also approve the country 's entry bids .

" we have pledged to clean up the justice system and reduce the rampant corruption in romania , " he added . the main problems facing romania are how to better use eu funds , restructure party funding , crack down on tax evasion , re-schedule company debts and create conditions suitable for foreign investment .
proving their mettle once the accession treaty is signed , the two countries will be obliged to carry out all reforms agreed with the eu , including fighting corruption , strengthening their legal systems and introducing eu-style state aid rules .
otherwise , their membership could be postponed until 2008 . romania and bulgaria were too slow in enacting democratic and market reforms after the 1989 fall of communism to join the union when eight other ex-communist countries became eu members in may 2004 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romania still has work to finish though granted a date to sign the accession treaty and become a member of europe ’ s most exclusive club , the eu has left a back door open in case romania doesn ’ t fulfill all the bloc 's entry criteria .

so far germany is the only european team sure of spot next summer . as hosts , germany do not need to worry about point races or goal difference to qualify for the world cup , but the rest of the world is getting out the calculators and crunching how many more points they need for a trip to germany after wednesday night 's preliminary matches .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were seven yellow cards in the match between ukraine and holland seven yellow cards dotted a physical match between ukraine and denmark .

he used it to france 's benefit when he put in the game 's first goal , but to their detriment when he was sent off after head butting an israeli defender five minutes later .
cyprus kept switzerland to a scoreless draw until the 88th minute when a swiss goal put the alpine nation into third place , a point behind france and israel with a game in hand .

norway 's failure to beat moldova and the 1-1 tie between slovenia and belarus secured the azzurri 's lead at the top of the table before their next qualifier in norway this june .
calls for a double-digit goals were left unanswered as england , still atop group six , managed to scratch out a 2-0 second-half win against azerbaijan , who were pounded 8-0 by poland earlier this week .
a pair of 1-0 wins from poland and austria hurt northern ireland 's and wales ' already slim qualification chances .
scoreless spaniards sitting pretty sitting in second place , spain was happy with a scoreless tie against group seven leaders serbia-montenegro .
lithuania 's 1-1 draw in bosnia-herzegovina on the other hand was a riddled with missed opportunities to draw closer to the leaders .
but belgium is there to share lithuania 's misery .
the belgians had their hands full in 2-1 win over san mario , whose first goal of the campaign cut its goal difference down to -19 .
in europe 's final group it was croatia that took advantage of sweden 's day off to move to the top by beating malta 3-0 .
in the group 's other game , hungary scored a last minute goal to share points with bulgaria .
argentinean appearance nearly certain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentine has been on a role since its february game in germany though still not a guarantee , argentina 's 28 points after a 1-0 win against columbia make a finals spot almost a given .
world champions brazil gratefully used a breakdown in uruguay 's defense to share points while uruguay suffered its second frustrating disappointment in a week .
paraguay came back from a 5-2 defeat in ecuador with a 2-1 triumph over chile , continuing their course toward a third successive world cup .
in north america , the united states dominated guatemala 2-0 while mexico tied panama .
cape verde carries on unlikely fight the asian teams ' qualifying campaigns returned to soccer as usual after rioting marred matches earlier in week when the crowd got out of hand , killing five fans and injuring 40 more after iran beat japan 2-1 in tehran .
the favorites sides all took three points when korea , japan and iran won .
ranked 129th in the world , the cape verde islands continued their improbable bid for a place in germany with 2-1 win against burkina faso last weekend .

looking on the bright side , this means that some 41,000 more people had work , compared to february .
weise suggested that the government ’ s labor market reforms were slowly having an impact on the employment situation , but warned against too much optimism . " it ’ s the first time since the restructuring of the employment agencies that unemployment figures went down in absolute numbers , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.03.2005 niche channels interrupt tv monotony großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing over to digital television means more channel surfing digital tv and its expanded array of special interest programming can break up the relentless parade of folk music festivals and reality tv on german television .
but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on . german history buffs will no longer have to sit in the dusty , secluded back corner of the local library or endure relentless commercial breaks when pursuing their pastime .
a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .
" the changeover is happening relatively slowly , " said dreier .
" but the people who have the digital television use it quite intensively . " sean sinico for dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere pay tv 's about-face three years ago , germany 's only pay television broadcaster was given up for dead .

a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .
about 73 percent of germans above the age of three watch some television every day , and the average tv is on for 200 minutes daily , according to research from munich 's institute for communications science and media research .
some people who switched were forced to when the areas they lived in cut analog broadcasts , but others changed to receive particular programs , premiere spokeswoman anja knigge said .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we wo n't give up reversing themselves ? britain , france and germany are spearheading an effort to persuade iran to renounce suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb in return for trade , technology and security benefits .
they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized .

german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed .

the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs .

"
german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs . " we 're ready to talk about a tax reform , " he said .
" but the loopholes have to be closed as well . " christine harjes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de searching for jobs in unison following a meeting between the german government and heads of the conservative opposition , chancellor gerhard schröder has called on the latter to suggest ways of financing tax cuts .

" even if growth were to resume over the next few years , germany would have problems bringing unemployment down below the four million mark on average , " said thomas straubhaar , from the hwwa institute in hamburg . holger fahrinkrug at ubs said the new unemployment data could have not only political repercussions in north rhine-westphalia but a deeper psychological impact on the economy .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't . " he said that if the iranians decide not to cooperate , " the good news is that we , the europeans and the international community are more on the same page than we 've ever been . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we wo n't give up reversing themselves ? britain , france and germany are spearheading an effort to persuade iran to renounce suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb in return for trade , technology and security benefits .
they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized . " the eu and iran are tentatively scheduled for more talks in april in geneva and london . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .
-lrb- march 5 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .

washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran .

the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized .

so far germany is the only european team sure of spot next summer . as hosts , germany do not need to worry about point races or goal difference to qualify for the world cup , but the rest of the world is getting out the calculators and crunching how many more points they need for a trip to germany after wednesday night 's preliminary matches .
holland , the czech republic and romania all won and made sure group one stayed close , three points separate the top three teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were seven yellow cards in the match between ukraine and holland seven yellow cards dotted a physical match between ukraine and denmark .
the 1-0 loss probably spells the end of the danes march to germany , while keeping ukraine three points ahead of european champion greece , who finished with a 2-0 lead against albania .
france struggles , italy sails france is stuck in a three-way draw at the top of its group after conceding a draw at home , their third in a row , against israel .
much of the night 's action had something to with frenchman david trezeguet 's head .
he used it to france 's benefit when he put in the game 's first goal , but to their detriment when he was sent off after head butting an israeli defender five minutes later .
cyprus kept switzerland to a scoreless draw until the 88th minute when a swiss goal put the alpine nation into third place , a point behind france and israel with a game in hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy did n't even need to play in order to secure their lead even without playing , italy was the big winner in group five .
norway 's failure to beat moldova and the 1-1 tie between slovenia and belarus secured the azzurri 's lead at the top of the table before their next qualifier in norway this june .
calls for a double-digit goals were left unanswered as england , still atop group six , managed to scratch out a 2-0 second-half win against azerbaijan , who were pounded 8-0 by poland earlier this week .
a pair of 1-0 wins from poland and austria hurt northern ireland 's and wales ' already slim qualification chances .
scoreless spaniards sitting pretty sitting in second place , spain was happy with a scoreless tie against group seven leaders serbia-montenegro .
lithuania 's 1-1 draw in bosnia-herzegovina on the other hand was a riddled with missed opportunities to draw closer to the leaders .
but belgium is there to share lithuania 's misery .
the belgians had their hands full in 2-1 win over san mario , whose first goal of the campaign cut its goal difference down to -19 .
in europe 's final group it was croatia that took advantage of sweden 's day off to move to the top by beating malta 3-0 .
in the group 's other game , hungary scored a last minute goal to share points with bulgaria .
argentinean appearance nearly certain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentine has been on a role since its february game in germany though still not a guarantee , argentina 's 28 points after a 1-0 win against columbia make a finals spot almost a given .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't . " he said that if the iranians decide not to cooperate , " the good news is that we , the europeans and the international community are more on the same page than we 've ever been . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we wo n't give up reversing themselves ? britain , france and germany are spearheading an effort to persuade iran to renounce suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb in return for trade , technology and security benefits .
they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized . " the eu and iran are tentatively scheduled for more talks in april in geneva and london . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .
-lrb- march 5 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

" even if growth were to resume over the next few years , germany would have problems bringing unemployment down below the four million mark on average , " said thomas straubhaar , from the hwwa institute in hamburg . holger fahrinkrug at ubs said the new unemployment data could have not only political repercussions in north rhine-westphalia but a deeper psychological impact on the economy .

german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed .

" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs .

so far germany is the only european team sure of spot next summer . as hosts , germany do not need to worry about point races or goal difference to qualify for the world cup , but the rest of the world is getting out the calculators and crunching how many more points they need for a trip to germany after wednesday night 's preliminary matches .
holland , the czech republic and romania all won and made sure group one stayed close , three points separate the top three teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were seven yellow cards in the match between ukraine and holland seven yellow cards dotted a physical match between ukraine and denmark .
the 1-0 loss probably spells the end of the danes march to germany , while keeping ukraine three points ahead of european champion greece , who finished with a 2-0 lead against albania .
france struggles , italy sails france is stuck in a three-way draw at the top of its group after conceding a draw at home , their third in a row , against israel .
much of the night 's action had something to with frenchman david trezeguet 's head .
he used it to france 's benefit when he put in the game 's first goal , but to their detriment when he was sent off after head butting an israeli defender five minutes later .
cyprus kept switzerland to a scoreless draw until the 88th minute when a swiss goal put the alpine nation into third place , a point behind france and israel with a game in hand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy did n't even need to play in order to secure their lead even without playing , italy was the big winner in group five .
norway 's failure to beat moldova and the 1-1 tie between slovenia and belarus secured the azzurri 's lead at the top of the table before their next qualifier in norway this june .

a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .

ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .

but barely 20 percent of germans choose to turn it on . german history buffs will no longer have to sit in the dusty , secluded back corner of the local library or endure relentless commercial breaks when pursuing their pastime .
a new tv channel , discovery geschichte -lrb- history -rrb- catering to enthusiasts of the past starts thursday on german pay tv provider premiere .
the new station is part of a continuing trend toward niche programming in germany .
long available in other countries , special interest channels like the food channel , the weather channel and home and garden tv have taken a long time to find acceptance in the german market , partly due to the limited bandwidth state regulators make available to them .
" there are more programmers than space , " said hardy dreier of the hans-bredow institute for media research at the university of hamburg .
" limited space means specialized channels have worse chances for approval than general programs . "
when three channels were enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even with more channels , sometimes there 's only one thing on the television-watching public in germany was long satisfied with just two national and one local broadcaster until the emergence of private stations in the mid-80s .
now digital television in many german cities , means that viewers have more choice than simply turning the tv on or off .
digital tv makes it possible to receive a larger array of special interest channels by squeezing more information into the same amount of bandwidth used by analog programming and is available via satellite , cable or antenna .
" people can target their viewing much better now , " said alexandra schwarz , a spokeswoman for kabel deutschland , germany 's largest cable tv provider .
" they can pick the shows they want to watch instead of randomly being told . "
while the trend toward theme channels , which usually need to be purchased in addition to the free public and commercial stations , continues , it is difficult for them to find a large market because television has become more about entertainment than education , according to klaus melle of the institute for communications science and media research in munich .
" if television media were to stay the way it is now , free to air programming would probably be enough for most people , " dreier added .
if , however , entertainment programming like sports and films from free-to-air channels prosiebensat1 and rtl moved to pay tv , many people , particularly those with high-end entertainment systems , would be willing to fork out a little extra for the chance to watch , dreiser explained .
digital tv enables theme programming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere is germany 's only pay tv provider the 31 channels premiere brings its 3.5 million subscribers are n't consumers ' only way to escape the largely bland daytime soaps and reruns that fill german broadcast television .
to prevent people from getting bored while zapping on the sofa , kabel deutschland has also offered 31 niche channels , including the history channel and national geographic , on top of the regular public and commercial channels in its special digital cable package on offer since may 2004 .
ses astra , the country 's largest satellite operator , offers digital reception with a choice of over 200 channels , though less than a third of satellite owners use digital receivers and are thus limited to a mix of 46 publicly and privately financed analog channels .
germans slow in digital uptake while the german government has committed to switching completely over to digital television by 2010 , some areas including berlin and hamburg already have , only about 20 percent of german households have changed over , according to a february study from the tns media research group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans with digital tv receive it via satellite currently , two million receive digital cable , another seven million get digital reception via satellite and 600,000 use digital antennas , the tns study said .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't . " he said that if the iranians decide not to cooperate , " the good news is that we , the europeans and the international community are more on the same page than we 've ever been . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we wo n't give up reversing themselves ? britain , france and germany are spearheading an effort to persuade iran to renounce suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb in return for trade , technology and security benefits .
they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized . " the eu and iran are tentatively scheduled for more talks in april in geneva and london . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .
-lrb- march 5 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

"
german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs . " we 're ready to talk about a tax reform , " he said .
" but the loopholes have to be closed as well . " christine harjes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de searching for jobs in unison following a meeting between the german government and heads of the conservative opposition , chancellor gerhard schröder has called on the latter to suggest ways of financing tax cuts .
-lrb- march 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's labor market losers a new study shows that german companies are fixated on youth and reluctant to hire employees over 50 .
even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end .
-lrb- march 9 , 2005 -rrb- five million germans jobless germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .

are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out . france , britain and germany are mulling over a compromise that would allow iran to keep nuclear technology that can be used to make bombs , diplomats told reuters wednesday .
" the iranians have been offering this for a long time , " a diplomat with access to the negotiations told the news agency .
" what 's new is that the eu is thinking about it . " but us officials dismissed any such move wednesday , saying that a compromise of this kind is not on the table .
the us flatly rejected tehran 's offer to conduct limited uranium enrichment activities and challenged the country to prove it was serious in talks on its suspected nuclear weapons program . " we and the eu-3 remain united in the view that only a full cessation and dismantling of iran 's sensitive nuclear fuel cycle pursuits can provide the kind of confidence we 're looking for that iran has abandoned its nuclear weapons program , " deputy state department spokesman adam ereli told afp .
he refused to discuss whether the european-led talks were making progress in reining in iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but the tone of his remarks was far from upbeat . " we 're trying to achieve something , " ereli said .
" have we achieved it today ?
no , we have n't .
and do n't ask me to assess the likelihood of achieving it tomorrow because i ca n't . " he said that if the iranians decide not to cooperate , " the good news is that we , the europeans and the international community are more on the same page than we 've ever been . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we wo n't give up reversing themselves ? britain , france and germany are spearheading an effort to persuade iran to renounce suspected efforts to develop a nuclear bomb in return for trade , technology and security benefits .
they have previously taken the stance that only a complete dismantling of iran 's nuclear program would be acceptable . the united states joined the european effort to try to wean iran off its nuclear hopes after earlier pushing to take the matter before the united nations in a bid to apply pressure through possible sanctions .
washington has also not ruled out using force . a senior state department official , who asked not to be named , said the administration was determined to give the europeans all the time they thought they needed to play out the negotiations with iran . " i would say these talks have not yet produced the end of their program , but the europeans are continuing to engage and we 'll let them decide when they think they 're no longer useful , " he said . nuclear activities peaceful , tehran says tehran has said it will not give up its technology and that its nuclear activities are peaceful . and on wednesday , iranian president mohammad khatami took reporters on an unprecedented tour of the islamic republic 's closely guarded nuclear sites and vowed never to abandon its drive to enrich uranium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromise is not on the table , us says " come clean , " us warns " our response , " ereli said , " is that if iran were really serious about demonstrating transparency in its nuclear program , it should answer all of the international atomic energy agency 's outstanding questions … .and stop denying iaea full and unrestricted access to suspicious sites .
the point here is that if there is a commitment to transparency , there are real , effective , meaningful ways to demonstrate that commitment , beyond a staged media event like is being reported . " he called on iran allow key nuclear officials to be interviewed by the iaea and to come clean about its centrifuge program to enrich uranium as well as past efforts to extract plutonium as potential nuclear fuel . he said the iranians had a choice : " either make decisions that are characteristic of a responsible member of the international community , or find yourself further isolated and further ostracized . " the eu and iran are tentatively scheduled for more talks in april in geneva and london . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .
-lrb- march 5 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

"
german unemployment fell slightly in march , officials said thursday .
but the country still lacks millions of jobs .
britain and the netherlands might offer some ideas on how to deal with the problem . a " job miracle " seems to have taken place in britain during the past 10 to 15 years .
while the unemployment rate was still more than 10 percent in 1993 , that number sank to 4.7 percent by 2004 .
the united kingdom managed to cut unemployment in half , in other words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things look quite different in germany : while the federal labor office announced thursday that unemployment had dropped slightly in march , 5.176 million people still remain without work , resulting in an unemployment rate of 12.5 percent . why has britain succeeded where germany has failed ? fewer regulations , more support " if we knew that , we 'd just have to copy them , " said holger schäfer , a job market researcher for the institute of german industry in cologne .
" but basically , there are fewer regulations in britain than in germany . " he added that the british government has merged unemployment and social welfare payments and reduced unemployment money - a step recently taken by the german government with the introduction of sweeping welfare reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but schäfer also pointed to a major difference between the two systems : while britain has long been able to rely on a powerful service sector , germany still needs to deal with an overblown building industry . britain 's so-called " activation strategy " also played a role in getting people back on the job market , according to ingo kolf , a job market expert with the german trade union federation .
british job center agents are responsible for fewer clients than their german counterparts , allowing them to spend more time with people . " that 's where we can still learn something from britain , " kolf said , adding that he 's not too hot on the british model in general . fudged numbers ? " you can not compare british and german unemployment figures , " he said .
" the number of people that have withdrawn from the job market is twice as high as the number of people that are officially unemployed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when adding the numbers , about 2.5 million people are actually without a job in britain , kolf said .
" that 's not that different from germany . " the situation in the netherlands is quite similar , kolf said .
the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent , but even if the actual situation is worse , germans can learn something from their neighbors . a need for flexibility " people have to become more flexible , " he said , adding that 40 percent of jobs in the netherlands are part-time and temp work is booming .
the latter sector has long been decried in germany for destroying regular jobs .
but for the past two years , temp agencies have had to adhere to collective labor agreements and are slowly losing their bad image . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam canal the fact that dutch workers are more willing to agree to a wage reduction plays a large role in explaining the country 's success , according to schäfer from the institute of german industry .
in 2003 , dutch unions agreed to forego wage increases while the government took back social welfare cuts .
the union 's willingness to cooperate worked wonders for the dutch job market , schäfer said . " labor is simply too expensive in germany , " he added .
while productivity remains relatively high , other countries are beginning to catch up , making it harder for companies to justify higher production costs in germany . lowering social security contributions could be a positive signal , schäfer said . lower taxes , fewer loopholes " germany 's labor law also needs to be cleared up and lowering corporate taxes could help as well , " he added . while union officials would n't back these demands , they agree that something needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedestrians in berlin " the tax-social security payments ratio is out of sync in germany , " said markus franz , a spokesman for the german trade union federation , adding that germany 's tax rate is effectively the lowest in europe due to a vast number of ways to claim tax write-offs . " we 're ready to talk about a tax reform , " he said .
" but the loopholes have to be closed as well . " christine harjes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : searching for jobs in unison following a meeting between the german government and heads of the conservative opposition , chancellor gerhard schröder has called on the latter to suggest ways of financing tax cuts .
-lrb- march 18 , 2005 -rrb- dw-world : germany 's labor market losers a new study shows that german companies are fixated on youth and reluctant to hire employees over 50 .
even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end .
-lrb- march 9 , 2005 -rrb- dw-world : five million germans jobless germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .

while the debate rages in scotland over the planned introduction of a smoking ban next year , the republic of ireland has reached a one-year smoke-free milestone .
the effects of which i witnessed first-hand after deciding to forego a usual weekend spent in the bars and clubs of glasgow for a visit to dublin to catch up with friends .
the trip was only my second visit to the emerald isle following a few days spent enjoying the craic in galway in 2003 .
it was my first venture across the irish sea since the controversial smoking restrictions were put in place .
being a non-smoker , i was curiously looking forward to seeing how different things would be .
would the bars be quieter with less of an atmosphere ?
would the air be noticeably different ?
and how was my friend karen , an enthusiastic consumer of the silk cut brand , coping after moving to ireland shortly after the ban was put in place ?
' thick with smoke ' truth be told , i did n't even notice the change at first .
and no , my lack of observation was n't down to over-consumption of guinness , as one colleague cheekily suggested .
first port of call after a short flight from the west of scotland to the east of ireland was keogh 's bar , a famous old watering-hole off grafton street in the centre of dublin .
it was busy and bustling with the just-finished-work-and-it 's-friday crowd .
caught up in catching up , the fact it was cigarette-free completely passed me by until karen stood up .
" your round ? "
i enquired innocently ?
" nah , " she replied .
" i 'm off outside , " picking up her handbag .
my blank expression resulted in eye-rolling exasperation and an additional " ... for a cig " comment was thrown at me as she disappeared out the door .
sitting there on my own , i started to properly take in the scene around me .
workers chewing the fat over a pint , couples sitting side-by-side and friends laughing by the bar .
it could have been any bar in any city , but for one difference - no-one was smoking .
the air used to be thick with smoke , so the regulars told me - some with wistful affection - and they had mixed views on whether the ban was a good idea .
" i miss being able to smoke in a pub , " said one .
" the guinness tastes different without having a cigarette to go with it . "
but his friend piped up : " it 's actually a good way to meet people .
i chatted up my current girlfriend while we were both standing outside a pub having a cigarette . "
fresh air it was n't until the dreaded morning after that i noticed the biggest difference .
my clothes from the night before did n't stink of stale tobacco and my hair was surprisingly smoke-free .
my throat certainly did n't feel as scratchy as it has done after a night out in glasgow and i swear my head was n't as " fuzzy " either .
sampling the smoking ban in dublin certainly set me thinking .
on one hand it seems strange that government legislation will soon affect a night out with friends in a new way , but maybe the trumpeted health benefits really will make it all worthwhile .
back in glasgow a week later and out on the town celebrating a friend 's birthday , the smokey atmosphere in a city bar was as noticeable as the fresh atmosphere in dublin had been unnoticeable .
and tobacco-tainted clothes and hair the morning after followed the traditional sore throat and itchy eyes from the night before .
my friends at home are still aghast at the thought of having to pop outside to the street for a puff between drinks , but after my irish break i find myself open-minded about scotland 's version of the ban being introduced in 2006 .
and dublin-based karen is philosophical after 12 months living as a smoker in a " no-smoking city " .
" it 's like the euro , " she says .
" you just get used to it . "

the effects of which i witnessed first-hand after deciding to forego a usual weekend spent in the bars and clubs of glasgow for a visit to dublin to catch up with friends .
the trip was only my second visit to the emerald isle following a few days spent enjoying the craic in galway in 2003 .
it was my first venture across the irish sea since the controversial smoking restrictions were put in place .
being a non-smoker , i was curiously looking forward to seeing how different things would be .
would the bars be quieter with less of an atmosphere ?
would the air be noticeably different ?
and how was my friend karen , an enthusiastic consumer of the silk cut brand , coping after moving to ireland shortly after the ban was put in place ?
' thick with smoke ' truth be told , i did n't even notice the change at first .
and no , my lack of observation was n't down to over-consumption of guinness , as one colleague cheekily suggested .
first port of call after a short flight from the west of scotland to the east of ireland was keogh 's bar , a famous old watering-hole off grafton street in the centre of dublin .
it was busy and bustling with the just-finished-work-and-it 's-friday crowd .
caught up in catching up , the fact it was cigarette-free completely passed me by until karen stood up .

it could have been any bar in any city , but for one difference - no-one was smoking .
the air used to be thick with smoke , so the regulars told me - some with wistful affection - and they had mixed views on whether the ban was a good idea .

i chatted up my current girlfriend while we were both standing outside a pub having a cigarette . "

my clothes from the night before did n't stink of stale tobacco and my hair was surprisingly smoke-free .
my throat certainly did n't feel as scratchy as it has done after a night out in glasgow and i swear my head was n't as " fuzzy " either .
glasgow 's patrons will soon face smoking restrictions sampling the smoking ban in dublin certainly set me thinking .
on one hand it seems strange that government legislation will soon affect a night out with friends in a new way , but maybe the trumpeted health benefits really will make it all worthwhile .
back in glasgow a week later and out on the town celebrating a friend 's birthday , the smokey atmosphere in a city bar was as noticeable as the fresh atmosphere in dublin had been unnoticeable .
and tobacco-tainted clothes and hair the morning after followed the traditional sore throat and itchy eyes from the night before .

the effects of which i witnessed first-hand after deciding to forego a usual weekend spent in the bars and clubs of glasgow for a visit to dublin to catch up with friends .
the trip was only my second visit to the emerald isle following a few days spent enjoying the craic in galway in 2003 .
it was my first venture across the irish sea since the controversial smoking restrictions were put in place .
being a non-smoker , i was curiously looking forward to seeing how different things would be .
would the bars be quieter with less of an atmosphere ?
would the air be noticeably different ?
and how was my friend karen , an enthusiastic consumer of the silk cut brand , coping after moving to ireland shortly after the ban was put in place ?
' thick with smoke ' truth be told , i did n't even notice the change at first .
and no , my lack of observation was n't down to over-consumption of guinness , as one colleague cheekily suggested .
first port of call after a short flight from the west of scotland to the east of ireland was keogh 's bar , a famous old watering-hole off grafton street in the centre of dublin .
it was busy and bustling with the just-finished-work-and-it 's-friday crowd .
caught up in catching up , the fact it was cigarette-free completely passed me by until karen stood up .
" your round ? "
i enquired innocently ?
" nah , " she replied .
" i 'm off outside , " picking up her handbag .
my blank expression resulted in eye-rolling exasperation and an additional " ... for a cig " comment was thrown at me as she disappeared out the door .
some drinkers say the smoking ban makes drinks taste different sitting there on my own , i started to properly take in the scene around me .
workers chewing the fat over a pint , couples sitting side-by-side and friends laughing by the bar .
it could have been any bar in any city , but for one difference - no-one was smoking .
the air used to be thick with smoke , so the regulars told me - some with wistful affection - and they had mixed views on whether the ban was a good idea .
" i miss being able to smoke in a pub , " said one .
" the guinness tastes different without having a cigarette to go with it . "
but his friend piped up : " it 's actually a good way to meet people .
i chatted up my current girlfriend while we were both standing outside a pub having a cigarette . "
fresh air it was n't until the dreaded morning after that i noticed the biggest difference .
my clothes from the night before did n't stink of stale tobacco and my hair was surprisingly smoke-free .
my throat certainly did n't feel as scratchy as it has done after a night out in glasgow and i swear my head was n't as " fuzzy " either .
glasgow 's patrons will soon face smoking restrictions sampling the smoking ban in dublin certainly set me thinking .
on one hand it seems strange that government legislation will soon affect a night out with friends in a new way , but maybe the trumpeted health benefits really will make it all worthwhile .
back in glasgow a week later and out on the town celebrating a friend 's birthday , the smokey atmosphere in a city bar was as noticeable as the fresh atmosphere in dublin had been unnoticeable .
and tobacco-tainted clothes and hair the morning after followed the traditional sore throat and itchy eyes from the night before .
my friends at home are still aghast at the thought of having to pop outside to the street for a puff between drinks , but after my irish break i find myself open-minded about scotland 's version of the ban being introduced in 2006 .
and dublin-based karen is philosophical after 12 months living as a smoker in a " no-smoking city " .
" it 's like the euro , " she says .
" you just get used to it . "

information about suspected deliberate and unlawful killings is among a new assembly government system to track serious patient safety incidents .
in almost two years up to december 2004 , 331 reports were made , with 200 deaths ; 111 of these suspected suicide .
but a spokeswoman said the figures were " not particularly high " .
the system of recording serious incidents involving patient safety started after a study in england found the nhs was poor at learning lessons when mistakes were made . "
a patient safety incident is defined as : ' any event or circumstance arising during nhs funded care that could have or did lead to unintended or unexpected harm , loss or damage ... " '
assembly government document amongst the welsh figures for suspected homicide is the case of paul khan , a psychiatric patient being treated in the community who was jailed for life for stabbing a stranger to death .
however , not all the cases reported under the new system were substantiated by further investigation .
an example of this was a " suspected homicide " recorded from the bodawen nursing home in porthmadog .
the former matron , avola humphreys , was later cleared of the manslaughter of a patient after a court heard claims that disgruntled staff had manufactured evidence against her .
as for the other " suspected homicides " , two of the nine are still being investigated by the police , and the assembly government said these had been recorded because the accused had some history of mental illness , although this may not have been a factor .
incidents reported under the new system also include mistakes involving the wrong patient or body part , instruments being left inside people after surgery and errors over medication .
reported serious incidents suspected homicides - 9 suspected suicides - 111 unexpected death - 80 non-fatal incidents - 131 a welsh assembly government spokeswoman said it expected overall figures to rise in the short term as more people were encouraged to report incidents .
" it is hoped in the future there will be a much more open culture for reporting incidents and much more patient involvement in the investigations with the ultimate aim of driving the figures down , " the spokeswoman said .
the assembly government added that the figures were not considered to be particularly high , when research suggested a potential of between 8,500 and 17,000 serious incidents reported in england each year .
the leader of the organisation representing patients ' interests in wales agreed with that view .
" we should all be concerned about serious incidents of this sort and the personal tragedy they represent , " said peter johns , director of the board of community health councils in wales .
" but there are risks in health treatments , " he added .
" and when you consider the total number of people undergoing treatment in a year , the comment about the number not being particularly high is probably not far off the mark . "
mr johns said that the important thing was to see if there was a trend for a reduction of incidents over time .
the figures came in response to a request from the bbc wales news website under the freedom of information act about serious incidents involving patient safety in welsh hospitals .

information about suspected deliberate and unlawful killings is among a new assembly government system to track serious patient safety incidents .
in almost two years up to december 2004 , 331 reports were made , with 200 deaths ; 111 of these suspected suicide .
but a spokeswoman said the figures were " not particularly high " .
the system of recording serious incidents involving patient safety started after a study in england found the nhs was poor at learning lessons when mistakes were made .
a patient safety incident is defined as : ' any event or circumstance arising during nhs funded care that could have or did lead to unintended or unexpected harm , loss or damage ... '
assembly government document amongst the welsh figures for suspected homicide is the case of paul khan , a psychiatric patient being treated in the community who was jailed for life for stabbing a stranger to death .
however , not all the cases reported under the new system were substantiated by further investigation .
an example of this was a " suspected homicide " recorded from the bodawen nursing home in porthmadog .
the former matron , avola humphreys , was later cleared of the manslaughter of a patient after a court heard claims that disgruntled staff had manufactured evidence against her .
as for the other " suspected homicides " , two of the nine are still being investigated by the police , and the assembly government said these had been recorded because the accused had some history of mental illness , although this may not have been a factor .
incidents reported under the new system also include mistakes involving the wrong patient or body part , instruments being left inside people after surgery and errors over medication .
reported serious incidents suspected homicides - 9 suspected suicides - 111 unexpected death - 80 non-fatal incidents - 131 a welsh assembly government spokeswoman said it expected overall figures to rise in the short term as more people were encouraged to report incidents .
" it is hoped in the future there will be a much more open culture for reporting incidents and much more patient involvement in the investigations with the ultimate aim of driving the figures down , " the spokeswoman said .
the assembly government added that the figures were not considered to be particularly high , when research suggested a potential of between 8,500 and 17,000 serious incidents reported in england each year .
the leader of the organisation representing patients ' interests in wales agreed with that view .
" we should all be concerned about serious incidents of this sort and the personal tragedy they represent , " said peter johns , director of the board of community health councils in wales .
" but there are risks in health treatments , " he added .
" and when you consider the total number of people undergoing treatment in a year , the comment about the number not being particularly high is probably not far off the mark . "
mr johns said that the important thing was to see if there was a trend for a reduction of incidents over time .
the figures came in response to a request from the bbc wales news website under the freedom of information act about serious incidents involving patient safety in welsh hospitals .

the ifs says income after tax and benefits fell by 0.2 % between 2003 and 2004 , due partly to rises in national insurance payments in the 2002 budget .
but the ifs says the incomes of the poorest people in britain grew between 2003 and 2004 , partly because of new , more generous tax credits .
in response , the treasury described the ifs research as " complete rubbish " .
gap shrinking the ifs analysis of official government figures concluded that average incomes fell from £ 409 to £ 408 a week .
the self-employed and high earners suffered the biggest income falls , according to the ifs .
the incomes of the richest fifth of households fell by about 1 % . "
the ifs analysis is complete rubbish - these figures show that since 1997 , reported average take-home incomes have risen by almost 20 % in real terms " treasury but the ifs said that the incomes of the poorest fifth of households rose by about 1 % .
as a result , overall , the gap between britain 's rich and poor shrank for the third successive year .
" the incomes of poorer households were boosted by new and more generous tax credits , while the better off were hit by rises in income tax , national insurance and council tax , " said andrew shepherd , an ifs researcher .
" not surprisingly , the redistributive package has nudged inequality lower although the government can not yet claim that it is definitely on a downward trend . "
the ifs said that the drop in take-home income was due to a combination of national insurance rises and the freezing of income tax personal allowances in the 2002 budget .
self-employed the treasury was quick to criticise the ifs analysis .
a treasury spokesman said the 0.2 % drop could be explained in a number of ways .
the most significant was the large drop in take-home incomes reported by self-employed individuals whose profits were hit by worldwide economic slowdown .
incomes would have actually risen by 1.8 % if that group was discounted , the treasury added .
" the ifs analysis is complete rubbish , " a treasury spokesman said .
" these figures show that since 1997 , reported average take-home incomes have risen by almost 20 % in real terms and are rising again this year thanks to the maintenance of stable economic growth . "
