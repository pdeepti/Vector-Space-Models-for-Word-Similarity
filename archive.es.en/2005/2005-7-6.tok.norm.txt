the demonstrators were later chased off . the majority of the 3,000 people on the march stuck to the agreed route through the village of auchterarder , rallying at a point some 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- away from the summit site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are dragged by police from the a9 motorway near gleneagles , scotland , wednesday , july , 6 , 2005 .
they were blocked by a wire fence and lines of riot police - some of them on horseback - guarding the posh gleneagles resort , the venue of the three-day summit that began wednesday . demonstrators hoisted two large banners , one of them reading " fight poverty , not war , bring the troops home , " and shouted " they say drop bombs , we say drop the debt . " many of the protesters then headed back to the small town of auchterardar , where they had earlier assembled , accompanied by a bagpiper in full highland regalia playing " scotland the brave . " the trouble at the fence broke out on the return trip . " the most violent men on earth today are at gleneagles and they are called the g8 , " controversial british mp george galloway told the crowd ahead of the march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2005 industry criticizes spd election manifesto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business owners were hoping for better news from the chancellor german industry representatives have sharply criticized the election manifesto presented by the social democrats on tuesday , calling it incoherent and unlikely to bring about a much-needed economic upswing . the president of the german association of small and medium-sized businesses -lrb- bvmw -rrb- criticized the spd ’ s plans , saying they would not ensure a sustainable economic recovery .
mario ohoven said he could not relate to the social democrats ’ election manifesto and felt the spd leadership ’ s recent attempts to woo back leftist supporters had resulted in too many amendments to its social and economic reform course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz müntefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections " the spd election manifesto contains too many populist promises , " ohoven said .
" we 've always supported the chancellor ’ s reform agenda , but now we see this agenda being watered down further .
such incoherence won ’ t help us or the spd in the long run . " less bureaucracy ohoven said he wanted the consolidation of the federal budget to remain a top priority .
he added that the government would do well to prune away at the jungle of bureaucratic rules that was making life almost impossible for small and medium-sized firms , which he said are the backbone of the national economy . " each person in a small company spends about 60 hours a year to fill in statistical data sheets in line with state-level or community-level regulations , " ohoven said .
" this is only one example of germany 's rampant bureaucracy .
every labor-related regulation which the government has scrapped in recent years has been followed by three new stipulations .
no one is able to keep track of them anymore without constantly seeking expensive legal advice from consultants .
that ’ s not the way to move forward . " small business owners are also demanding tax reforms to free them from the high tax rates imposed on larger , transnational firms .
they have also requested tax exemptions for profits which are reinvested in the modernization of the production cycle . " over the past few years , some two million new jobs have been created in small and medium-sized companies in germany , " said ohoven .
" over the same period , large companies have axed about the same amount of jobs .
but with more favorable frameworks in place , we could have done much better .
small business owners would liketo employ more staff when the order books are full , but the prospect of not being able to temporarily dismiss workers when the going gets rough has prevented many employers from doing so . ” waiting on opposition platform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is due to unveil the cdu 's election platform next week ohoven said his criticism of the spd ’ s election manifesto did not necessarily mean he would be advising the association 's members to vote for the opposition conservatives should an early election come about in september . he said he is looking forward to hearing what the christian democrats have to offer small business owners .
he wo n't have to wait long - cdu party chief angela merkel is due to present her party ’ s manifesto on monday . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd presents election manifesto germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .
the party 's leader said that the spd would wage its campaign under the motto " trust in germany . "

every labor-related regulation which the government has scrapped in recent years has been followed by three new stipulations .
no one is able to keep track of them anymore without constantly seeking expensive legal advice from consultants .
that ’ s not the way to move forward . " small business owners are also demanding tax reforms to free them from the high tax rates imposed on larger , transnational firms .
they have also requested tax exemptions for profits which are reinvested in the modernization of the production cycle . " over the past few years , some two million new jobs have been created in small and medium-sized companies in germany , " said ohoven .
" over the same period , large companies have axed about the same amount of jobs .
but with more favorable frameworks in place , we could have done much better .
small business owners would liketo employ more staff when the order books are full , but the prospect of not being able to temporarily dismiss workers when the going gets rough has prevented many employers from doing so . ” waiting on opposition platform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is due to unveil the cdu 's election platform next week ohoven said his criticism of the spd ’ s election manifesto did not necessarily mean he would be advising the association 's members to vote for the opposition conservatives should an early election come about in september . he said he is looking forward to hearing what the christian democrats have to offer small business owners .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.07.2005 scottish town prepares for g8 protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters have already marched on edinburgh the people of auchterarder - the small town adjoining the gleneagles golf resort - never asked to host a summit of the world 's most powerful leaders , but they are doing their best to put up with it . dozens of police , many brought up from england for the week , pounded the main street on foot or horseback tuesday , past shop windows covered with plywood with ironic " welcome to auchterarder " signs stapled onto them . overhead , dark chinook military helicopters shared the bright skies with a white airship reportedly fitted with infrared scanners , looking for anyone trying to breach the eight-kilometer -lrb- five-mile -rrb- fence that rings gleneagles . what has everybody in jitters is the risk of violence during an anti-g8 march planned for wednesday that will see up to 5,000 protesters go to within shouting distance of gleneagles ' main gates . edinburgh protests set scene scenes of anarchists hurling bottles and stones at police in edinburgh on monday , with scores arrested or injured , did little to reassure residents .
nor did a morning bomb scare at the local branch of the bank of scotland that saw a stretch of the main road sealed off for two hours .
the premises were searched but nothing was found , a police spokesman said . bildunterschrift : peace protesters gather at the fence surrounding the royal navy submarine base at faslane , scotland , monday july 4 , 2005 .
campaigners say they expect thousands of activists to join the planned blockade of faslane naval base on the river clyde .
demonstrations are due to take place throughout the day at the nuclear base in protest at the amount of money spent by g8 countries on weaponry . " a big damp squib .
that 's what we want , " hoped diane lockhart at the door of the salon 20-20 hairdressing parlor , taking in the passing parade of police and international news media waiting for the summit to begin . tayside police chief constable john vine tried to be reassuring , even as more than 10,000 officers fanned out over scotland for the biggest security operation of its kind ever seen in britain . " we will deal robustly with any people who want to break the law .
let 's make that very clear , " vine , whose jurisdiction takes in gleneagles and auchterarder , told reporters . he noted that the time , route and size of wednesday 's march has been negotiated with its organizers , the leftist g8 alternatives coalition , in contrast to the spontaneous protests in the scottish capital . " we have large numbers of police officers who are well prepared and well equipped should anything arise , " he said . residents behind the cause protests aside , one of the summit 's core issues - battling poverty in africa - has clearly struck a chord in auchterarder , with many shops sporting " make trade history " signs . a global village cafe is up and running for the week - " proceeds to wind-powered pumps for africa " - while the glendevon pub is laying on a " make poverty history " buffet featuring scotland 's national dish , haggis . " we 've all got our opinions , " said the pub 's owner kevin grigsby , who nevertheless is n't boarding up his windows because " it looks too tacky . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland bernadette malone , chief executive of perthshire council , the local authority , said the g8 summit would be " worthwhile " if it can boost the region 's international profile for tourism and conventions . but she pointed out that prime minister tony blair , the summit 's host , never consulted local people before selecting gleneagles more than a year ago as the place to welcome his fellow world leaders . if it is any consolation , auchterarder can take comfort in the fact that , amidst mccallum 's butcher shop , the bear necessities charity shop and the golf inn pub , there is not one mcdonald 's or starbucks outlet on the main road to lure the attention - or stones - of an anti-capitalist troublemaker . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

but experts in germany remain divided over the best way to help the continent out of poverty . hundreds of thousands of people grooved to some of germany 's favorite bands last weekend at the berlin live 8 concert to raise awareness of poverty .
and while most admitted coming out to enjoy the music , there was also some thought of the poor in africa . " yes , it 's true that i came to enjoy the music and the day , " said sebastian hovermann , 22 , of berlin .
" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others . " while he admitted to knowing little about debt relief and other complicated development issues , he , and others in the audience , cheered performers ' calls for increased development aid to africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want to help africa the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives from about 70 euros a year .
learning from the past in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
and in the future , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rapid spread of hiv has created hundreds of thousands of " aids orphans " as a result , the international development community , including the world bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent 's needs .
they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work . " other ngo officials applaud the g8 development initiatives and say an increase in aid to africa could make a real difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says that corruption is key obstacle to african economic development " the millennium development goals are modest ones and yet we are off-track , " said peter eigen , the head of berlin-based transparency international , an ngo devoted to fighting corruption internationally .
" that is why what is going on at gleneages is very important . " eigen cautioned that financial assistance is not enough . " the greatest enemy to economic development is corruption , which aims at buying the wrong decisions and mismanages resources , " he added .
" that does n't mean that corrupt societies do n't deserve our support .
but there has to be a parallel effort in the north and the south for aid to work and both sides need to come through . "
regardless , the outcome of the two-day gleneagles meeting will be closely watched by those in the developing world as a sign of the rich world 's commitments to meet the millennium development goals and its desire to help the world 's poor . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid .

development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .
the olympics in 2012 will be hosted by the first among equals . " real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .
athletes had to make do with using schools , government buildings and military barracks . in addition , food was still rationed so competitors were asked to bring their own supplies and donate any leftovers to hospitals .
wembley stadium , which survived the bombings , was fitted with a temporary running track and used as the main venue . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .

british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2005 industry criticizes spd election manifesto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business owners were hoping for better news from the chancellor german industry representatives have sharply criticized the election manifesto presented by the social democrats on tuesday , calling it incoherent and unlikely to bring about a much-needed economic upswing . the president of the german association of small and medium-sized businesses -lrb- bvmw -rrb- criticized the spd ’ s plans , saying they would not ensure a sustainable economic recovery .
mario ohoven said he could not relate to the social democrats ’ election manifesto and felt the spd leadership ’ s recent attempts to woo back leftist supporters had resulted in too many amendments to its social and economic reform course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz müntefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections " the spd election manifesto contains too many populist promises , " ohoven said .
" we 've always supported the chancellor ’ s reform agenda , but now we see this agenda being watered down further .
such incoherence won ’ t help us or the spd in the long run . " less bureaucracy ohoven said he wanted the consolidation of the federal budget to remain a top priority .
he added that the government would do well to prune away at the jungle of bureaucratic rules that was making life almost impossible for small and medium-sized firms , which he said are the backbone of the national economy . " each person in a small company spends about 60 hours a year to fill in statistical data sheets in line with state-level or community-level regulations , " ohoven said .
" this is only one example of germany 's rampant bureaucracy .
every labor-related regulation which the government has scrapped in recent years has been followed by three new stipulations .
no one is able to keep track of them anymore without constantly seeking expensive legal advice from consultants .
that ’ s not the way to move forward . " small business owners are also demanding tax reforms to free them from the high tax rates imposed on larger , transnational firms .
they have also requested tax exemptions for profits which are reinvested in the modernization of the production cycle . " over the past few years , some two million new jobs have been created in small and medium-sized companies in germany , " said ohoven .
" over the same period , large companies have axed about the same amount of jobs .
but with more favorable frameworks in place , we could have done much better .
small business owners would liketo employ more staff when the order books are full , but the prospect of not being able to temporarily dismiss workers when the going gets rough has prevented many employers from doing so . ” waiting on opposition platform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is due to unveil the cdu 's election platform next week ohoven said his criticism of the spd ’ s election manifesto did not necessarily mean he would be advising the association 's members to vote for the opposition conservatives should an early election come about in september . he said he is looking forward to hearing what the christian democrats have to offer small business owners .
he wo n't have to wait long - cdu party chief angela merkel is due to present her party ’ s manifesto on monday . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd presents election manifesto germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .

mario ohoven said he could not relate to the social democrats ’ election manifesto and felt the spd leadership ’ s recent attempts to woo back leftist supporters had resulted in too many amendments to its social and economic reform course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz müntefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections " the spd election manifesto contains too many populist promises , " ohoven said .
" we 've always supported the chancellor ’ s reform agenda , but now we see this agenda being watered down further .
such incoherence won ’ t help us or the spd in the long run . " less bureaucracy ohoven said he wanted the consolidation of the federal budget to remain a top priority .
he added that the government would do well to prune away at the jungle of bureaucratic rules that was making life almost impossible for small and medium-sized firms , which he said are the backbone of the national economy . " each person in a small company spends about 60 hours a year to fill in statistical data sheets in line with state-level or community-level regulations , " ohoven said .
" this is only one example of germany 's rampant bureaucracy .
every labor-related regulation which the government has scrapped in recent years has been followed by three new stipulations .
no one is able to keep track of them anymore without constantly seeking expensive legal advice from consultants .
that ’ s not the way to move forward . " small business owners are also demanding tax reforms to free them from the high tax rates imposed on larger , transnational firms .
they have also requested tax exemptions for profits which are reinvested in the modernization of the production cycle . " over the past few years , some two million new jobs have been created in small and medium-sized companies in germany , " said ohoven .
" over the same period , large companies have axed about the same amount of jobs .
but with more favorable frameworks in place , we could have done much better .
small business owners would liketo employ more staff when the order books are full , but the prospect of not being able to temporarily dismiss workers when the going gets rough has prevented many employers from doing so . ” waiting on opposition platform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is due to unveil the cdu 's election platform next week ohoven said his criticism of the spd ’ s election manifesto did not necessarily mean he would be advising the association 's members to vote for the opposition conservatives should an early election come about in september . he said he is looking forward to hearing what the christian democrats have to offer small business owners .

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .
the olympics in 2012 will be hosted by the first among equals . " real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .
athletes had to make do with using schools , government buildings and military barracks . in addition , food was still rationed so competitors were asked to bring their own supplies and donate any leftovers to hospitals .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

the demonstrators were later chased off . the majority of the 3,000 people on the march stuck to the agreed route through the village of auchterarder , rallying at a point some 500 meters -lrb- 546 yards -rrb- away from the summit site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters are dragged by police from the a9 motorway near gleneagles , scotland , wednesday , july , 6 , 2005 .
they were blocked by a wire fence and lines of riot police - some of them on horseback - guarding the posh gleneagles resort , the venue of the three-day summit that began wednesday . demonstrators hoisted two large banners , one of them reading " fight poverty , not war , bring the troops home , " and shouted " they say drop bombs , we say drop the debt . " many of the protesters then headed back to the small town of auchterardar , where they had earlier assembled , accompanied by a bagpiper in full highland regalia playing " scotland the brave . " the trouble at the fence broke out on the return trip . " the most violent men on earth today are at gleneagles and they are called the g8 , " controversial british mp george galloway told the crowd ahead of the march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2005 industry criticizes spd election manifesto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business owners were hoping for better news from the chancellor german industry representatives have sharply criticized the election manifesto presented by the social democrats on tuesday , calling it incoherent and unlikely to bring about a much-needed economic upswing . the president of the german association of small and medium-sized businesses -lrb- bvmw -rrb- criticized the spd ’ s plans , saying they would not ensure a sustainable economic recovery .
mario ohoven said he could not relate to the social democrats ’ election manifesto and felt the spd leadership ’ s recent attempts to woo back leftist supporters had resulted in too many amendments to its social and economic reform course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz müntefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections " the spd election manifesto contains too many populist promises , " ohoven said .
" we 've always supported the chancellor ’ s reform agenda , but now we see this agenda being watered down further .
such incoherence won ’ t help us or the spd in the long run . " less bureaucracy ohoven said he wanted the consolidation of the federal budget to remain a top priority .
he added that the government would do well to prune away at the jungle of bureaucratic rules that was making life almost impossible for small and medium-sized firms , which he said are the backbone of the national economy . " each person in a small company spends about 60 hours a year to fill in statistical data sheets in line with state-level or community-level regulations , " ohoven said .
" this is only one example of germany 's rampant bureaucracy .
every labor-related regulation which the government has scrapped in recent years has been followed by three new stipulations .
no one is able to keep track of them anymore without constantly seeking expensive legal advice from consultants .
that ’ s not the way to move forward . " small business owners are also demanding tax reforms to free them from the high tax rates imposed on larger , transnational firms .
they have also requested tax exemptions for profits which are reinvested in the modernization of the production cycle . " over the past few years , some two million new jobs have been created in small and medium-sized companies in germany , " said ohoven .
" over the same period , large companies have axed about the same amount of jobs .
but with more favorable frameworks in place , we could have done much better .
small business owners would liketo employ more staff when the order books are full , but the prospect of not being able to temporarily dismiss workers when the going gets rough has prevented many employers from doing so . ” waiting on opposition platform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is due to unveil the cdu 's election platform next week ohoven said his criticism of the spd ’ s election manifesto did not necessarily mean he would be advising the association 's members to vote for the opposition conservatives should an early election come about in september . he said he is looking forward to hearing what the christian democrats have to offer small business owners .
he wo n't have to wait long - cdu party chief angela merkel is due to present her party ’ s manifesto on monday . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd presents election manifesto germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .

mario ohoven said he could not relate to the social democrats ’ election manifesto and felt the spd leadership ’ s recent attempts to woo back leftist supporters had resulted in too many amendments to its social and economic reform course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz müntefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections " the spd election manifesto contains too many populist promises , " ohoven said .
" we 've always supported the chancellor ’ s reform agenda , but now we see this agenda being watered down further .
such incoherence won ’ t help us or the spd in the long run . " less bureaucracy ohoven said he wanted the consolidation of the federal budget to remain a top priority .
he added that the government would do well to prune away at the jungle of bureaucratic rules that was making life almost impossible for small and medium-sized firms , which he said are the backbone of the national economy . " each person in a small company spends about 60 hours a year to fill in statistical data sheets in line with state-level or community-level regulations , " ohoven said .
" this is only one example of germany 's rampant bureaucracy .

boarding passes are to be personalized with the passenger 's thumbprint " if possible as early as next year , " company spokesman thomas jachnow said .
laboratory testing of the system , involving lufthansa 's own employees , had begun on monday and was scheduled to last two weeks .
the results of the test would then be analyzed and , if deemed successful , widespread use of the system could be introduced " in the course of 2006 , " jachnow said .
the launch date would therefore come before biometric finger-printing is officially introduced in german passports and identity cards .
under the system , passengers submit a thumbprint at the check-in counter which is then checked at the boarding gate .
the aim of the system is to prevent people who are not on the passenger list from boarding a plane .
frequent flyers could even be given smart cards that contain their digital finger print and other personal data .
asked about possible abuse of the data , jachnow insisted that all personal information would be encoded , rendering it useless for outside parties .
passengers could also request that the data contained on the boarding pass be immediately deleted once the check had been carried out , he said . dw-world.de germans to get biometric passports germany is to introduce passports containing biometric information stored on an electronic chip from nov .

laboratory testing of the system , involving lufthansa 's own employees , had begun on monday and was scheduled to last two weeks .
the results of the test would then be analyzed and , if deemed successful , widespread use of the system could be introduced " in the course of 2006 , " jachnow said .
the launch date would therefore come before biometric finger-printing is officially introduced in german passports and identity cards .
under the system , passengers submit a thumbprint at the check-in counter which is then checked at the boarding gate .
the aim of the system is to prevent people who are not on the passenger list from boarding a plane .
frequent flyers could even be given smart cards that contain their digital finger print and other personal data .
asked about possible abuse of the data , jachnow insisted that all personal information would be encoded , rendering it useless for outside parties .
passengers could also request that the data contained on the boarding pass be immediately deleted once the check had been carried out , he said . dw-world.de germans to get biometric passports germany is to introduce passports containing biometric information stored on an electronic chip from nov .

the number of new car registrations - a key gauge of domestic demand in the sector - rose by 8 percent to 335,000 in june , vda calculated .
and in the first six months of 2005 , new car registrations rose by 2 percent to 1.695 million .
in view of the favorable numbers , vda was upgrading its forecast for the whole year to 3.3 million new car registrations , the federation told a news conference here .
" the favorable performance of new models , rising domestic orders and the replacement of existing cars makes us confident for the full year , " vda president bernd gottschalk said .
significantly , growth in domestic demand for new cars is now outpacing growth in overseas demand for german-made cars , vda noted .
export orders for new cars , hitherto the driving force of sales in the second , grew by just 4 percent to 362,800 vehicles in june and stagnated at 1.92 million in the first six months , as carmakers paid the price of the strong euro , high raw material and oil prices and fierce competition from low-pay countries .

the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .

development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .

but experts in germany remain divided over the best way to help the continent out of poverty . hundreds of thousands of people grooved to some of germany 's favorite bands last weekend at the berlin live 8 concert to raise awareness of poverty .
and while most admitted coming out to enjoy the music , there was also some thought of the poor in africa . " yes , it 's true that i came to enjoy the music and the day , " said sebastian hovermann , 22 , of berlin .
" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others . " while he admitted to knowing little about debt relief and other complicated development issues , he , and others in the audience , cheered performers ' calls for increased development aid to africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want to help africa the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives from about 70 euros a year .
learning from the past in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
and in the future , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rapid spread of hiv has created hundreds of thousands of " aids orphans " as a result , the international development community , including the world bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent 's needs .
they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work . " other ngo officials applaud the g8 development initiatives and say an increase in aid to africa could make a real difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says that corruption is key obstacle to african economic development " the millennium development goals are modest ones and yet we are off-track , " said peter eigen , the head of berlin-based transparency international , an ngo devoted to fighting corruption internationally .
" that is why what is going on at gleneages is very important . " eigen cautioned that financial assistance is not enough . " the greatest enemy to economic development is corruption , which aims at buying the wrong decisions and mismanages resources , " he added .
" that does n't mean that corrupt societies do n't deserve our support .
but there has to be a parallel effort in the north and the south for aid to work and both sides need to come through . "
regardless , the outcome of the two-day gleneagles meeting will be closely watched by those in the developing world as a sign of the rich world 's commitments to meet the millennium development goals and its desire to help the world 's poor . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .

the number of new car registrations - a key gauge of domestic demand in the sector - rose by 8 percent to 335,000 in june , vda calculated .
and in the first six months of 2005 , new car registrations rose by 2 percent to 1.695 million .
in view of the favorable numbers , vda was upgrading its forecast for the whole year to 3.3 million new car registrations , the federation told a news conference here .
" the favorable performance of new models , rising domestic orders and the replacement of existing cars makes us confident for the full year , " vda president bernd gottschalk said .
significantly , growth in domestic demand for new cars is now outpacing growth in overseas demand for german-made cars , vda noted .
export orders for new cars , hitherto the driving force of sales in the second , grew by just 4 percent to 362,800 vehicles in june and stagnated at 1.92 million in the first six months , as carmakers paid the price of the strong euro , high raw material and oil prices and fierce competition from low-pay countries .
a total of 516,200 cars rolled off german production lines in june , 6 percent more than in the year-earlier month . dw-world.de german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .
but as affordable foreign cars offer consumers an attractive alternative , how long will this still be the case ?

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .

" real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .

british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .

we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .

i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .

i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .
athletes had to make do with using schools , government buildings and military barracks . in addition , food was still rationed so competitors were asked to bring their own supplies and donate any leftovers to hospitals .

" real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .
athletes had to make do with using schools , government buildings and military barracks . in addition , food was still rationed so competitors were asked to bring their own supplies and donate any leftovers to hospitals .
wembley stadium , which survived the bombings , was fitted with a temporary running track and used as the main venue . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.07.2005 leaders in a stew over culinary heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac does n't think much of fish and chips french president jacques chirac flies into scotland on wednesday for the g8 summit after allegedly slamming british cuisine .
battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .

" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .

" he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .

mario ohoven said he could not relate to the social democrats ’ election manifesto and felt the spd leadership ’ s recent attempts to woo back leftist supporters had resulted in too many amendments to its social and economic reform course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz müntefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections " the spd election manifesto contains too many populist promises , " ohoven said .
" we 've always supported the chancellor ’ s reform agenda , but now we see this agenda being watered down further .
such incoherence won ’ t help us or the spd in the long run . " less bureaucracy ohoven said he wanted the consolidation of the federal budget to remain a top priority .
he added that the government would do well to prune away at the jungle of bureaucratic rules that was making life almost impossible for small and medium-sized firms , which he said are the backbone of the national economy . " each person in a small company spends about 60 hours a year to fill in statistical data sheets in line with state-level or community-level regulations , " ohoven said .
" this is only one example of germany 's rampant bureaucracy .
every labor-related regulation which the government has scrapped in recent years has been followed by three new stipulations .
no one is able to keep track of them anymore without constantly seeking expensive legal advice from consultants .
that ’ s not the way to move forward . " small business owners are also demanding tax reforms to free them from the high tax rates imposed on larger , transnational firms .
they have also requested tax exemptions for profits which are reinvested in the modernization of the production cycle . " over the past few years , some two million new jobs have been created in small and medium-sized companies in germany , " said ohoven .
" over the same period , large companies have axed about the same amount of jobs .
but with more favorable frameworks in place , we could have done much better .
small business owners would liketo employ more staff when the order books are full , but the prospect of not being able to temporarily dismiss workers when the going gets rough has prevented many employers from doing so . ” waiting on opposition platform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is due to unveil the cdu 's election platform next week ohoven said his criticism of the spd ’ s election manifesto did not necessarily mean he would be advising the association 's members to vote for the opposition conservatives should an early election come about in september . he said he is looking forward to hearing what the christian democrats have to offer small business owners .

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .
the olympics in 2012 will be hosted by the first among equals . " real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .

complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .

mario ohoven said he could not relate to the social democrats ’ election manifesto and felt the spd leadership ’ s recent attempts to woo back leftist supporters had resulted in too many amendments to its social and economic reform course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz müntefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections " the spd election manifesto contains too many populist promises , " ohoven said .
" we 've always supported the chancellor ’ s reform agenda , but now we see this agenda being watered down further .
such incoherence won ’ t help us or the spd in the long run . " less bureaucracy ohoven said he wanted the consolidation of the federal budget to remain a top priority .
he added that the government would do well to prune away at the jungle of bureaucratic rules that was making life almost impossible for small and medium-sized firms , which he said are the backbone of the national economy . " each person in a small company spends about 60 hours a year to fill in statistical data sheets in line with state-level or community-level regulations , " ohoven said .
" this is only one example of germany 's rampant bureaucracy .
every labor-related regulation which the government has scrapped in recent years has been followed by three new stipulations .
no one is able to keep track of them anymore without constantly seeking expensive legal advice from consultants .
that ’ s not the way to move forward . " small business owners are also demanding tax reforms to free them from the high tax rates imposed on larger , transnational firms .
they have also requested tax exemptions for profits which are reinvested in the modernization of the production cycle . " over the past few years , some two million new jobs have been created in small and medium-sized companies in germany , " said ohoven .
" over the same period , large companies have axed about the same amount of jobs .
but with more favorable frameworks in place , we could have done much better .
small business owners would liketo employ more staff when the order books are full , but the prospect of not being able to temporarily dismiss workers when the going gets rough has prevented many employers from doing so . ” waiting on opposition platform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is due to unveil the cdu 's election platform next week ohoven said his criticism of the spd ’ s election manifesto did not necessarily mean he would be advising the association 's members to vote for the opposition conservatives should an early election come about in september . he said he is looking forward to hearing what the christian democrats have to offer small business owners .
he wo n't have to wait long - cdu party chief angela merkel is due to present her party ’ s manifesto on monday . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd presents election manifesto germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2005 london named 2012 olympic host city großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : londoners celebrate the announcement from the ioc london was announced as the host city for the 2012 olympic summer games , beating paris in one of the hardest fought and closest bidding campaigns in the history of the games . london has beaten paris to the finishing line in the race to become the host city of the 2012 olympic games .
the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .
the olympics in 2012 will be hosted by the first among equals . " real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.07.2005 leaders in a stew over culinary heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac does n't think much of fish and chips french president jacques chirac flies into scotland on wednesday for the g8 summit after allegedly slamming british cuisine .
battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .

nor did a morning bomb scare at the local branch of the bank of scotland that saw a stretch of the main road sealed off for two hours .
the premises were searched but nothing was found , a police spokesman said . bildunterschrift : peace protesters gather at the fence surrounding the royal navy submarine base at faslane , scotland , monday july 4 , 2005 .
campaigners say they expect thousands of activists to join the planned blockade of faslane naval base on the river clyde .
demonstrations are due to take place throughout the day at the nuclear base in protest at the amount of money spent by g8 countries on weaponry . " a big damp squib .
that 's what we want , " hoped diane lockhart at the door of the salon 20-20 hairdressing parlor , taking in the passing parade of police and international news media waiting for the summit to begin . tayside police chief constable john vine tried to be reassuring , even as more than 10,000 officers fanned out over scotland for the biggest security operation of its kind ever seen in britain . " we will deal robustly with any people who want to break the law .
let 's make that very clear , " vine , whose jurisdiction takes in gleneagles and auchterarder , told reporters . he noted that the time , route and size of wednesday 's march has been negotiated with its organizers , the leftist g8 alternatives coalition , in contrast to the spontaneous protests in the scottish capital . " we have large numbers of police officers who are well prepared and well equipped should anything arise , " he said . residents behind the cause protests aside , one of the summit 's core issues - battling poverty in africa - has clearly struck a chord in auchterarder , with many shops sporting " make trade history " signs . a global village cafe is up and running for the week - " proceeds to wind-powered pumps for africa " - while the glendevon pub is laying on a " make poverty history " buffet featuring scotland 's national dish , haggis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.07.2005 africa needs help , but how ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the us say more aid wo n't reach the right people the g8 summit kicks off wednesday in the wake of rock concerts and calls for increased aid and debt relief for africa .
but experts in germany remain divided over the best way to help the continent out of poverty . hundreds of thousands of people grooved to some of germany 's favorite bands last weekend at the berlin live 8 concert to raise awareness of poverty .
and while most admitted coming out to enjoy the music , there was also some thought of the poor in africa . " yes , it 's true that i came to enjoy the music and the day , " said sebastian hovermann , 22 , of berlin .
" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others . " while he admitted to knowing little about debt relief and other complicated development issues , he , and others in the audience , cheered performers ' calls for increased development aid to africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want to help africa the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives from about 70 euros a year .
learning from the past in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
and in the future , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rapid spread of hiv has created hundreds of thousands of " aids orphans " as a result , the international development community , including the world bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent 's needs .
they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work . " other ngo officials applaud the g8 development initiatives and say an increase in aid to africa could make a real difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says that corruption is key obstacle to african economic development " the millennium development goals are modest ones and yet we are off-track , " said peter eigen , the head of berlin-based transparency international , an ngo devoted to fighting corruption internationally .
" that is why what is going on at gleneages is very important . " eigen cautioned that financial assistance is not enough . " the greatest enemy to economic development is corruption , which aims at buying the wrong decisions and mismanages resources , " he added .
" that does n't mean that corrupt societies do n't deserve our support .
but there has to be a parallel effort in the north and the south for aid to work and both sides need to come through . "
regardless , the outcome of the two-day gleneagles meeting will be closely watched by those in the developing world as a sign of the rich world 's commitments to meet the millennium development goals and its desire to help the world 's poor . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

but experts in germany remain divided over the best way to help the continent out of poverty . hundreds of thousands of people grooved to some of germany 's favorite bands last weekend at the berlin live 8 concert to raise awareness of poverty .
and while most admitted coming out to enjoy the music , there was also some thought of the poor in africa . " yes , it 's true that i came to enjoy the music and the day , " said sebastian hovermann , 22 , of berlin .
" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others . " while he admitted to knowing little about debt relief and other complicated development issues , he , and others in the audience , cheered performers ' calls for increased development aid to africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want to help africa the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives from about 70 euros a year .
learning from the past in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
and in the future , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rapid spread of hiv has created hundreds of thousands of " aids orphans " as a result , the international development community , including the world bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent 's needs .
they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .

they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .

some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.07.2005 leaders in a stew over culinary heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac does n't think much of fish and chips french president jacques chirac flies into scotland on wednesday for the g8 summit after allegedly slamming british cuisine .
battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

but experts in germany remain divided over the best way to help the continent out of poverty . hundreds of thousands of people grooved to some of germany 's favorite bands last weekend at the berlin live 8 concert to raise awareness of poverty .
and while most admitted coming out to enjoy the music , there was also some thought of the poor in africa . " yes , it 's true that i came to enjoy the music and the day , " said sebastian hovermann , 22 , of berlin .
" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others . " while he admitted to knowing little about debt relief and other complicated development issues , he , and others in the audience , cheered performers ' calls for increased development aid to africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want to help africa the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives from about 70 euros a year .
learning from the past in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
and in the future , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rapid spread of hiv has created hundreds of thousands of " aids orphans " as a result , the international development community , including the world bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent 's needs .
they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work . " other ngo officials applaud the g8 development initiatives and say an increase in aid to africa could make a real difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says that corruption is key obstacle to african economic development " the millennium development goals are modest ones and yet we are off-track , " said peter eigen , the head of berlin-based transparency international , an ngo devoted to fighting corruption internationally .
" that is why what is going on at gleneages is very important . " eigen cautioned that financial assistance is not enough . " the greatest enemy to economic development is corruption , which aims at buying the wrong decisions and mismanages resources , " he added .
" that does n't mean that corrupt societies do n't deserve our support .
but there has to be a parallel effort in the north and the south for aid to work and both sides need to come through . "
regardless , the outcome of the two-day gleneagles meeting will be closely watched by those in the developing world as a sign of the rich world 's commitments to meet the millennium development goals and its desire to help the world 's poor . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.07.2005 leaders in a stew over culinary heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac does n't think much of fish and chips french president jacques chirac flies into scotland on wednesday for the g8 summit after allegedly slamming british cuisine .
battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .

if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .

but experts in germany remain divided over the best way to help the continent out of poverty . hundreds of thousands of people grooved to some of germany 's favorite bands last weekend at the berlin live 8 concert to raise awareness of poverty .
and while most admitted coming out to enjoy the music , there was also some thought of the poor in africa . " yes , it 's true that i came to enjoy the music and the day , " said sebastian hovermann , 22 , of berlin .
" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others . " while he admitted to knowing little about debt relief and other complicated development issues , he , and others in the audience , cheered performers ' calls for increased development aid to africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want to help africa the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rapid spread of hiv has created hundreds of thousands of " aids orphans " as a result , the international development community , including the world bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent 's needs .
they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work . " other ngo officials applaud the g8 development initiatives and say an increase in aid to africa could make a real difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says that corruption is key obstacle to african economic development " the millennium development goals are modest ones and yet we are off-track , " said peter eigen , the head of berlin-based transparency international , an ngo devoted to fighting corruption internationally .

" that does n't mean that corrupt societies do n't deserve our support .
but there has to be a parallel effort in the north and the south for aid to work and both sides need to come through . "

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .

british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .

nor did a morning bomb scare at the local branch of the bank of scotland that saw a stretch of the main road sealed off for two hours .
the premises were searched but nothing was found , a police spokesman said . bildunterschrift : peace protesters gather at the fence surrounding the royal navy submarine base at faslane , scotland , monday july 4 , 2005 .
campaigners say they expect thousands of activists to join the planned blockade of faslane naval base on the river clyde .
demonstrations are due to take place throughout the day at the nuclear base in protest at the amount of money spent by g8 countries on weaponry . " a big damp squib .
that 's what we want , " hoped diane lockhart at the door of the salon 20-20 hairdressing parlor , taking in the passing parade of police and international news media waiting for the summit to begin . tayside police chief constable john vine tried to be reassuring , even as more than 10,000 officers fanned out over scotland for the biggest security operation of its kind ever seen in britain . " we will deal robustly with any people who want to break the law .
let 's make that very clear , " vine , whose jurisdiction takes in gleneagles and auchterarder , told reporters . he noted that the time , route and size of wednesday 's march has been negotiated with its organizers , the leftist g8 alternatives coalition , in contrast to the spontaneous protests in the scottish capital . " we have large numbers of police officers who are well prepared and well equipped should anything arise , " he said . residents behind the cause protests aside , one of the summit 's core issues - battling poverty in africa - has clearly struck a chord in auchterarder , with many shops sporting " make trade history " signs . a global village cafe is up and running for the week - " proceeds to wind-powered pumps for africa " - while the glendevon pub is laying on a " make poverty history " buffet featuring scotland 's national dish , haggis . " we 've all got our opinions , " said the pub 's owner kevin grigsby , who nevertheless is n't boarding up his windows because " it looks too tacky . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland bernadette malone , chief executive of perthshire council , the local authority , said the g8 summit would be " worthwhile " if it can boost the region 's international profile for tourism and conventions . but she pointed out that prime minister tony blair , the summit 's host , never consulted local people before selecting gleneagles more than a year ago as the place to welcome his fellow world leaders . if it is any consolation , auchterarder can take comfort in the fact that , amidst mccallum 's butcher shop , the bear necessities charity shop and the golf inn pub , there is not one mcdonald 's or starbucks outlet on the main road to lure the attention - or stones - of an anti-capitalist troublemaker . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .

" french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .

" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .

posts affected were as far flung as the european commission in brussels , taiwan 's postal service and australian rail traffic controllers . us airline delta was forced to cancel several flights and finland 's third-largest bank shut its 130 branch offices in a preventive move to keep the worm from infecting its computers . a more lenient sentence ? jaschan was known locally as a friendly high school student until police knocked at his parents ' door in the northern village of waffensen in may 2004 . he was fingered by an anonymous acquaintance , leading authorities to raid his home .
they found substantial incriminating evidence - including the sasser code on a computer he built himself - and jaschan admitted during questioning to designing the worm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the courtroom in verden , lower saxony , where the trial is taking place he is now facing charges including sabotage , data manipulation and disruption of public administration .
the charges would normally carry a prison sentence of up to five years . but because he was a minor at the time he launched the worm , jaschan can expect a more lenient sentence , kruetzfeldt said . " if he admits his crime it will be a short trial , " she said .
" the court must hand down a sentence that can have an educational effect on the young man . " a verdict could come as early as thursday .
jaschan may also face a series of civil lawsuits . virulent and expensive a computer worm , unlike a virus , does not have to travel through e-mail but can spread by itself to any unprotected computer linked to the internet . sasser attacked through a flaw in certain versions of microsoft 's windows operating systems - windows 2000 , windows server 2003 and windows xp - and forced the computer into an unstoppable pattern of shutting down , then rebooting .
it apparently did no lasting harm . the software giant had offered a 250,000-dollar -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- reward for information leading to the arrest of the culprit.german prosecutors have only been able to document some 130,000 euros in damage from sasser but computer experts say the true figure is in the millions . many companies have been reluctant to cooperate with the authorities due to image concerns . jaschan , whose parents own a computer service company , now works for a german security software firm called securepoint which specializes in defenses against viruses and worms . a company representative said jaschan would remain an employee regardless of the outcome of the trial . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teen faces court over computer worm a german teenager responsible for the sasser computer worm pandemic went on trial tuesday .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

nor did a morning bomb scare at the local branch of the bank of scotland that saw a stretch of the main road sealed off for two hours .
the premises were searched but nothing was found , a police spokesman said . bildunterschrift : peace protesters gather at the fence surrounding the royal navy submarine base at faslane , scotland , monday july 4 , 2005 .
campaigners say they expect thousands of activists to join the planned blockade of faslane naval base on the river clyde .
demonstrations are due to take place throughout the day at the nuclear base in protest at the amount of money spent by g8 countries on weaponry . " a big damp squib .
that 's what we want , " hoped diane lockhart at the door of the salon 20-20 hairdressing parlor , taking in the passing parade of police and international news media waiting for the summit to begin . tayside police chief constable john vine tried to be reassuring , even as more than 10,000 officers fanned out over scotland for the biggest security operation of its kind ever seen in britain . " we will deal robustly with any people who want to break the law .
let 's make that very clear , " vine , whose jurisdiction takes in gleneagles and auchterarder , told reporters . he noted that the time , route and size of wednesday 's march has been negotiated with its organizers , the leftist g8 alternatives coalition , in contrast to the spontaneous protests in the scottish capital . " we have large numbers of police officers who are well prepared and well equipped should anything arise , " he said . residents behind the cause protests aside , one of the summit 's core issues - battling poverty in africa - has clearly struck a chord in auchterarder , with many shops sporting " make trade history " signs . a global village cafe is up and running for the week - " proceeds to wind-powered pumps for africa " - while the glendevon pub is laying on a " make poverty history " buffet featuring scotland 's national dish , haggis . " we 've all got our opinions , " said the pub 's owner kevin grigsby , who nevertheless is n't boarding up his windows because " it looks too tacky . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland bernadette malone , chief executive of perthshire council , the local authority , said the g8 summit would be " worthwhile " if it can boost the region 's international profile for tourism and conventions . but she pointed out that prime minister tony blair , the summit 's host , never consulted local people before selecting gleneagles more than a year ago as the place to welcome his fellow world leaders . if it is any consolation , auchterarder can take comfort in the fact that , amidst mccallum 's butcher shop , the bear necessities charity shop and the golf inn pub , there is not one mcdonald 's or starbucks outlet on the main road to lure the attention - or stones - of an anti-capitalist troublemaker . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .

despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .

posts affected were as far flung as the european commission in brussels , taiwan 's postal service and australian rail traffic controllers . us airline delta was forced to cancel several flights and finland 's third-largest bank shut its 130 branch offices in a preventive move to keep the worm from infecting its computers . a more lenient sentence ? jaschan was known locally as a friendly high school student until police knocked at his parents ' door in the northern village of waffensen in may 2004 . he was fingered by an anonymous acquaintance , leading authorities to raid his home .
they found substantial incriminating evidence - including the sasser code on a computer he built himself - and jaschan admitted during questioning to designing the worm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the courtroom in verden , lower saxony , where the trial is taking place he is now facing charges including sabotage , data manipulation and disruption of public administration .
the charges would normally carry a prison sentence of up to five years . but because he was a minor at the time he launched the worm , jaschan can expect a more lenient sentence , kruetzfeldt said . " if he admits his crime it will be a short trial , " she said .
" the court must hand down a sentence that can have an educational effect on the young man . " a verdict could come as early as thursday .
jaschan may also face a series of civil lawsuits . virulent and expensive a computer worm , unlike a virus , does not have to travel through e-mail but can spread by itself to any unprotected computer linked to the internet . sasser attacked through a flaw in certain versions of microsoft 's windows operating systems - windows 2000 , windows server 2003 and windows xp - and forced the computer into an unstoppable pattern of shutting down , then rebooting .
it apparently did no lasting harm . the software giant had offered a 250,000-dollar -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- reward for information leading to the arrest of the culprit.german prosecutors have only been able to document some 130,000 euros in damage from sasser but computer experts say the true figure is in the millions . many companies have been reluctant to cooperate with the authorities due to image concerns . jaschan , whose parents own a computer service company , now works for a german security software firm called securepoint which specializes in defenses against viruses and worms . a company representative said jaschan would remain an employee regardless of the outcome of the trial . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teen faces court over computer worm a german teenager responsible for the sasser computer worm pandemic went on trial tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.07.2005 leaders in a stew over culinary heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac does n't think much of fish and chips french president jacques chirac flies into scotland on wednesday for the g8 summit after allegedly slamming british cuisine .
battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .
the olympics in 2012 will be hosted by the first among equals . " real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .
athletes had to make do with using schools , government buildings and military barracks . in addition , food was still rationed so competitors were asked to bring their own supplies and donate any leftovers to hospitals .
wembley stadium , which survived the bombings , was fitted with a temporary running track and used as the main venue . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .

development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .
the olympics in 2012 will be hosted by the first among equals . " real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .
athletes had to make do with using schools , government buildings and military barracks . in addition , food was still rationed so competitors were asked to bring their own supplies and donate any leftovers to hospitals .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .
" we hope that , as the president of an esteemed wine-producing country , you could provide the wines , " he wrote . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .

but experts in germany remain divided over the best way to help the continent out of poverty . hundreds of thousands of people grooved to some of germany 's favorite bands last weekend at the berlin live 8 concert to raise awareness of poverty .
and while most admitted coming out to enjoy the music , there was also some thought of the poor in africa . " yes , it 's true that i came to enjoy the music and the day , " said sebastian hovermann , 22 , of berlin .
" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others . " while he admitted to knowing little about debt relief and other complicated development issues , he , and others in the audience , cheered performers ' calls for increased development aid to africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want to help africa the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives from about 70 euros a year .
learning from the past in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
and in the future , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rapid spread of hiv has created hundreds of thousands of " aids orphans " as a result , the international development community , including the world bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent 's needs .
they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work . " other ngo officials applaud the g8 development initiatives and say an increase in aid to africa could make a real difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says that corruption is key obstacle to african economic development " the millennium development goals are modest ones and yet we are off-track , " said peter eigen , the head of berlin-based transparency international , an ngo devoted to fighting corruption internationally .
" that is why what is going on at gleneages is very important . " eigen cautioned that financial assistance is not enough . " the greatest enemy to economic development is corruption , which aims at buying the wrong decisions and mismanages resources , " he added .
" that does n't mean that corrupt societies do n't deserve our support .
but there has to be a parallel effort in the north and the south for aid to work and both sides need to come through . "
regardless , the outcome of the two-day gleneagles meeting will be closely watched by those in the developing world as a sign of the rich world 's commitments to meet the millennium development goals and its desire to help the world 's poor . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others .

some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .

nor did a morning bomb scare at the local branch of the bank of scotland that saw a stretch of the main road sealed off for two hours .
the premises were searched but nothing was found , a police spokesman said . bildunterschrift : peace protesters gather at the fence surrounding the royal navy submarine base at faslane , scotland , monday july 4 , 2005 .
campaigners say they expect thousands of activists to join the planned blockade of faslane naval base on the river clyde .
demonstrations are due to take place throughout the day at the nuclear base in protest at the amount of money spent by g8 countries on weaponry . " a big damp squib .
that 's what we want , " hoped diane lockhart at the door of the salon 20-20 hairdressing parlor , taking in the passing parade of police and international news media waiting for the summit to begin . tayside police chief constable john vine tried to be reassuring , even as more than 10,000 officers fanned out over scotland for the biggest security operation of its kind ever seen in britain . " we will deal robustly with any people who want to break the law .
let 's make that very clear , " vine , whose jurisdiction takes in gleneagles and auchterarder , told reporters . he noted that the time , route and size of wednesday 's march has been negotiated with its organizers , the leftist g8 alternatives coalition , in contrast to the spontaneous protests in the scottish capital . " we have large numbers of police officers who are well prepared and well equipped should anything arise , " he said . residents behind the cause protests aside , one of the summit 's core issues - battling poverty in africa - has clearly struck a chord in auchterarder , with many shops sporting " make trade history " signs . a global village cafe is up and running for the week - " proceeds to wind-powered pumps for africa " - while the glendevon pub is laying on a " make poverty history " buffet featuring scotland 's national dish , haggis . " we 've all got our opinions , " said the pub 's owner kevin grigsby , who nevertheless is n't boarding up his windows because " it looks too tacky . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland bernadette malone , chief executive of perthshire council , the local authority , said the g8 summit would be " worthwhile " if it can boost the region 's international profile for tourism and conventions . but she pointed out that prime minister tony blair , the summit 's host , never consulted local people before selecting gleneagles more than a year ago as the place to welcome his fellow world leaders . if it is any consolation , auchterarder can take comfort in the fact that , amidst mccallum 's butcher shop , the bear necessities charity shop and the golf inn pub , there is not one mcdonald 's or starbucks outlet on the main road to lure the attention - or stones - of an anti-capitalist troublemaker . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .
and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world .
-lrb- july 5 , 2005 -rrb- germany rejects doubling aid to africa germany has questioned a british proposal that the g8 nations double their development aid .
chancellor schröder 's africa advisor said that a sudden increase in foreign aid to african countries would be counterproductive .
-lrb- june 28 , 2005 -rrb- a platform for protest in the last years hardly an international summit has taken place without the accompaniment of protests .
anti-globalization demonstrations are especially common during these meetings as a historical overview shows .

mario ohoven said he could not relate to the social democrats ’ election manifesto and felt the spd leadership ’ s recent attempts to woo back leftist supporters had resulted in too many amendments to its social and economic reform course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz müntefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections " the spd election manifesto contains too many populist promises , " ohoven said .
" we 've always supported the chancellor ’ s reform agenda , but now we see this agenda being watered down further .
such incoherence won ’ t help us or the spd in the long run . " less bureaucracy ohoven said he wanted the consolidation of the federal budget to remain a top priority .
he added that the government would do well to prune away at the jungle of bureaucratic rules that was making life almost impossible for small and medium-sized firms , which he said are the backbone of the national economy . " each person in a small company spends about 60 hours a year to fill in statistical data sheets in line with state-level or community-level regulations , " ohoven said .
" this is only one example of germany 's rampant bureaucracy .
every labor-related regulation which the government has scrapped in recent years has been followed by three new stipulations .
no one is able to keep track of them anymore without constantly seeking expensive legal advice from consultants .
that ’ s not the way to move forward . " small business owners are also demanding tax reforms to free them from the high tax rates imposed on larger , transnational firms .
they have also requested tax exemptions for profits which are reinvested in the modernization of the production cycle . " over the past few years , some two million new jobs have been created in small and medium-sized companies in germany , " said ohoven .
" over the same period , large companies have axed about the same amount of jobs .
but with more favorable frameworks in place , we could have done much better .
small business owners would liketo employ more staff when the order books are full , but the prospect of not being able to temporarily dismiss workers when the going gets rough has prevented many employers from doing so . ” waiting on opposition platform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is due to unveil the cdu 's election platform next week ohoven said his criticism of the spd ’ s election manifesto did not necessarily mean he would be advising the association 's members to vote for the opposition conservatives should an early election come about in september . he said he is looking forward to hearing what the christian democrats have to offer small business owners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2005 london named 2012 olympic host city großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : londoners celebrate the announcement from the ioc london was announced as the host city for the 2012 olympic summer games , beating paris in one of the hardest fought and closest bidding campaigns in the history of the games . london has beaten paris to the finishing line in the race to become the host city of the 2012 olympic games .
the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .
the olympics in 2012 will be hosted by the first among equals . " real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .
athletes had to make do with using schools , government buildings and military barracks . in addition , food was still rationed so competitors were asked to bring their own supplies and donate any leftovers to hospitals .
wembley stadium , which survived the bombings , was fitted with a temporary running track and used as the main venue . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris , london bicker over olympic bid as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other .

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .

i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .
instead , once the fighting ended , the british capital was invited to hold the 1948 games , which gathered together 4,099 athletes from 59 countries , although defeated states germany and japan were not invited . with the capital still struggling to recover from the damage dealt by nightly air raids during the war , there was no olympic village .
athletes had to make do with using schools , government buildings and military barracks . in addition , food was still rationed so competitors were asked to bring their own supplies and donate any leftovers to hospitals .

nor did a morning bomb scare at the local branch of the bank of scotland that saw a stretch of the main road sealed off for two hours .
the premises were searched but nothing was found , a police spokesman said . bildunterschrift : peace protesters gather at the fence surrounding the royal navy submarine base at faslane , scotland , monday july 4 , 2005 .
campaigners say they expect thousands of activists to join the planned blockade of faslane naval base on the river clyde .
demonstrations are due to take place throughout the day at the nuclear base in protest at the amount of money spent by g8 countries on weaponry . " a big damp squib .
that 's what we want , " hoped diane lockhart at the door of the salon 20-20 hairdressing parlor , taking in the passing parade of police and international news media waiting for the summit to begin . tayside police chief constable john vine tried to be reassuring , even as more than 10,000 officers fanned out over scotland for the biggest security operation of its kind ever seen in britain . " we will deal robustly with any people who want to break the law .
let 's make that very clear , " vine , whose jurisdiction takes in gleneagles and auchterarder , told reporters . he noted that the time , route and size of wednesday 's march has been negotiated with its organizers , the leftist g8 alternatives coalition , in contrast to the spontaneous protests in the scottish capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2005 industry criticizes spd election manifesto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business owners were hoping for better news from the chancellor german industry representatives have sharply criticized the election manifesto presented by the social democrats on tuesday , calling it incoherent and unlikely to bring about a much-needed economic upswing . the president of the german association of small and medium-sized businesses -lrb- bvmw -rrb- criticized the spd ’ s plans , saying they would not ensure a sustainable economic recovery .
mario ohoven said he could not relate to the social democrats ’ election manifesto and felt the spd leadership ’ s recent attempts to woo back leftist supporters had resulted in too many amendments to its social and economic reform course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz müntefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections " the spd election manifesto contains too many populist promises , " ohoven said .
" we 've always supported the chancellor ’ s reform agenda , but now we see this agenda being watered down further .
such incoherence won ’ t help us or the spd in the long run . " less bureaucracy ohoven said he wanted the consolidation of the federal budget to remain a top priority .
he added that the government would do well to prune away at the jungle of bureaucratic rules that was making life almost impossible for small and medium-sized firms , which he said are the backbone of the national economy . " each person in a small company spends about 60 hours a year to fill in statistical data sheets in line with state-level or community-level regulations , " ohoven said .
" this is only one example of germany 's rampant bureaucracy .
every labor-related regulation which the government has scrapped in recent years has been followed by three new stipulations .
no one is able to keep track of them anymore without constantly seeking expensive legal advice from consultants .
that ’ s not the way to move forward . " small business owners are also demanding tax reforms to free them from the high tax rates imposed on larger , transnational firms .
they have also requested tax exemptions for profits which are reinvested in the modernization of the production cycle . " over the past few years , some two million new jobs have been created in small and medium-sized companies in germany , " said ohoven .
" over the same period , large companies have axed about the same amount of jobs .
but with more favorable frameworks in place , we could have done much better .
small business owners would liketo employ more staff when the order books are full , but the prospect of not being able to temporarily dismiss workers when the going gets rough has prevented many employers from doing so . ” waiting on opposition platform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is due to unveil the cdu 's election platform next week ohoven said his criticism of the spd ’ s election manifesto did not necessarily mean he would be advising the association 's members to vote for the opposition conservatives should an early election come about in september . he said he is looking forward to hearing what the christian democrats have to offer small business owners .

the english capital becomes the first city to host the games for the third time . ioc president jacques rogge announced the winner at 13:45 cet in a worldwide television broadcast . the two cities reached the final round after the ioc rank and file eliminated moscow , new york and madrid . the cities have been going head-to-head for the final few weeks of campaigning .
british prime minister tony blair spent two days in singapore , having private one-to-one meeting with ioc members in a bid to win over doubters .
french president jacques chirac jetted into singapore on tuesday afternoon for a lightning round of lobbying ahead of wednesday 's vote . candidates eliminated over three rounds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow , who went out in the first round , new york , the second , and madrid , in the third , have been considered outsiders as the ioc got nearer to the vote . london mayor ken livingstone told the sporting world from the ioc event in singapore that the capital would deliver .
" we will promise you a games you will never forget . " british rowing olympian matthew pinsent added : " this is so special ...
it was four votes between winning and losing - as close as our race in athens ...
the emotion in the last couple of hours has been incredible . " bildunterschrift : as london celebrated , there was huge disappointment for the paris bid which had been the frontrunner from the start of the process over two years ago .
philippe baudillon , chief executive of the paris bid could barely hide his feelings .
" we are very , very disappointed but it was a very good competition .
we thought we could win but obviously we did not ...
that 's life . " unlucky candidates look to the future personalities from the other failed bids took the opportunity to comment on the decision of the ioc .
billy payne , former head of the atlanta olympic committee that staged the 1996 summer games said that new york had a great bid and he hoped the experience would not put the city off running in the future .
" i was so proud of them ...
i just hope they have the patience and the commitment to go on to 2016 , and i promise that if they show that tenacity ... we 'll see the games come back to the united states and probably in the city of new york . " russian supporters had not even been told that russia had been eliminated by the time the announcement of london 's success was broadcast .
bemused spectators listened as leonid miroshnichenko , secretary general of russia 's bid , commented on the failed attempt .
" we feel moscow still needs the development and will build the sports facilities we plan to do .
we lost today but it does n't mean we lost the future , we will be bidding again . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor yuri luzhkov added : " it was an equal competition and we put in our best and fought the battle .
the olympics in 2012 will be hosted by the first among equals . " real madrid soccer striker raul , in singapore to support the spanish capital 's bid spoke of his hopes for the future after madrid was eliminated in the third round : " we must be proud of all the people who defended this candidacy ...
i think madrid will go on fighting because it deserves to be an olympic city . " an olympic history of glory and scandal london has staged the games twice before , in 1908 , when the contest was shaken by judging scandals , and 1948 , in the aftermath of world war ii . in 1906 , london was asked to hold the olympics instead of rome , which was suddenly forced to pull out after mount vesuvius erupted .
despite having just two years to prepare , london proved to be an innovative host , introducing qualifying rounds and forcing countries to limit the number of competitors they put forward . the 1908 games , which ran from april 27 until october 31 , however , were marred by international politics and problems with judging . finnish athletes were told to march under the soviet union flag , and irish competitors who wanted to represent ireland were ordered to compete on britain 's behalf . the biggest drama occurred in the 400 meter race , when us runner j.c. carpenter , who crossed the finish line first , was disqualified for obstructing the british competitor , wyndham halswelle .
complicating matters , britain and the united states had different rules on obstruction , and , while the final was re-run , carpenter and two other us athletes refused to take part so halswelle had to sprint round the track alone .
in the end , us runner john hayes - who came second in the original race - was awarded the gold after the american team formally complained . some 2,035 athletes , representing 22 countries , took part in london 's first olympics , but only 36 of these competitors were women . a cocktail of controversial decisions during the games prompted the establishment of the international amateur athletic federation , which standardized track and field competition rules . postwar olympics advances games stature in 1939 , london was once again asked to host the prestigious event but the 1944 olympics were cancelled after the outbreak of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.07.2005 leaders in a stew over culinary heritage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac does n't think much of fish and chips french president jacques chirac flies into scotland on wednesday for the g8 summit after allegedly slamming british cuisine .
battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .

battle lines have been drawn for what is turning out to be an embarrassing eu food fight . european leaders are becoming increasingly embroiled in what may possibly be the most inappropriate and petty row the eu has ever manufactured .
as the leaders of the world 's most powerful nations arrive for the g8 conference in gleneagles in scotland , to discuss amongst other things the eradication of poverty and starvation in africa , leading european figures are sniping at each other over their countries ' cuisine . the food fight began when reports surfaced from the french-german-russian summit on sunday that french president jacques chirac had made it clear that he was dreading the g8 summit because of the ghastliness of british cuisine saying that britain was " after finland , the country with the worst food " .
he added that the " the only thing -lrb- the british -rrb- have done for european agriculture is ' mad cow " ' . chirac was also quoted as linking the trustworthiness of the british to the standard of their food .
the french daily liberation quoted chirac as saying to german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin on sunday that " you ca n't trust people who cook as badly as that . " french officials monday dismissed the report of the " mad cow " comments but stopped short of issuing a categorical denial . food comments add to growing rift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac with a star french chef the french president 's timing was as impeccable as ever .
as well as facing off with the british about their perceived culinary shortcomings , chirac is involved in a potentially damaging face-off with british prime minister tony blair over european farm subsidies and the british eu rebate which could become a sideshow at gleneagles this week .
he was also pitted against his british rival in singapore where paris and london are contesting in the final rounds off the ioc 's olympic host city bid . chirac 's comments have had a knock-on effect throughout the eu with the offended parties of britain and finland firing back and other leaders dodging the flying baguettes with well chosen words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor and confirmed currywurst fan gerhard schröder declined on tuesday to wade into the food fight saying only he was looking forward to the scottish venue 's cuisine .
when asked about the reported comments by french president chirac the german leader flashed a broad grin and said he would not confirm the remarks but added he had his own thoughts about the g8 summit menu .
" i am no friend of salmon and i hope i get a proper steak , " he quipped . british press give chirac both barrels however , the british and finnish press were more than prepared to add some ammunition to the expanding bunfight .
the daily telegraph suggested that president chirac " seems to have gone a little off his rocker " before using the food row as a way into further exchanges on agricultural policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has no problem with a quick toast taking umbrage against the claim that britons could not be trusted because of their bad food , the telegraph said : " again , mr. chirac is lagging behind the times .
even the most chauvinistic french chefs now acknowledge that london overtook paris long ago as the culinary capital of europe . " french president 's sanity questioned an editorial in the daily express ran with the headline " give chirac humble pie " and then began with " has president jacques chirac completely lost his marbles ? "
it said chirac acted in a " colossal fit of pique " because he can not forgive prime minister tony blair for refusing to yield to french demands on britain 's rebate from the eu and now hopes paris beats london in the race to host the 2012 olympic games .
" he is an international statesman and should behave as such , " it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the express hoped chirac " remembers his manners " on wednesday evening when he is guest of queen elizabeth ii at a dinner she is hosting for the group of eight leaders .
" as for her majesty , it would be quite understandable if she were tempted to reply to his rudeness with a plate of beans on toast .
on his head , " the paper jibed . britain 's biggest selling newspaper the sun commented that chirac " plumbs a new depth . "
" his snide attacks on britain expose him once and for all as a nasty , petty , racist creep , " it said . finns defend cuisine , the finnish press came to the defense of the nordic country 's cuisine laying much of the blame on foreigners ' ignorance of finland 's culinary traditions .
" the comments by jacques chirac can only be explained by the fact that he has not visited finland often enough and that he listens too much to silvio berlusconi " , the daily ilta-sanomat said . last june , after finland lost out to italy as home for the new european food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- headquarters , berlusconi quipped that in order to compete with the finns he had to " put up with " finnish cooking . hans valimaki , owner of helsinki 's prestigious restaurant chez dominique , recipient of two michelin stars , hit back at the french .
" it is also true that the french are the dirtiest people .
they do not buy a lot of soap and for that our president will not insult them . " he said , quoted by ilta-sanomat , adding that finland should launch a campaign to promote its cuisine . finnish politician challenges chirac to dinner and jacques chirac may be forced to eat his own words by finnish european lawmaker alexander stubb .
the husband of a british woman , stubb has invited chirac to dinner where a combination of british and finnish cuisine will be on the menu . " our finnish-british family has ... paid close attention to your negative image of the cuisines of our native countries , " stubb wrote in an open letter to chirac , promising " authentic finnish and british ingredients in order to avoid disappointment " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac can look forward to fish and chips if he visits stubb 's home in belgium , but not any old fish and chips - roe of vendace with lapland potato chips await him .
if rack of baby lamb from aland with nettle mash does not tempt him , finnish berries marinated in arctic brambleberry wine with beestings pudding surely will . stubb was thoughtful enough to allow chirac to show off the glories of the french table if he takes up the offer .

but experts in germany remain divided over the best way to help the continent out of poverty . hundreds of thousands of people grooved to some of germany 's favorite bands last weekend at the berlin live 8 concert to raise awareness of poverty .
and while most admitted coming out to enjoy the music , there was also some thought of the poor in africa . " yes , it 's true that i came to enjoy the music and the day , " said sebastian hovermann , 22 , of berlin .
" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others . " while he admitted to knowing little about debt relief and other complicated development issues , he , and others in the audience , cheered performers ' calls for increased development aid to africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want to help africa the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives from about 70 euros a year .
learning from the past in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
and in the future , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rapid spread of hiv has created hundreds of thousands of " aids orphans " as a result , the international development community , including the world bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent 's needs .
they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work . " other ngo officials applaud the g8 development initiatives and say an increase in aid to africa could make a real difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says that corruption is key obstacle to african economic development " the millennium development goals are modest ones and yet we are off-track , " said peter eigen , the head of berlin-based transparency international , an ngo devoted to fighting corruption internationally .
" that is why what is going on at gleneages is very important . " eigen cautioned that financial assistance is not enough . " the greatest enemy to economic development is corruption , which aims at buying the wrong decisions and mismanages resources , " he added .
" that does n't mean that corrupt societies do n't deserve our support .
but there has to be a parallel effort in the north and the south for aid to work and both sides need to come through . "
regardless , the outcome of the two-day gleneagles meeting will be closely watched by those in the developing world as a sign of the rich world 's commitments to meet the millennium development goals and its desire to help the world 's poor . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work . " other ngo officials applaud the g8 development initiatives and say an increase in aid to africa could make a real difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says that corruption is key obstacle to african economic development " the millennium development goals are modest ones and yet we are off-track , " said peter eigen , the head of berlin-based transparency international , an ngo devoted to fighting corruption internationally .
" that is why what is going on at gleneages is very important . " eigen cautioned that financial assistance is not enough . " the greatest enemy to economic development is corruption , which aims at buying the wrong decisions and mismanages resources , " he added .
" that does n't mean that corrupt societies do n't deserve our support .
but there has to be a parallel effort in the north and the south for aid to work and both sides need to come through . "
regardless , the outcome of the two-day gleneagles meeting will be closely watched by those in the developing world as a sign of the rich world 's commitments to meet the millennium development goals and its desire to help the world 's poor . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

nor did a morning bomb scare at the local branch of the bank of scotland that saw a stretch of the main road sealed off for two hours .
the premises were searched but nothing was found , a police spokesman said . bildunterschrift : peace protesters gather at the fence surrounding the royal navy submarine base at faslane , scotland , monday july 4 , 2005 .
campaigners say they expect thousands of activists to join the planned blockade of faslane naval base on the river clyde .
demonstrations are due to take place throughout the day at the nuclear base in protest at the amount of money spent by g8 countries on weaponry . " a big damp squib .
that 's what we want , " hoped diane lockhart at the door of the salon 20-20 hairdressing parlor , taking in the passing parade of police and international news media waiting for the summit to begin . tayside police chief constable john vine tried to be reassuring , even as more than 10,000 officers fanned out over scotland for the biggest security operation of its kind ever seen in britain . " we will deal robustly with any people who want to break the law .
let 's make that very clear , " vine , whose jurisdiction takes in gleneagles and auchterarder , told reporters . he noted that the time , route and size of wednesday 's march has been negotiated with its organizers , the leftist g8 alternatives coalition , in contrast to the spontaneous protests in the scottish capital . " we have large numbers of police officers who are well prepared and well equipped should anything arise , " he said . residents behind the cause protests aside , one of the summit 's core issues - battling poverty in africa - has clearly struck a chord in auchterarder , with many shops sporting " make trade history " signs . a global village cafe is up and running for the week - " proceeds to wind-powered pumps for africa " - while the glendevon pub is laying on a " make poverty history " buffet featuring scotland 's national dish , haggis . " we 've all got our opinions , " said the pub 's owner kevin grigsby , who nevertheless is n't boarding up his windows because " it looks too tacky . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland bernadette malone , chief executive of perthshire council , the local authority , said the g8 summit would be " worthwhile " if it can boost the region 's international profile for tourism and conventions . but she pointed out that prime minister tony blair , the summit 's host , never consulted local people before selecting gleneagles more than a year ago as the place to welcome his fellow world leaders . if it is any consolation , auchterarder can take comfort in the fact that , amidst mccallum 's butcher shop , the bear necessities charity shop and the golf inn pub , there is not one mcdonald 's or starbucks outlet on the main road to lure the attention - or stones - of an anti-capitalist troublemaker . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.07.2005 africa needs help , but how ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the us say more aid wo n't reach the right people the g8 summit kicks off wednesday in the wake of rock concerts and calls for increased aid and debt relief for africa .
but experts in germany remain divided over the best way to help the continent out of poverty . hundreds of thousands of people grooved to some of germany 's favorite bands last weekend at the berlin live 8 concert to raise awareness of poverty .
and while most admitted coming out to enjoy the music , there was also some thought of the poor in africa . " yes , it 's true that i came to enjoy the music and the day , " said sebastian hovermann , 22 , of berlin .
" but this concert is also an important reminder that we have it good in this country and need to help others . " while he admitted to knowing little about debt relief and other complicated development issues , he , and others in the audience , cheered performers ' calls for increased development aid to africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want to help africa the statistics are grim : in sierra leone , three out of 10 children die before the age of five .
in niger , only 17 percent of the population can read .
in mali , half of all children under the age of 14 work .
the average ethiopian does not have access to clean water and lives from about 70 euros a year .
learning from the past in the past decade , development aid , debt relief , and economic growth in sub-saharan africa have risen but " reducing poverty remains a challenge , " according to the world bank 's annual report on africa .
and in the future , the rapid spread of hiv , insufficient aid and investment flows , weak commodity prices and a lack of trade opportunities could reverse gains .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rapid spread of hiv has created hundreds of thousands of " aids orphans " as a result , the international development community , including the world bank and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , has dubbed 2005 the " year of africa " to call attention to the continent 's needs .
they suggest that with the july g8 meeting , a un summit in september on the " millennium goals " aimed at cutting poverty and a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in december looking at fair trading practices , africa could have a real chance to get on track .
" we made mistakes in the past but development cooperation is different today , " said reinhard hermle , chairman of the board of the association of german development ngos -lrb- venro -rrb- in bonn .
" we are no longer pouring millions into a bottomless pit but working with african leaders , a good number of whom have become aware of their responsibilities to their people .
so i think , hope , that 2005 will be different . "
some relief on the way this week 's g8 meeting 's agenda will include the development challenges facing sub-saharan africa , climate change and debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .
the leaders will also try to assess progress on the millennium development goals , a set of eight targets intended to halve poverty in the developing world by 2015 .
progress on these aims has been " slow and uneven , " according to the global monitoring report , a world bank / imf publication .
in africa , there is no way to meet the targets at the current rate of progress , the report adds .
the g8 participants will also assess available resources and new mechanisms aimed at lifting billions of people out of poverty .
in early june , the g8 finance ministers agreed to 100 percent debt relief for the world 's poorest nations - 14 of which are african - totaling 33 billion euros .
they also agreed to add nine more countries for additional relief over the next 18 months and another 11 afterwards for another 12 billion euros .
a " marshall plan " for africa while debt relief is supported by the g8 countries , a " marshall plan for africa " as envisioned by british prime minister tony blair is more controversial .
his aim is to double the amount of development assistance to africa , cuurently at about 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants to double african development aid " in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases everyday , it is our duty to act and we will , " said blair during a meeting with us president george w. bush . but bush and other leaders such as german chancellor gerhard schröder say that recipient countries are just not able to handle the increased aid . " of course we want to double development assistance to africa , " uschi eid , the german government 's official responsible for african affairs , told reporters .
" but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work . "
wasted aid ? many within and outside the development community argue that while hundreds of billions have poured into africa over the past three decades , it has made little difference for a variety of reasons , including corruption , inappropriate projects and a lack of true commitment .
development assistance needs to be more carefully planned and executed for it to work . " the british plan pushing for more aid is a generous one , " said andre carvelho , chief of program development at united nations volunteers in bonn .
" but if this increase goes through conventional government channels , it probably wo n't work . " other ngo officials applaud the g8 development initiatives and say an increase in aid to africa could make a real difference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , says that corruption is key obstacle to african economic development " the millennium development goals are modest ones and yet we are off-track , " said peter eigen , the head of berlin-based transparency international , an ngo devoted to fighting corruption internationally .
" that is why what is going on at gleneages is very important . " eigen cautioned that financial assistance is not enough . " the greatest enemy to economic development is corruption , which aims at buying the wrong decisions and mismanages resources , " he added .
" that does n't mean that corrupt societies do n't deserve our support .
but there has to be a parallel effort in the north and the south for aid to work and both sides need to come through . "
regardless , the outcome of the two-day gleneagles meeting will be closely watched by those in the developing world as a sign of the rich world 's commitments to meet the millennium development goals and its desire to help the world 's poor . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

the advertising standards authority received 272 complaints about the fanta z advert , calling it " disgusting " .
the ad shows people spitting out fanta light , which a voice-over explains does not taste as good as the new fanta z. the asa said it was concerned young children would see the spitting as fun and easy to copy .
coca-cola , which makes fanta z , said the advert was not meant to be offensive .
it agreed to amend the 40-second commercial 's media scheduling to comply with the asa 's ruling .
spitting is widely perceived as anti-social and we could understand why viewers would not want to see children copying this behaviour asa the advert shows a young couple spitting out fanta light during a beach picnic , followed by other people acting in a similar way .
the voice-over says : " we all liked the idea of fanta light , but not everyone liked the taste .
goodbye fanta light , hello fanta z. real fanta taste , zero added sugar . "
several complainants claimed children had mimicked the advert .
after investigating the complaints , the asa said it was concerned young children would see the spitting as fun and easy to copy .
it said : " spitting is widely perceived as anti-social and we could understand why viewers would not want to see children copying this behaviour . "
" ironic " but it did not uphold objections about the advert 's health and safety implications .
it ruled the commercial 's " highly stylised " content was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence .
coca-cola said its target audience was 16 to 24-year-olds who would understand its " ironic " message .
in a statement given after the ruling , it said it welcomed the asa 's " recognition that the fanta z advert creative , which focuses on turning a series of classic drinking scenarios on its head , is clearly fictitious " .
the latest row follows the asa 's rejection last month of complaints about a kfc advert which showed people singing with their mouths full .
more than 1,600 people complained about the kfc commercial for the fast food chain 's zinger crunch salad , saying it encouraged bad manners .
but in that case the asa ruled it was unlikely to promote bad manners among children .

ahmad kholwadia first tried competitive gaming last year competitive gaming is a rapidly growing phenomenon that gets bigger and more popular each year , yet there are many sceptics out there who laugh at the mere notion that it can be classed as a sport .
people need to look at competitive gaming differently to football , rugby or tennis because you can not compare it to physical sports .
competitive gaming is a brand new sport , which may not challenge an individual physically , but there is no doubting its mental challenge .
snooker and darts are classed as sports , but neither sport contains a physical challenge .
so why can not competitive gaming be classed a sport also ?
maybe it is the stigma still attached to gaming that portrays a dedicated gamer as an anti-social reject .
this may have been true 15 to 20 years ago but gaming has evolved past the stage of bedroom loners .
nerves and skills during a recent debate with a fellow gamer , i was told that it could only be classed as sport if people got paid or sponsored to play games .
the paris competition brings together the world 's top gamers for a privileged few , including uk counter strike team 4kings -lrb- who will be representing the uk at the upcoming electronic sports world cup in paris -rrb- , and world famous professional gamer fatal1ty , this is already a reality .
gaming , like any other sport , requires a lot of dedication to be able to compete at the highest level .
training for a major event like the electronic sports world cup -lrb- eswc -rrb- involves practising with friends and other gamers -lrb- locally or online -rrb- , or competing at smaller tournaments to build up competitive gaming experience .
speaking from personal experience , i can tell you that playing from the comfort of your home and competing at a major event are two totally different things .
at home you are competing only against your opponent with nothing or very little at stake but at a major tournament you are competing against your nerves , pressure and a highly skilled opponent which has made many a gamer let the whole event get the better of him or her .
i experienced my first international event last year at the eswc 2004 and unfortunately i was not prepared for the occasion .
the competition was very high and much better than all the local and national tournaments that i competed in before .
love of the game but the experience really opened my eyes to gaming and showed me that there are many people out there who are as dedicated to games as i am .
ahmad kholwadia is the uk 's pro evo soccer champion they all shared my love of games and spent a lot of their time perfecting their game but still managed to live normal lives with jobs , education , friends and a social life .
now my second international event is the nvidia-sponsored eswc 2005 in paris , where i aim to put my pro evolution soccer 4 skills to the ultimate test .
gaming should never take over a person 's life but if you want to be a truly great gamer you must put in a lot of effort just like you would in football , rugby or tennis .
before you attempt to compete at a major event , you must have a genuine love of the game .
start by competing against mates then try your skills at a local event .
if you are still interested then take it one step further and compete nationally and finally put your gaming skills to the ultimate test at a major international event .
at the very least , you will make some new friends , and who knows , maybe even some money .
ahmad kholwadia , aka asian hawk , is the uk 's pro evolution soccer 4 champion and is competing in the international finals of the electronic sports world cup -lrb- eswc -rrb- in paris , which runs from 6 to 10 july 2005 .

ahmad kholwadia first tried competitive gaming last year competitive gaming is a rapidly growing phenomenon that gets bigger and more popular each year , yet there are many sceptics out there who laugh at the mere notion that it can be classed as a sport .
people need to look at competitive gaming differently to football , rugby or tennis because you can not compare it to physical sports .
competitive gaming is a brand new sport , which may not challenge an individual physically , but there is no doubting its mental challenge .
snooker and darts are classed as sports , but neither sport contains a physical challenge .
so why can not competitive gaming be classed a sport also ?
maybe it is the stigma still attached to gaming that portrays a dedicated gamer as an anti-social reject .
this may have been true 15 to 20 years ago but gaming has evolved past the stage of bedroom loners .
nerves and skills during a recent debate with a fellow gamer , i was told that it could only be classed as sport if people got paid or sponsored to play games .
the paris competition brings together the world 's top gamers for a privileged few , including uk counter strike team 4kings -lrb- who will be representing the uk at the upcoming electronic sports world cup in paris -rrb- , and world famous professional gamer fatal1ty , this is already a reality .
gaming , like any other sport , requires a lot of dedication to be able to compete at the highest level .
training for a major event like the electronic sports world cup -lrb- eswc -rrb- involves practising with friends and other gamers -lrb- locally or online -rrb- , or competing at smaller tournaments to build up competitive gaming experience .
speaking from personal experience , i can tell you that playing from the comfort of your home and competing at a major event are two totally different things .
at home you are competing only against your opponent with nothing or very little at stake but at a major tournament you are competing against your nerves , pressure and a highly skilled opponent which has made many a gamer let the whole event get the better of him or her .
i experienced my first international event last year at the eswc 2004 and unfortunately i was not prepared for the occasion .
the competition was very high and much better than all the local and national tournaments that i competed in before .
love of the game but the experience really opened my eyes to gaming and showed me that there are many people out there who are as dedicated to games as i am .
ahmad kholwadia is the uk 's pro evo soccer champion they all shared my love of games and spent a lot of their time perfecting their game but still managed to live normal lives with jobs , education , friends and a social life .
now my second international event is the nvidia-sponsored eswc 2005 in paris , where i aim to put my pro evolution soccer 4 skills to the ultimate test .
gaming should never take over a person 's life but if you want to be a truly great gamer you must put in a lot of effort just like you would in football , rugby or tennis .
before you attempt to compete at a major event , you must have a genuine love of the game .
start by competing against mates then try your skills at a local event .
if you are still interested then take it one step further and compete nationally and finally put your gaming skills to the ultimate test at a major international event .
at the very least , you will make some new friends , and who knows , maybe even some money .

love of the game but the experience really opened my eyes to gaming and showed me that there are many people out there who are as dedicated to games as i am .
ahmad kholwadia is the uk 's pro evo soccer champion they all shared my love of games and spent a lot of their time perfecting their game but still managed to live normal lives with jobs , education , friends and a social life .
now my second international event is the nvidia-sponsored eswc 2005 in paris , where i aim to put my pro evolution soccer 4 skills to the ultimate test .
gaming should never take over a person 's life but if you want to be a truly great gamer you must put in a lot of effort just like you would in football , rugby or tennis .
before you attempt to compete at a major event , you must have a genuine love of the game .
start by competing against mates then try your skills at a local event .
if you are still interested then take it one step further and compete nationally and finally put your gaming skills to the ultimate test at a major international event .
at the very least , you will make some new friends , and who knows , maybe even some money .
ahmad kholwadia , aka asian hawk , is the uk 's pro evolution soccer 4 champion and is competing in the international finals of the electronic sports world cup -lrb- eswc -rrb- in paris , which runs from 6 to 10 july 2005 .

speaking from personal experience , i can tell you that playing from the comfort of your home and competing at a major event are two totally different things .

andy cato of dance act groove armada has teamed up with o2 in the uk to offer tracks for download to mobiles .
" if this works , it 'll give left-of-centre music a presence in a potentially large market place , " he said .
mobile operators and handset makers are scrambling to provide music to mobiles , turning them into portable jukeboxes .
sony ericsson is bringing out a range of walkman-branded phones , while motorola is working on an itunes-compatible mobile with apple .
quick turnaround while many people own digital music players , often the one gadget they carry all the time is the mobile phone .
as mobiles become more sophisticated and offer more storage space , the industry is looking at ways of tapping into people 's appetite for digital music on the go .
artists such as andy cato , whose band groove armada is known for hits such as superstylin ' , see this as an opportunity to sell tracks to fans quickly , without relying on a record label .
as a solo artist , he is free to make his own music deals , although groove armada will continue to make records and tour together .
it means he will get a far greater share of the revenues , which will be shared with o2 .
" with labels , it is impossible to calculate how much you get per song , " he explained .
" when you do , you weep . "
cato is going to offer two tracks a week for download to mobiles from friday 8 july , costing £ 1 each .
" what appeals in terms of dance music is the speed of the turnaround , " he said , recalling the early days of dance music when new tunes made their way to the clubs within days of being produced .
" working on a new track on a monday and releasing it on a friday is an adrenaline-fuelled way of working , " he told the bbc news website .
he is also planning to work with other music producers to help them distribute music by mobile .
' incredibly annoying ' unlike other tracks offered by the o2 music service , andy cato 's tunes will not have any digital rights protection -lrb- drm -rrb- .
it means fans will be able to transfer them without constraints to a pc or burn them to a cd .
it also means that there is nothing to stop them appearing on file-sharing networks .
cato admitted he was " incredibly annoyed " when he saw groove armada songs illegally being shared online .
describing himself as a luddite , he said he had not heard of drm until he was flown into london from ibiza to promote the o2 service .
but he added that trying to stop illegal copying of tracks with technology or lawsuits was " like trying to hold back the tide " .
groove armada fans could be frustrated as cato 's tracks will only be available through o2 's music service , which only currently works on two handsets , the siemens sx1 and the new o2 xm mobile .
music scramble for o2 , music downloads are the latest salvo in the battle to win over consumers .
just about everyone in the mobile industry seems to be making plans to jump on the digital music bandwagon .
sony ericsson has joined forces with online music service napster to develop a service for mobiles .
and rival motorola has partnered with apple to create a mobile tied in to the itunes music store .
handset manufacturers such as nokia are working on mobiles designed for digital entertainment .
and sony ericsson will launch the first of its walkman branded phones , the w800i , in august .
it is seeking to take advantage of the popularity of dance act jamiroquai to market the phones .
but there still some hurdles in the way of music on mobiles .
some people may have trouble transferring tracks from mobiles to a pc , and there are also issues about competing file formats for mobile downloads .
analysts say that mobile phones still have some way to go before they replace more established music players like the ipod .
