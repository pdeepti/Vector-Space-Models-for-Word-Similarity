that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 21.08.2005 " it 's still an open race " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm an expert in surviving predictions " with less than a month of campaigning left , opinion polls are showing the current coalition of social democrats and greens lagging far behind .
dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .

we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .
we have that kind of thing in other european countries .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .

when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .

they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .

it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .

calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .
we have that kind of thing in other european countries .
i find it awful ; there are worlds between us in this respect . continue reading to find out about how fischer views germany 's future foreign policy goals . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

there 's not a single month in the year where it does n't snow .
today , it was -11 celsius -lrb- 12 f -rrb- and there was snow on the ground , so the first thing i had to do was shovel the snow and throw sand .
after that , i did my normal work .
i set up the cabins on the cablecar and check that they are operational .
i also turn on the lights and the machines that read the tickets .
and then i check if the cablecar cable has to be de-iced .
ticket please ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august weather on the zugspitze can be fiercely cold after i 've eaten breakfast , around 7 a.m. , i do a test run on the cablecar .
i ride it from the summit to the base station to make sure everything is alright .
if nothing is wrong , then i ride back to the top , frequently with the first guests .
on the test run to the bottom , my wife rides along .
the night before , she takes the last gondola up .
she works as a cleaning lady on the zugspitze , so we see each other every day .
during the day , i am responsible for the visitors who are descending from the summit .
i stand at the gate on the first floor where the cars go back down and check the customers ' tickets .
aside from that , if there 's any small thing that needs doing , like changing a light bulb in the restroom , i do that too .
if it 's something bigger , then i call up a repairman .

i take the next-to-last gondola down the mountain , officially that 's 4:45 pm but sometimes it is n't until 7:00 pm .
as a rule , i stay at the top until the last visitor has left .
with the last gondola , i ride back to the summit with my wife .
while she goes about her business , i check everything one more time .
the station is shut down , the electricity turned off , all the doors that lead outdoors are locked and the lights turned off .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.08.2005 ecclesiastical economics : the pax bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bishopric of cologne has its own bank the church today may not possess the wealth it once did , but there is still a demand for financial services with a christian touch .
the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .
" our business is shaped by christian values , and atheists ca n't open an account here .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 21.08.2005 " it 's still an open race " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm an expert in surviving predictions " with less than a month of campaigning left , opinion polls are showing the current coalition of social democrats and greens lagging far behind .
dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .
" our business is shaped by christian values , and atheists ca n't open an account here .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .

so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .

a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .

and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .
we have that kind of thing in other european countries .
i find it awful ; there are worlds between us in this respect . continue reading to find out about how fischer views germany 's future foreign policy goals . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

he is the manager of germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
he tells dw-world what it 's like when the air is thin every workday . my workplace is at a height of 2,940 meters -lrb- 9,640 feet -rrb- .
i am the so-called summit manager for the " bayerische zugspitzbahn bergbahn " on the zugspitze , germany 's highest mountain -lrb- 2962 m -rrb- .
we operate the summit station , the lifts and the restaurants on the mountain .
everything ok ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred feldmeier at his workplace during the week , i live on the mountaintop in a company apartment .
depending on weather conditions , i wake up between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m.
there 's not a single month in the year where it does n't snow .
today , it was -11 celsius -lrb- 12 f -rrb- and there was snow on the ground , so the first thing i had to do was shovel the snow and throw sand .
after that , i did my normal work .
i set up the cabins on the cablecar and check that they are operational .
i also turn on the lights and the machines that read the tickets .
and then i check if the cablecar cable has to be de-iced .
ticket please ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august weather on the zugspitze can be fiercely cold after i 've eaten breakfast , around 7 a.m. , i do a test run on the cablecar .
i ride it from the summit to the base station to make sure everything is alright .
if nothing is wrong , then i ride back to the top , frequently with the first guests .
on the test run to the bottom , my wife rides along .
the night before , she takes the last gondola up .
she works as a cleaning lady on the zugspitze , so we see each other every day .
during the day , i am responsible for the visitors who are descending from the summit .
i stand at the gate on the first floor where the cars go back down and check the customers ' tickets .
aside from that , if there 's any small thing that needs doing , like changing a light bulb in the restroom , i do that too .
if it 's something bigger , then i call up a repairman .
back to the valley bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the post office even delivers and picks up mail from the summit station i usually take a lunch break between 1:30 and 2 p.m. , when i go to my apartment and cook something to eat .
after that it 's back to my workstation .
i take the next-to-last gondola down the mountain , officially that 's 4:45 pm but sometimes it is n't until 7:00 pm .
as a rule , i stay at the top until the last visitor has left .
with the last gondola , i ride back to the summit with my wife .
while she goes about her business , i check everything one more time .
the station is shut down , the electricity turned off , all the doors that lead outdoors are locked and the lights turned off .
my day is over sometime between 8 and 10 pm .
should a mountain climber be in trouble though , then i have to make sure he gets help but , thank god , that does n't happen too often .
hobby : nativity scenes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred feldmeier makes sure the gondolas are in perfect running condition when i am finished eating dinner , i work on my hobby - making nativity scenes .
sometimes my children - i have a son and a daughter - come to visit .
i do n't have any problem working on the mountain , the altitude does n't affect me .
once a day , i have to take a tablet to increase my red blood cell count .
everybody who stays up on the mountain has to do that .
when i have vacation , well , i ca n't stay in the mountains all the time and so i almost always go to the baltic sea .

that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .
" our business is shaped by christian values , and atheists ca n't open an account here .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .
we have that kind of thing in other european countries .
i find it awful ; there are worlds between us in this respect . continue reading to find out about how fischer views germany 's future foreign policy goals . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.08.2005 pope holds mass with one million pilgrims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedikt xvi greets the one million-strong crowd at marienfeld pope benedict xvi sent a crowd of one million young pilgrims home happy from a gigantic open-air mass on sunday , defying his reputation as a cold , distant pontiff who dislikes crowds . the giant service at a former coal mine outside cologne was the final major public appearance of benedict 's first foreign trip as pope , a trip which had been planned for pope john paul ii . but despite a more retiring nature than his charismatic predecessor , the 78-year-old german appeared to have won over the massive crowd , most of whom spent a damp and chilly night at the site to await his return after a prayer vigil in the same location on saturday as the world youth day jamboree built up to its finale . bildunterschrift : pilgrims sleep at the marienfeld pilgrims from all over the world had spent the night at the site where the mass was held . some 700,000 had attended a prayer-vigil with benedict the night before , but the world youth day organizers said the numbers had swelled to " more than one million " by sunday 's mass . though shy and retiring , and lacking the forceful personality of his predecessor john paul ii who reveled in such occasions , benedict appears to have turned a corner in his pontificate and embellished his once rather dry appeal to young people with his first foreign trip . the young crowd gave benedict a noisy reception under a huge canopy of swirling flags when he arrived aboard his popemobile , waving and blessing the crowd . with the roads criss-crossing the site blocked by pilgrims standing to get a glimpse of the mass on giant television screens , benedict apologized for not being able to tour through the faithful in his popemobile . pope calls for mass to become part of youth 's lives bildunterschrift : " i would like to have been able to go through the crowd and greet each and every one of you .
that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .

we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .

they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 21.08.2005 " it 's still an open race " back to first page back 2/2 one of the main objectives of red-green foreign policy has been to get germany a permanent seat on the un security council .
that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .
we have that kind of thing in other european countries .
i find it awful ; there are worlds between us in this respect . continue reading to find out about how fischer views germany 's future foreign policy goals . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.08.2005 pope holds mass with one million pilgrims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedikt xvi greets the one million-strong crowd at marienfeld pope benedict xvi sent a crowd of one million young pilgrims home happy from a gigantic open-air mass on sunday , defying his reputation as a cold , distant pontiff who dislikes crowds . the giant service at a former coal mine outside cologne was the final major public appearance of benedict 's first foreign trip as pope , a trip which had been planned for pope john paul ii . but despite a more retiring nature than his charismatic predecessor , the 78-year-old german appeared to have won over the massive crowd , most of whom spent a damp and chilly night at the site to await his return after a prayer vigil in the same location on saturday as the world youth day jamboree built up to its finale . bildunterschrift : pilgrims sleep at the marienfeld pilgrims from all over the world had spent the night at the site where the mass was held . some 700,000 had attended a prayer-vigil with benedict the night before , but the world youth day organizers said the numbers had swelled to " more than one million " by sunday 's mass . though shy and retiring , and lacking the forceful personality of his predecessor john paul ii who reveled in such occasions , benedict appears to have turned a corner in his pontificate and embellished his once rather dry appeal to young people with his first foreign trip . the young crowd gave benedict a noisy reception under a huge canopy of swirling flags when he arrived aboard his popemobile , waving and blessing the crowd . with the roads criss-crossing the site blocked by pilgrims standing to get a glimpse of the mass on giant television screens , benedict apologized for not being able to tour through the faithful in his popemobile . pope calls for mass to become part of youth 's lives bildunterschrift : " i would like to have been able to go through the crowd and greet each and every one of you .
that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

there 's not a single month in the year where it does n't snow .
today , it was -11 celsius -lrb- 12 f -rrb- and there was snow on the ground , so the first thing i had to do was shovel the snow and throw sand .
after that , i did my normal work .
i set up the cabins on the cablecar and check that they are operational .
i also turn on the lights and the machines that read the tickets .
and then i check if the cablecar cable has to be de-iced .
ticket please ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august weather on the zugspitze can be fiercely cold after i 've eaten breakfast , around 7 a.m. , i do a test run on the cablecar .
i ride it from the summit to the base station to make sure everything is alright .
if nothing is wrong , then i ride back to the top , frequently with the first guests .
on the test run to the bottom , my wife rides along .
the night before , she takes the last gondola up .
she works as a cleaning lady on the zugspitze , so we see each other every day .
during the day , i am responsible for the visitors who are descending from the summit .
i stand at the gate on the first floor where the cars go back down and check the customers ' tickets .

after that it 's back to my workstation .
i take the next-to-last gondola down the mountain , officially that 's 4:45 pm but sometimes it is n't until 7:00 pm .
as a rule , i stay at the top until the last visitor has left .
with the last gondola , i ride back to the summit with my wife .
while she goes about her business , i check everything one more time .
the station is shut down , the electricity turned off , all the doors that lead outdoors are locked and the lights turned off .
my day is over sometime between 8 and 10 pm .

i do n't have any problem working on the mountain , the altitude does n't affect me .
once a day , i have to take a tablet to increase my red blood cell count .

back to the valley bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the post office even delivers and picks up mail from the summit station i usually take a lunch break between 1:30 and 2 p.m. , when i go to my apartment and cook something to eat .
after that it 's back to my workstation .
i take the next-to-last gondola down the mountain , officially that 's 4:45 pm but sometimes it is n't until 7:00 pm .
as a rule , i stay at the top until the last visitor has left .
with the last gondola , i ride back to the summit with my wife .
while she goes about her business , i check everything one more time .
the station is shut down , the electricity turned off , all the doors that lead outdoors are locked and the lights turned off .
my day is over sometime between 8 and 10 pm .
should a mountain climber be in trouble though , then i have to make sure he gets help but , thank god , that does n't happen too often .
hobby : nativity scenes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred feldmeier makes sure the gondolas are in perfect running condition when i am finished eating dinner , i work on my hobby - making nativity scenes .
sometimes my children - i have a son and a daughter - come to visit .
i do n't have any problem working on the mountain , the altitude does n't affect me .
once a day , i have to take a tablet to increase my red blood cell count .
everybody who stays up on the mountain has to do that .
when i have vacation , well , i ca n't stay in the mountains all the time and so i almost always go to the baltic sea .

pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada .

it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .

mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .

i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 21.08.2005 " it 's still an open race " back to first page back 2/2 one of the main objectives of red-green foreign policy has been to get germany a permanent seat on the un security council .
that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.08.2005 ecclesiastical economics : the pax bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bishopric of cologne has its own bank the church today may not possess the wealth it once did , but there is still a demand for financial services with a christian touch .
the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .
" our business is shaped by christian values , and atheists ca n't open an account here .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .
" our business is shaped by christian values , and atheists ca n't open an account here .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .

the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .

that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion .

" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 21.08.2005 " it 's still an open race " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm an expert in surviving predictions " with less than a month of campaigning left , opinion polls are showing the current coalition of social democrats and greens lagging far behind .
dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .
we have that kind of thing in other european countries .
i find it awful ; there are worlds between us in this respect . continue reading to find out about how fischer views germany 's future foreign policy goals . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

" dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .

he is the manager of germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
he tells dw-world what it 's like when the air is thin every workday . my workplace is at a height of 2,940 meters -lrb- 9,640 feet -rrb- .
i am the so-called summit manager for the " bayerische zugspitzbahn bergbahn " on the zugspitze , germany 's highest mountain -lrb- 2962 m -rrb- .
we operate the summit station , the lifts and the restaurants on the mountain .
everything ok ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred feldmeier at his workplace during the week , i live on the mountaintop in a company apartment .
depending on weather conditions , i wake up between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m.
there 's not a single month in the year where it does n't snow .
today , it was -11 celsius -lrb- 12 f -rrb- and there was snow on the ground , so the first thing i had to do was shovel the snow and throw sand .
after that , i did my normal work .
i set up the cabins on the cablecar and check that they are operational .
i also turn on the lights and the machines that read the tickets .
and then i check if the cablecar cable has to be de-iced .
ticket please ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august weather on the zugspitze can be fiercely cold after i 've eaten breakfast , around 7 a.m. , i do a test run on the cablecar .
i ride it from the summit to the base station to make sure everything is alright .
if nothing is wrong , then i ride back to the top , frequently with the first guests .
on the test run to the bottom , my wife rides along .
the night before , she takes the last gondola up .
she works as a cleaning lady on the zugspitze , so we see each other every day .
during the day , i am responsible for the visitors who are descending from the summit .
i stand at the gate on the first floor where the cars go back down and check the customers ' tickets .
aside from that , if there 's any small thing that needs doing , like changing a light bulb in the restroom , i do that too .
if it 's something bigger , then i call up a repairman .
back to the valley bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the post office even delivers and picks up mail from the summit station i usually take a lunch break between 1:30 and 2 p.m. , when i go to my apartment and cook something to eat .
after that it 's back to my workstation .
i take the next-to-last gondola down the mountain , officially that 's 4:45 pm but sometimes it is n't until 7:00 pm .
as a rule , i stay at the top until the last visitor has left .
with the last gondola , i ride back to the summit with my wife .
while she goes about her business , i check everything one more time .
the station is shut down , the electricity turned off , all the doors that lead outdoors are locked and the lights turned off .
my day is over sometime between 8 and 10 pm .
should a mountain climber be in trouble though , then i have to make sure he gets help but , thank god , that does n't happen too often .
hobby : nativity scenes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred feldmeier makes sure the gondolas are in perfect running condition when i am finished eating dinner , i work on my hobby - making nativity scenes .
sometimes my children - i have a son and a daughter - come to visit .
i do n't have any problem working on the mountain , the altitude does n't affect me .
once a day , i have to take a tablet to increase my red blood cell count .
everybody who stays up on the mountain has to do that .
when i have vacation , well , i ca n't stay in the mountains all the time and so i almost always go to the baltic sea .

mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.08.2005 pope holds mass with one million pilgrims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedikt xvi greets the one million-strong crowd at marienfeld pope benedict xvi sent a crowd of one million young pilgrims home happy from a gigantic open-air mass on sunday , defying his reputation as a cold , distant pontiff who dislikes crowds . the giant service at a former coal mine outside cologne was the final major public appearance of benedict 's first foreign trip as pope , a trip which had been planned for pope john paul ii . but despite a more retiring nature than his charismatic predecessor , the 78-year-old german appeared to have won over the massive crowd , most of whom spent a damp and chilly night at the site to await his return after a prayer vigil in the same location on saturday as the world youth day jamboree built up to its finale . bildunterschrift : pilgrims sleep at the marienfeld pilgrims from all over the world had spent the night at the site where the mass was held . some 700,000 had attended a prayer-vigil with benedict the night before , but the world youth day organizers said the numbers had swelled to " more than one million " by sunday 's mass . though shy and retiring , and lacking the forceful personality of his predecessor john paul ii who reveled in such occasions , benedict appears to have turned a corner in his pontificate and embellished his once rather dry appeal to young people with his first foreign trip . the young crowd gave benedict a noisy reception under a huge canopy of swirling flags when he arrived aboard his popemobile , waving and blessing the crowd . with the roads criss-crossing the site blocked by pilgrims standing to get a glimpse of the mass on giant television screens , benedict apologized for not being able to tour through the faithful in his popemobile . pope calls for mass to become part of youth 's lives bildunterschrift : " i would like to have been able to go through the crowd and greet each and every one of you .
that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .
we have that kind of thing in other european countries .
i find it awful ; there are worlds between us in this respect . continue reading to find out about how fischer views germany 's future foreign policy goals . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 21.08.2005 " it 's still an open race " back to first page back 2/2 one of the main objectives of red-green foreign policy has been to get germany a permanent seat on the un security council .
that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .
we have that kind of thing in other european countries .
i find it awful ; there are worlds between us in this respect . continue reading to find out about how fischer views germany 's future foreign policy goals . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .

" dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion .

he is the manager of germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
he tells dw-world what it 's like when the air is thin every workday . my workplace is at a height of 2,940 meters -lrb- 9,640 feet -rrb- .
i am the so-called summit manager for the " bayerische zugspitzbahn bergbahn " on the zugspitze , germany 's highest mountain -lrb- 2962 m -rrb- .
we operate the summit station , the lifts and the restaurants on the mountain .
everything ok ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred feldmeier at his workplace during the week , i live on the mountaintop in a company apartment .
depending on weather conditions , i wake up between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m.
there 's not a single month in the year where it does n't snow .
today , it was -11 celsius -lrb- 12 f -rrb- and there was snow on the ground , so the first thing i had to do was shovel the snow and throw sand .
after that , i did my normal work .
i set up the cabins on the cablecar and check that they are operational .
i also turn on the lights and the machines that read the tickets .
and then i check if the cablecar cable has to be de-iced .
ticket please ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august weather on the zugspitze can be fiercely cold after i 've eaten breakfast , around 7 a.m. , i do a test run on the cablecar .
i ride it from the summit to the base station to make sure everything is alright .
if nothing is wrong , then i ride back to the top , frequently with the first guests .
on the test run to the bottom , my wife rides along .
the night before , she takes the last gondola up .
she works as a cleaning lady on the zugspitze , so we see each other every day .
during the day , i am responsible for the visitors who are descending from the summit .
i stand at the gate on the first floor where the cars go back down and check the customers ' tickets .
aside from that , if there 's any small thing that needs doing , like changing a light bulb in the restroom , i do that too .
if it 's something bigger , then i call up a repairman .
back to the valley bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the post office even delivers and picks up mail from the summit station i usually take a lunch break between 1:30 and 2 p.m. , when i go to my apartment and cook something to eat .
after that it 's back to my workstation .
i take the next-to-last gondola down the mountain , officially that 's 4:45 pm but sometimes it is n't until 7:00 pm .
as a rule , i stay at the top until the last visitor has left .
with the last gondola , i ride back to the summit with my wife .
while she goes about her business , i check everything one more time .
the station is shut down , the electricity turned off , all the doors that lead outdoors are locked and the lights turned off .
my day is over sometime between 8 and 10 pm .
should a mountain climber be in trouble though , then i have to make sure he gets help but , thank god , that does n't happen too often .
hobby : nativity scenes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred feldmeier makes sure the gondolas are in perfect running condition when i am finished eating dinner , i work on my hobby - making nativity scenes .
sometimes my children - i have a son and a daughter - come to visit .
i do n't have any problem working on the mountain , the altitude does n't affect me .
once a day , i have to take a tablet to increase my red blood cell count .
everybody who stays up on the mountain has to do that .
when i have vacation , well , i ca n't stay in the mountains all the time and so i almost always go to the baltic sea .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .
in berlin 's regional government , where the pds shares power with the spd , they are doing the opposite of what they promised .
they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .
additional social benefits are being cut .
a place in a daycare costs you up to some 300 euros a month .
it 's the opposite of what they are promising now . their promises can never be fulfilled .
it 's untrustworthy .
and to top it , oskar lafontaine is reaching out to the far right .
we have that kind of thing in other european countries .
i find it awful ; there are worlds between us in this respect . continue reading to find out about how fischer views germany 's future foreign policy goals . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .
gerhard schröder and i used to sit round the same cabinet table with oskar lafontaine who is one of the leading candidates of the new left party .
when things got tough and he was faced as finance minister with not being able to balance the 2000 budget , he left . the left party 's other leading candidate , gregor gysi , threw in the towel after only a few months as economics minister in berlin 's regional government .
now , they are making empty promises .

they cut so many jobs - it makes you cry .

that has apparently failed because the us and china object .
was that a failure of german diplomacy ? no , not at all .
some people have accused us of bludgeoning tactics .
but that 's not the case .
we did n't plug this issue .
it was kofi annan who said after the iraq war that the un was indispensable , but needed to be reformed , which started the reform debate . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer was a key member in the group of 4 if germany had said : no , we wo n't take part , it would have meant that one of the main pillars of the un would have been saying we 're not interested in reform - even though the previous german government had supported the idea .
so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .
but i 'm not fighting to end up in opposition , but to keep our majority .
i want us to continue to govern this country . foreign minister joschka fischer , leading candidate of the green party , thank you very much . dw-tv 's christian f. trippe interviewed joschka fischer back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the players dw-world takes a detailed look at each party 's top candidates , where they 've been and where they could be going .

so , we could n't have done that .
that 's why we have to stick with it .
i do n't agree that the idea has failed .
it will take more time than some people thought , but it has not failed .
a reform of the un is indispensable if we want peace and stability . and it will be the us which will profit most from an effective un . you are a passionate advocate of turkish eu membership .
but do most germans share your view ?
one of the crises of the eu is that many people say : it 's all going too fast , and every enlargement is only increasing competition in the labor market . look , political responsibility involves having the strength to stand up for one 's convictions , even when people may disagree , and trying to persuade them of what you consider to be right .
we want security and peace . turkey is very close to those regions which pose dangers to our security .
nobody is saying that turkey will become an eu member very quickly or automatically .
we 'll have to decide when turkey is in a position to become part of europe , and that may be in 10 or 20 years . but it 's in our interest to pave the way .
it 's for our security , and that 's what i 'm trying to explain to people .
it 's in keeping with my experience in foreign policy .
the threat is not posed by tank armies in the east anymore , but by terrorism and the nuclear armament race .
the dangers originate in that very region , and the decisive question for us is whether islam , human rights , women 's rights , democracy , the rule of law , - whether islam , civil society and a market economy can go together . bildunterschrift : joschka fischer at the united nations when you look back at your seven years as germany 's foreign minister , what 's your verdict ? it was a time when the old world order had come to an end and new turbulences were felt .
the kosovo war began even before i could take up my post .
and just when we thought we had contained violence on the balkans and were preparing for a new future , there was 9/11 .
nothing has been the same since then . the iraq crisis is lingering on , and europe has weakened itself because france and the netherlands said ' no ' to the european constitution in their referenda . i think it 's necessary to carry on with the enlargement process even though i know that many people are worried .
but a buffer zone in europe between russia and the eu is risky . the aim of the constitution was to strengthen the cohesive power of brussels .
we 're in a difficult situation now , with dark clouds looming .
the next few years wo n't be easy , and that 's why i 'm fighting to win so that the chancellor and i can continue our responsible foreign policy as a self-confident policy of peace . and will you stay in politics even if you lose this general election ? yes , i 'm standing for a seat in parliament , and i will take that up whatever happens .

that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .
as for atheists , they 're out in the cold . " it does n't come into question , " berndoff said .

mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.08.2005 ecclesiastical economics : the pax bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bishopric of cologne has its own bank the church today may not possess the wealth it once did , but there is still a demand for financial services with a christian touch .
the pax bank in cologne has been meeting those needs for nearly 90 years . the 20th world youth day is well underway : 400,000 faithful have come to cologne to show their catholic devotion and that number is expected to double for benedict xvi 's mass on sunday . the massive event is drawing financial support from many sources , including the german dioceses , the city of cologne , the state of north rhine-westphalia , the federal government and the european union .
pilgrims are also required to pay a fee according to the economic strength of their home country .
the cologne-based pax bank is administering all the pontifical resources . the bank manages the finances of priests and other clergy members in the catholic church , as well as church institutions like the dioceses and the charity organization caritas .
in a modest edifice in cologne 's city center about 180 employees make sure that finances of the church and its leaders stay in the black .
they are also managing the finances of the world youth day . what does it mean to manage monies of this magnitude ?
dr. christoph berndoff , director of the pax bank , explained the nitty gritty of the bank 's mission to deutsche welle .
the pax bank , he said , is responsible for " organizing the transactions both nationally and internationally , as well as securing foreign currency exchange rates from nearby countries like england and switzerland as well as australia , america and canada . " bildunterschrift : the pope on the rhine . pass the collection plate , please ! for world youth day 2005 , the pax bank , founded in 1917 , designed a finance concept to ensure a smooth flow of funds during the mammoth event .
it also handles mundane tasks like collections during mass . at the last world youth day in toronto , the church was disappointed by a poorly managed collection system unable to deal with the overwhelming masses of faithful .
the pax bank in cologne is well prepared to collect from each and every pilgrim , said berndoff . " for the final mass , where we 're expecting over 800,000 worshipers , the collection will be organized with many , many points where people can make a donation , " he said .
" it wo n't happen again that , like in toronto , lots of eager donators were n't able to even reach a collection box . " a bank with a moral mission the pax bank , unlike most other banks , has something of a spiritual mission .
founded by the parish priest peter limberg as a savings-and-loan bank , it was from the beginning a financial institution espousing values such as self-reliance and autonomy .
its purpose has been , according to berndoff , to be a refuge for funds the clergy did not entrust leaving to " worldly " banks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims on the way to cologne .
" the special thing about the pax bank , " berndoff said , " is that we only deal with church business .
otherwise , we 're really just a normal bank .
we offer similar services , however ours are tailored to the needs of the clergy , especially their retirement funds , a major issue in germany and all over the world today . " aside from serving the clergy and managing world youth day finances , the pax bank , which deals with an investment volume worth three billon euros , must monitor its investments to ensure a high ethical standard .
this is the greatest mission of the bank , said berndoff . " if we do n't look at the ethical implications of our investments , who else will do it ? " asked berndoff .
" only a bank shaped by christian values will ensure that our investments meet a certain standard . " currently the bank has about 5,000 institutional customers , from small parishes to large catholic hospitals .
in addition there are about 24,000 private christian customers , including evangelical , non-catholic ones .

that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

dw-tv talked to foreign minister joschka fischer about his party 's chances . dw-tv : the opinion polls are speaking right now a harsh language for your green party and your coalition partner , the social democrats .
surveys show you are far behind and will probably not be in a position to form another government .
mr. fischer , where do you get your motivation to keep going with the campaign ? fischer : i do n't need to motivate myself because i 'm sure that these opinion polls will not reflect the eventual outcome on election night .
the germans will make their decisions in the last two or three weeks before the election .
it 's still an open race .
and thanks to the conservative leader and her party , the mood is changing .
i 've never drawn such big crowds in eastern germany , not even in the last election in 2002 when we won . i 'm really very surprised .
the mood is changing , and we will change it .
in 2002 , some people also predicted we would lose , and as you can see : i 'm an expert in surviving such predictions . bildunterschrift : fischer running a marathon does it make you angry that leading social democrats recently said that the red-green coalition was not a love match , but a mistimed alliance ? well the chancellor cleared that up , and i know his position .
we introduced reforms which should have been introduced by our predecessors in the 90s .
we pursued a self-confident policy of peace . under germany 's eu presidency , we made important contributions to european unity .
at the same time we faced great problems in the fight against unemployment , in achieving stronger economic growth , in reforming the pension and the health systems in the face of an ageing society . all these are great challenges and we have to make germany more competitive in an age of globalization .
but we 'll face up to these challenges as we have done in the past . so , we are not behind the times .
if anyone , it is rather frau merkel who is out of step .
she says she wants to put germany into forward gear to create more jobs , but in reality she has problems with the controls and has actually set the gears in reverse .
she wants to go back to nuclear energy .
even deutsche bank is now criticizing her for that - i 've never heard of anything like that happening .
her idea of the future already belongs to the past . bildunterschrift : the different faces of joschka fischer let 's stay with the opinion polls and your present situation for a moment .
in order to remain in power , red-green will need an additional partner .
who could that be ?
the new left party ?
or do you want to take the liberals on board ? no , you see , we 're fighting for our majority to be renewed .
it would never work with the liberals or the left party .

he is the manager of germany 's highest mountain , the zugspitze .
he tells dw-world what it 's like when the air is thin every workday . my workplace is at a height of 2,940 meters -lrb- 9,640 feet -rrb- .
i am the so-called summit manager for the " bayerische zugspitzbahn bergbahn " on the zugspitze , germany 's highest mountain -lrb- 2962 m -rrb- .
we operate the summit station , the lifts and the restaurants on the mountain .
everything ok ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred feldmeier at his workplace during the week , i live on the mountaintop in a company apartment .
depending on weather conditions , i wake up between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m.
there 's not a single month in the year where it does n't snow .
today , it was -11 celsius -lrb- 12 f -rrb- and there was snow on the ground , so the first thing i had to do was shovel the snow and throw sand .
after that , i did my normal work .
i set up the cabins on the cablecar and check that they are operational .
i also turn on the lights and the machines that read the tickets .
and then i check if the cablecar cable has to be de-iced .
ticket please ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august weather on the zugspitze can be fiercely cold after i 've eaten breakfast , around 7 a.m. , i do a test run on the cablecar .
i ride it from the summit to the base station to make sure everything is alright .
if nothing is wrong , then i ride back to the top , frequently with the first guests .
on the test run to the bottom , my wife rides along .
the night before , she takes the last gondola up .
she works as a cleaning lady on the zugspitze , so we see each other every day .
during the day , i am responsible for the visitors who are descending from the summit .
i stand at the gate on the first floor where the cars go back down and check the customers ' tickets .
aside from that , if there 's any small thing that needs doing , like changing a light bulb in the restroom , i do that too .
if it 's something bigger , then i call up a repairman .
back to the valley bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the post office even delivers and picks up mail from the summit station i usually take a lunch break between 1:30 and 2 p.m. , when i go to my apartment and cook something to eat .
after that it 's back to my workstation .
i take the next-to-last gondola down the mountain , officially that 's 4:45 pm but sometimes it is n't until 7:00 pm .
as a rule , i stay at the top until the last visitor has left .

that was not possible , but i greet you warmly , " he said . at one point , the pope cajoled them like a grandfather , gently urging them to " make the effort " to attend sunday mass . " dear friends , sometimes our initial impression is that having to include time for mass on a sunday is rather inconvenient .
but if you make the effort , you will realize that this is what gives a proper focus to your free time . " benedict urged the young catholics to keep god at the centre of their lives and underlined the importance of sunday mass and receiving holy communion . and the huge crowd seemed to appreciate the pope 's gently-delivered message , which sought to convey his own burning enthusiasm for the deeper mysteries of faith and the mass . " he seemed a lot younger and more vibrant than we had expected , " said george pierce , 17 , from the us state of pennsylvania .
" having heard his homily , i have a much better understanding of him and of his past .
i feel i have got to know him . " unusually for a pope , he even used the phrase " nuclear fission " to describe the spiritual effect of receiving holy communion , in which catholics believe bread and wine blessed by a priest is turned into the body and blood of christ in imitation of the last supper . massive crowd made personal contact impossible bildunterschrift : an overcast and breezy day in cologne broke into glorious sunshine as the pope began his homily .
calling on the pilgrims and visitors to world youth day to make wise use of the freedom god had given them , benedict said , " freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy , but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good . " " explosion " of religion in difficult times the pope added that in these modern times there was a " strange forgetfulness of god , " while at same time the sense of frustration and dissatisfaction had led to a " new explosion of religion . " bildunterschrift : " if it is pushed too far , religion becomes almost a consumer product , " he said .
" help people to discover the true star which points out the way to us : jesus christ . "
he announced at the ened of the mass that sydney , australia , would host the next world youth day in 2008 . benedict was due to return to rome on sunday evening at the end of what is being seen as a highly successful visit during which he met also met german jewish and muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a landmark visit to cologne 's synagogue on friday - only the second ever by a pope to a jewish place of worship - he condemned the " unimaginable crime " of the holocaust in an address to jewish leaders . and on saturday he urged muslim leaders to do more to combat the " cruel fanaticism " of terrorism that aimed to poison ties between christians and muslims .

the 80kg -lrb- 165lb -rrb- stone , called unspunnenstein , had already been stolen once in 1984 , by an underground group from the francophone region of jura .
the group has not made an outright claim this time , but issued a statement in support of the theft of the boulder .
it was to be the centrepiece of a festival due to take place next month .
the festival would have marked the stone 's bicentenary .
the event , which includes yodelling , alphorn playing , dancing and wrestling in lederhosen , revolves around and is named after the traditional stone-throwing competition .
it first took place in 1805 , at a gathering in unspunnen near interlaken to assert swiss national identity in the face of napoleon 's advances .
contestants lift the stone above their head and hurl it as far as they can , taking care not to step over a board .
territorial claims the theft early on sunday morning was witnessed by an employee in the lobby of the luxury hotel where it was being kept .
the four male thieves left behind a brick carrying the emblem of the neighbouring region of jura .
a separatist movement , known as belier , later issued a statement saying : " it is obvious the unspunnen stone is again in jurassian hands . "
the group would like a part of the jura hills which is still under the jurisdiction of the german-speaking bern canton to be integrated into the francophone jura canton .

the 80kg -lrb- 165lb -rrb- stone , called unspunnenstein , had already been stolen once in 1984 , by an underground group from the francophone region of jura .
the group has not made an outright claim this time , but issued a statement in support of the theft of the boulder .
it was to be the centrepiece of a festival due to take place next month .
the festival would have marked the stone 's bicentenary .
the event , which includes yodelling , alphorn playing , dancing and wrestling in lederhosen , revolves around and is named after the traditional stone-throwing competition .
it first took place in 1805 , at a gathering in unspunnen near interlaken to assert swiss national identity in the face of napoleon 's advances .
contestants lift the stone above their head and hurl it as far as they can , taking care not to step over a board .
territorial claims the theft early on sunday morning was witnessed by an employee in the lobby of the luxury hotel where it was being kept .
the four male thieves left behind a brick carrying the emblem of the neighbouring region of jura .
a separatist movement , known as belier , later issued a statement saying : " it is obvious the unspunnen stone is again in jurassian hands . "
the group would like a part of the jura hills which is still under the jurisdiction of the german-speaking bern canton to be integrated into the francophone jura canton .

the head of the greek catholic church , cardinal lubomyr husar , held a mass for some 1,000 believers to mark the move from the western city of lviv .
eastern-rite catholics follow orthodox ritual but bear allegiance to the pope .
the move could strain ties between the vatican and russia 's orthodox church , which has huge influence in ukraine .
the head of the russian orthodox church , patriarch alexy ii , had earlier described it as an " unfriendly " act .
protests bells rang as cardinal husar conducted the service outside a church being built for followers of ukraine 's greek catholic -lrb- or uniate -rrb- church .
" we do n't threaten anybody , we do n't want to threaten any orthodox church , " the cardinal said .
" the headquarters of any religious community should be in the capital , " he added .
the mass took place amid tight security , as several hundred orthodox protesters gathered near the site , denouncing the move .
" orthodox or death ! " they chanted , accusing the vatican of proselytising .
" you can kill us but you can not take our faith from us ! " demonstrators shouted .
the service was attended by officials from the ukrainian orthodox church -lrb- kiev patriarchate -rrb- , which is not recognised by the russian orthodox church .
' pan-ukrainian church ' the uniate church claims five to six million adherents - mainly in western ukraine - plus a further 1.5m among ethnic ukrainians living in russia .
the church was originally established in 1596 , when most of today 's ukraine was part of catholic poland .
the " union " was controversial from the start .
orthodox christians saw it as an annexation of part of their own church by rome .
with the expansion of the orthodox russian empire into ukraine , in the 17th and 18th centuries , the uniate church was banned .
it survived mainly in those parts of the old polish state which were incorporated into the catholic austrian empire in 1772 .
these areas , eventually annexed by the soviet union during world war ii , now form part of western ukraine .
in deciding to move its headquarters to kiev , the uniate church is indicating that it sees itself as a pan-ukrainian church - rather than a regional peculiarity , the bbc 's european affairs analyst jan repa says .
