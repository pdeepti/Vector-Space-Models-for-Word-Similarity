the disagreement began in earnest after a preliminary trial when the owner publicly doubted the nür n berger 's origin .
" containers of low quality pork are shipped to nuremberg from the netherlands , " he said at his first court appearance in april , adding that he was worried that the peppery nuremberg sausage would n't be good enough to satisfy his guests ' demanding palates . " neither the manufactures nor the ingredients for the sausage are from nuremberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurembergers love their sausages so much that they serve them on heart-shaped plates nuremberg 's residents obviously could n't sit back and let someone attack their sausage and its over 300 years of history .
since the production nür n berger s is protected by european union rules that limit nür n berger bratwurst to those made in the bavarian city with a prescribed recipe , the city took beck back to court .
the judge left beck the choice of either changing the establishment 's name or abiding by eu rules , meaning that he would use sausages from nuremberg and not those made out of just any bavarian pork .
things could get expensive for beck if he does n't follow the court 's rule : he 'd face a fine of 5,100 euros -lrb- $ 6,013 -rrb- for every nür n berger want-to-be he sells . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian sausage wars butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.11.2005 eu helping forest degradation , wwf says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu helping to ruin rainforests around the world ?
eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say . " while the aim of the regulation is to prevent illegal timber being imported into the eu , it is neither mandatory , nor does it prevent illegal timber being imported via third countries , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany power plants among eu 's dirtiest coal-fired power stations in greece , germany and spain top a new table of europe 's dirtiest electricity plants , according to wwf international study .

she had lunch in paris to talk about the eu and an afternoon snack in brussels , where she called for closer ties to the us . new german chancellor angela merkel called on wednesday for closer ties with the united states during a visit to nato headquarters in brussels as part of her first trip abroad as leader . " i believe the ties between the us and germany can be developed further , " she said after talks with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . relations between germany and the united states were badly soured by the staunch opposition of merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , to the us-led war in iraq . no changes in german-nato policy germany 's stance on iraq is a policy that merkel said would not change with her at the government 's reins , and that germany would not be involved in nato 's training of iraqi military officers inside iraq . " we made clear that we will continue not to take part in training inside iraq , but that we will continue to conduct training in neighboring countries , " she said .
" there will be continuity with the previous policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was off to brussels after meeting with chirac merkel added that the military alliance should be a key forum for improving transatlantic ties . " nato should be , i believe , the place where people turn first , where member states turn first , to discuss political issues of common concern , " she told reporters .

i believe that is very necessary ... only that way can we see to it that nato continues to be a political alliance . " earlier in the day merkel had traveled to paris , where she agreed with french president jacques chirac on the importance of keeping franco-german relations strong . chirac greeted merkel at the elysee palace with a discreet kiss on the hand before they posed for photographs , smiling broadly and exchanging a few words . stressing eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is the coalition 's new foreign minister merkel , accompanied by new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , had lunch with chirac .

the two countries are united in their wish for " a political and social europe " and " a truly strong franco-german axis " is necessary for the 25-member european union , chirac said . formally named chancellor tuesday , merkel 's choice of paris as her first foreign destination is seen as a fresh affirmation of the strength of the franco-german relationship at the heart of the european union .
thursday she will fly to london where prime minister tony blair will try to reach a compromise with merkel on the eu budget , which she has already refused to increase . protocol problems ? the conservative head of a rare left-right german coalition , merkel was formally named chancellor by the german parliament on tuesday .
as the country 's youngest and first female leader , her election ushers in a new era of delicate decisions when it comes to diplomatic protocol . take chirac 's gallant hand-kiss - a greeting he never gave merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder .
and then there 's the question of whether merkel would wear a head scarf if she were to visit certain middle eastern countries ; the rules of diplomacy dictate that the visiting party conform to the customs of the host . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will wear a head scarf on other state visits the main objective , of course , is to avoid embarrassment .
a recent visit by an iranian statesman in brussels could serve as a warning to merkel 's protocol officers : iranian parliament president gholam ali haddad-adel refused to shake the hand of belgium 's senate president anne-marie lizin , because she is a woman . should merkel receive a state visit from iran , her team would do well to iron out such potentially embarrassing details beforehand . at least one point of protocol has been clarified : the correct title for germany 's female head of government is madame chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a clear signal for germany angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.11.2005 eu helping forest degradation , wwf says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu helping to ruin rainforests around the world ?
eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say . " while the aim of the regulation is to prevent illegal timber being imported into the eu , it is neither mandatory , nor does it prevent illegal timber being imported via third countries , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany power plants among eu 's dirtiest coal-fired power stations in greece , germany and spain top a new table of europe 's dirtiest electricity plants , according to wwf international study .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 23.11.2005 opinion : a clear signal for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a chancellor , more than a woman angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .
she faces a tough time ahead , but as dw 's nina werkhäuser comments , merkel represents a double departure for germany . a giant poster baring the words " a new beginning " decorates the christian democrat union party headquarters in berlin .
on it is angela merkel , germany 's first ever female leader , looking like she means business . if there is one thing germany really needs right now it is a fresh start .
the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .
by the time the national ballot came knocking , the electorate had had its fill of the red-green alliance , but could n't muster sufficient trust in a conservative-liberal union .
thus the grand coalition . germa n y catchi n g up the fact that it is headed by a woman makes it a double departure .
firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .
parliamentary president , norbert lammert described merkel 's election as " a clear signal for many women , and doubtless some men too . "
but the main thing is that it becomes a clear signal for germany . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's first female leader wishes merkel well over 10 years ago , turkish economist tansu ciller became her country 's first female prime minister .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

" they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .
parliamentary president , norbert lammert described merkel 's election as " a clear signal for many women , and doubtless some men too . "
but the main thing is that it becomes a clear signal for germany . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's first female leader wishes merkel well over 10 years ago , turkish economist tansu ciller became her country 's first female prime minister .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

" where was her husband ? " blared the front-page headline in germany 's top tabloid , bild , and every other news organization in the country made mention of it as well : while new chancellor angela merkel 's parents and brother were on the podium during her swearing-in ceremony , her spouse , joachim sauer , was visibly absent . " he watched it on tv , " merkel told public broadcaster zdf .
" sometimes people have different tastes on days like this one .
but he was very happy . " according to reports , sauer - a professor at berlin 's humboldt university and considered one of the top 30 researchers working in the field of physical chemistry of molecules - was busy with important appointments that day .
he opted to watch the inauguration on television , and congratulated his wife by telephone .
the couple celebrated in a small circle of friends and family in the evening , the news reports said . ' pha n tom of the opera ' the couple has known each other for 20 years , having met during their studies in then east germany .
they were married in 1998 ; it is a second marriage for them both . sauer is repeatedly referred to in the press as " extremely publicity shy , " and unlike ex-chancellor gerhard schröder 's wife doris , he was virtually invisible during merkel 's election campaign .
in fact , the couple is rarely seen together in public , aside from an annual social appearance at the opera festival in bayreuth - earning sauer the nickname " phantom of the opera " in the german press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sauer did vote together on sept .
18 to date , 56-year-old sauer has rigorously refused to assume the mantle of political spouse . " i will not talk to journalists about anything that does not concern my work as a scientist or lecturer , " he told newspaper reporters last summer . but like it or not , merkel 's election to the country 's highest office means her husband will , to some degree , represent germany right beside her .
and she conceded during the election that , should she become chancellor , he would have to appear more frequently at her side . no de n is thatcher the question is , what role will - or should - her husband take ?
sauer stayed in berlin during her first official foreign visits , to paris and brussels .
while protocol says he has the right to determine the shape of his visits to other countries when he accompanies his wife , it seems clear he wo n't be taking part in the usual " ladies ' program . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even long past retirement , denis is at margaret thatcher 's side he almost certainly will not emerge as germany 's answer to england 's denis thatcher , who once carried his wife 's handbag , and was often pictured standing at prime minister margaret thatcher 's side during public appearances and state visits . ' a great guy ' merkel appears to have no problem with sauer 's decision to avoid the limelight . " my husband would like to keep his career , " was how merkel , 51 , summed up their future as first couple in when pressed during the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the power couple were often seen together , looking happy this is a stark contrast with her predecessor gerhard schröder , whose wife doris was a frequent and vocal presence , both during the campaign and in office .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

the disagreement began in earnest after a preliminary trial when the owner publicly doubted the nür n berger 's origin .
" containers of low quality pork are shipped to nuremberg from the netherlands , " he said at his first court appearance in april , adding that he was worried that the peppery nuremberg sausage would n't be good enough to satisfy his guests ' demanding palates . " neither the manufactures nor the ingredients for the sausage are from nuremberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurembergers love their sausages so much that they serve them on heart-shaped plates nuremberg 's residents obviously could n't sit back and let someone attack their sausage and its over 300 years of history .
since the production nür n berger s is protected by european union rules that limit nür n berger bratwurst to those made in the bavarian city with a prescribed recipe , the city took beck back to court .
the judge left beck the choice of either changing the establishment 's name or abiding by eu rules , meaning that he would use sausages from nuremberg and not those made out of just any bavarian pork .
things could get expensive for beck if he does n't follow the court 's rule : he 'd face a fine of 5,100 euros -lrb- $ 6,013 -rrb- for every nür n berger want-to-be he sells . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian sausage wars butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality .

eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say . " while the aim of the regulation is to prevent illegal timber being imported into the eu , it is neither mandatory , nor does it prevent illegal timber being imported via third countries , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany power plants among eu 's dirtiest coal-fired power stations in greece , germany and spain top a new table of europe 's dirtiest electricity plants , according to wwf international study .

the judge left beck the choice of either changing the establishment 's name or abiding by eu rules , meaning that he would use sausages from nuremberg and not those made out of just any bavarian pork .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.11.2005 eu helping forest degradation , wwf says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu helping to ruin rainforests around the world ?
eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say . " while the aim of the regulation is to prevent illegal timber being imported into the eu , it is neither mandatory , nor does it prevent illegal timber being imported via third countries , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany power plants among eu 's dirtiest coal-fired power stations in greece , germany and spain top a new table of europe 's dirtiest electricity plants , according to wwf international study .

" the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .

the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say .

eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say . " while the aim of the regulation is to prevent illegal timber being imported into the eu , it is neither mandatory , nor does it prevent illegal timber being imported via third countries , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany power plants among eu 's dirtiest coal-fired power stations in greece , germany and spain top a new table of europe 's dirtiest electricity plants , according to wwf international study .

the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .

firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .

" the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .

she had lunch in paris to talk about the eu and an afternoon snack in brussels , where she called for closer ties to the us . new german chancellor angela merkel called on wednesday for closer ties with the united states during a visit to nato headquarters in brussels as part of her first trip abroad as leader . " i believe the ties between the us and germany can be developed further , " she said after talks with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . relations between germany and the united states were badly soured by the staunch opposition of merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , to the us-led war in iraq . no changes in german-nato policy germany 's stance on iraq is a policy that merkel said would not change with her at the government 's reins , and that germany would not be involved in nato 's training of iraqi military officers inside iraq . " we made clear that we will continue not to take part in training inside iraq , but that we will continue to conduct training in neighboring countries , " she said .
" there will be continuity with the previous policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was off to brussels after meeting with chirac merkel added that the military alliance should be a key forum for improving transatlantic ties . " nato should be , i believe , the place where people turn first , where member states turn first , to discuss political issues of common concern , " she told reporters .
" first and foremost we should try to pursue the approach that nato is the place for such discussions .
i believe that is very necessary ... only that way can we see to it that nato continues to be a political alliance . " earlier in the day merkel had traveled to paris , where she agreed with french president jacques chirac on the importance of keeping franco-german relations strong . chirac greeted merkel at the elysee palace with a discreet kiss on the hand before they posed for photographs , smiling broadly and exchanging a few words . stressing eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is the coalition 's new foreign minister merkel , accompanied by new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , had lunch with chirac .
in a follow-up press conference , chirac said a " truly strong " franco-german partnership was essential for europe .
the two countries are united in their wish for " a political and social europe " and " a truly strong franco-german axis " is necessary for the 25-member european union , chirac said . formally named chancellor tuesday , merkel 's choice of paris as her first foreign destination is seen as a fresh affirmation of the strength of the franco-german relationship at the heart of the european union .
thursday she will fly to london where prime minister tony blair will try to reach a compromise with merkel on the eu budget , which she has already refused to increase . protocol problems ? the conservative head of a rare left-right german coalition , merkel was formally named chancellor by the german parliament on tuesday .
as the country 's youngest and first female leader , her election ushers in a new era of delicate decisions when it comes to diplomatic protocol . take chirac 's gallant hand-kiss - a greeting he never gave merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder .
and then there 's the question of whether merkel would wear a head scarf if she were to visit certain middle eastern countries ; the rules of diplomacy dictate that the visiting party conform to the customs of the host . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will wear a head scarf on other state visits the main objective , of course , is to avoid embarrassment .
a recent visit by an iranian statesman in brussels could serve as a warning to merkel 's protocol officers : iranian parliament president gholam ali haddad-adel refused to shake the hand of belgium 's senate president anne-marie lizin , because she is a woman . should merkel receive a state visit from iran , her team would do well to iron out such potentially embarrassing details beforehand . at least one point of protocol has been clarified : the correct title for germany 's female head of government is madame chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a clear signal for germany angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.11.2005 eu helping forest degradation , wwf says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu helping to ruin rainforests around the world ?
eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say . " while the aim of the regulation is to prevent illegal timber being imported into the eu , it is neither mandatory , nor does it prevent illegal timber being imported via third countries , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany power plants among eu 's dirtiest coal-fired power stations in greece , germany and spain top a new table of europe 's dirtiest electricity plants , according to wwf international study .

she faces a tough time ahead , but as dw 's nina werkhäuser comments , merkel represents a double departure for germany . a giant poster baring the words " a new beginning " decorates the christian democrat union party headquarters in berlin .
on it is angela merkel , germany 's first ever female leader , looking like she means business . if there is one thing germany really needs right now it is a fresh start .
the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .
by the time the national ballot came knocking , the electorate had had its fill of the red-green alliance , but could n't muster sufficient trust in a conservative-liberal union .
thus the grand coalition . germa n y catchi n g up the fact that it is headed by a woman makes it a double departure .
firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .

she faces a tough time ahead , but as dw 's nina werkhäuser comments , merkel represents a double departure for germany . a giant poster baring the words " a new beginning " decorates the christian democrat union party headquarters in berlin .
on it is angela merkel , germany 's first ever female leader , looking like she means business . if there is one thing germany really needs right now it is a fresh start .
the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .

thus the grand coalition . germa n y catchi n g up the fact that it is headed by a woman makes it a double departure .
firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 23.11.2005 opinion : a clear signal for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a chancellor , more than a woman angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .
she faces a tough time ahead , but as dw 's nina werkhäuser comments , merkel represents a double departure for germany . a giant poster baring the words " a new beginning " decorates the christian democrat union party headquarters in berlin .
on it is angela merkel , germany 's first ever female leader , looking like she means business . if there is one thing germany really needs right now it is a fresh start .
the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .
by the time the national ballot came knocking , the electorate had had its fill of the red-green alliance , but could n't muster sufficient trust in a conservative-liberal union .
thus the grand coalition . germa n y catchi n g up the fact that it is headed by a woman makes it a double departure .
firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .
parliamentary president , norbert lammert described merkel 's election as " a clear signal for many women , and doubtless some men too . "
but the main thing is that it becomes a clear signal for germany . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's first female leader wishes merkel well over 10 years ago , turkish economist tansu ciller became her country 's first female prime minister .

advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.11.2005 eu helping forest degradation , wwf says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu helping to ruin rainforests around the world ?
eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say . " while the aim of the regulation is to prevent illegal timber being imported into the eu , it is neither mandatory , nor does it prevent illegal timber being imported via third countries , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany power plants among eu 's dirtiest coal-fired power stations in greece , germany and spain top a new table of europe 's dirtiest electricity plants , according to wwf international study .

2 for a visit likely to be dominated by controversy over a planned centre of remembrance in berlin for germans expelled from poland in revenge for the nazi invasion of the country . she has pledged her support for the project , but it is opposed by the incoming polish leadership . as far as germany 's increasingly strong relations with russia are concerned , it will be fascinating to see how they weather the departure of schröder , who enjoyed a close personal friendship with president vladimir putin . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say merkel will bring change in style , not policy for us germany finally has a coalition deal , paving the way for angela merkel to become chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 23.11.2005 opinion : a clear signal for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a chancellor , more than a woman angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .
she faces a tough time ahead , but as dw 's nina werkhäuser comments , merkel represents a double departure for germany . a giant poster baring the words " a new beginning " decorates the christian democrat union party headquarters in berlin .
on it is angela merkel , germany 's first ever female leader , looking like she means business . if there is one thing germany really needs right now it is a fresh start .
the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .
by the time the national ballot came knocking , the electorate had had its fill of the red-green alliance , but could n't muster sufficient trust in a conservative-liberal union .
thus the grand coalition . germa n y catchi n g up the fact that it is headed by a woman makes it a double departure .
firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .
parliamentary president , norbert lammert described merkel 's election as " a clear signal for many women , and doubtless some men too . "
but the main thing is that it becomes a clear signal for germany . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's first female leader wishes merkel well over 10 years ago , turkish economist tansu ciller became her country 's first female prime minister .
as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences .
-lrb- nov .
22 , 2005 -rrb- well-wishers congratulate merkel heads of state and business representatives alike sent congratulations to germany 's newly-inaugurated chancellor angela merkel .
-lrb- nov.22 , 2005 -rrb- angie 's new web site to get feminine makeover with angela merkel about to be sworn in , the web site for the german chancellor is out of date , as the address only implies a male " kanzler . "
but thanks to a forward-thinking young man , she 's got nothing to worry about .

she had lunch in paris to talk about the eu and an afternoon snack in brussels , where she called for closer ties to the us . new german chancellor angela merkel called on wednesday for closer ties with the united states during a visit to nato headquarters in brussels as part of her first trip abroad as leader . " i believe the ties between the us and germany can be developed further , " she said after talks with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . relations between germany and the united states were badly soured by the staunch opposition of merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , to the us-led war in iraq . no changes in german-nato policy germany 's stance on iraq is a policy that merkel said would not change with her at the government 's reins , and that germany would not be involved in nato 's training of iraqi military officers inside iraq . " we made clear that we will continue not to take part in training inside iraq , but that we will continue to conduct training in neighboring countries , " she said .
" there will be continuity with the previous policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was off to brussels after meeting with chirac merkel added that the military alliance should be a key forum for improving transatlantic ties . " nato should be , i believe , the place where people turn first , where member states turn first , to discuss political issues of common concern , " she told reporters .
" first and foremost we should try to pursue the approach that nato is the place for such discussions .
i believe that is very necessary ... only that way can we see to it that nato continues to be a political alliance . " earlier in the day merkel had traveled to paris , where she agreed with french president jacques chirac on the importance of keeping franco-german relations strong . chirac greeted merkel at the elysee palace with a discreet kiss on the hand before they posed for photographs , smiling broadly and exchanging a few words . stressing eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is the coalition 's new foreign minister merkel , accompanied by new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , had lunch with chirac .
in a follow-up press conference , chirac said a " truly strong " franco-german partnership was essential for europe .
the two countries are united in their wish for " a political and social europe " and " a truly strong franco-german axis " is necessary for the 25-member european union , chirac said . formally named chancellor tuesday , merkel 's choice of paris as her first foreign destination is seen as a fresh affirmation of the strength of the franco-german relationship at the heart of the european union .
thursday she will fly to london where prime minister tony blair will try to reach a compromise with merkel on the eu budget , which she has already refused to increase . protocol problems ? the conservative head of a rare left-right german coalition , merkel was formally named chancellor by the german parliament on tuesday .
as the country 's youngest and first female leader , her election ushers in a new era of delicate decisions when it comes to diplomatic protocol . take chirac 's gallant hand-kiss - a greeting he never gave merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder .
and then there 's the question of whether merkel would wear a head scarf if she were to visit certain middle eastern countries ; the rules of diplomacy dictate that the visiting party conform to the customs of the host . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will wear a head scarf on other state visits the main objective , of course , is to avoid embarrassment .
a recent visit by an iranian statesman in brussels could serve as a warning to merkel 's protocol officers : iranian parliament president gholam ali haddad-adel refused to shake the hand of belgium 's senate president anne-marie lizin , because she is a woman . should merkel receive a state visit from iran , her team would do well to iron out such potentially embarrassing details beforehand . at least one point of protocol has been clarified : the correct title for germany 's female head of government is madame chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a clear signal for germany angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .

and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .

the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .

she faces a tough time ahead , but as dw 's nina werkhäuser comments , merkel represents a double departure for germany . a giant poster baring the words " a new beginning " decorates the christian democrat union party headquarters in berlin .
on it is angela merkel , germany 's first ever female leader , looking like she means business . if there is one thing germany really needs right now it is a fresh start .
the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .
by the time the national ballot came knocking , the electorate had had its fill of the red-green alliance , but could n't muster sufficient trust in a conservative-liberal union .
thus the grand coalition . germa n y catchi n g up the fact that it is headed by a woman makes it a double departure .
firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .
parliamentary president , norbert lammert described merkel 's election as " a clear signal for many women , and doubtless some men too . "
but the main thing is that it becomes a clear signal for germany . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's first female leader wishes merkel well over 10 years ago , turkish economist tansu ciller became her country 's first female prime minister .
as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

" private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say . " while the aim of the regulation is to prevent illegal timber being imported into the eu , it is neither mandatory , nor does it prevent illegal timber being imported via third countries , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany power plants among eu 's dirtiest coal-fired power stations in greece , germany and spain top a new table of europe 's dirtiest electricity plants , according to wwf international study .

she had lunch in paris to talk about the eu and an afternoon snack in brussels , where she called for closer ties to the us . new german chancellor angela merkel called on wednesday for closer ties with the united states during a visit to nato headquarters in brussels as part of her first trip abroad as leader . " i believe the ties between the us and germany can be developed further , " she said after talks with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . relations between germany and the united states were badly soured by the staunch opposition of merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , to the us-led war in iraq . no changes in german-nato policy germany 's stance on iraq is a policy that merkel said would not change with her at the government 's reins , and that germany would not be involved in nato 's training of iraqi military officers inside iraq . " we made clear that we will continue not to take part in training inside iraq , but that we will continue to conduct training in neighboring countries , " she said .
" there will be continuity with the previous policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was off to brussels after meeting with chirac merkel added that the military alliance should be a key forum for improving transatlantic ties . " nato should be , i believe , the place where people turn first , where member states turn first , to discuss political issues of common concern , " she told reporters .
" first and foremost we should try to pursue the approach that nato is the place for such discussions .
i believe that is very necessary ... only that way can we see to it that nato continues to be a political alliance . " earlier in the day merkel had traveled to paris , where she agreed with french president jacques chirac on the importance of keeping franco-german relations strong . chirac greeted merkel at the elysee palace with a discreet kiss on the hand before they posed for photographs , smiling broadly and exchanging a few words . stressing eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is the coalition 's new foreign minister merkel , accompanied by new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , had lunch with chirac .
in a follow-up press conference , chirac said a " truly strong " franco-german partnership was essential for europe .
the two countries are united in their wish for " a political and social europe " and " a truly strong franco-german axis " is necessary for the 25-member european union , chirac said . formally named chancellor tuesday , merkel 's choice of paris as her first foreign destination is seen as a fresh affirmation of the strength of the franco-german relationship at the heart of the european union .
thursday she will fly to london where prime minister tony blair will try to reach a compromise with merkel on the eu budget , which she has already refused to increase . protocol problems ? the conservative head of a rare left-right german coalition , merkel was formally named chancellor by the german parliament on tuesday .
as the country 's youngest and first female leader , her election ushers in a new era of delicate decisions when it comes to diplomatic protocol . take chirac 's gallant hand-kiss - a greeting he never gave merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder .
and then there 's the question of whether merkel would wear a head scarf if she were to visit certain middle eastern countries ; the rules of diplomacy dictate that the visiting party conform to the customs of the host . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will wear a head scarf on other state visits the main objective , of course , is to avoid embarrassment .
a recent visit by an iranian statesman in brussels could serve as a warning to merkel 's protocol officers : iranian parliament president gholam ali haddad-adel refused to shake the hand of belgium 's senate president anne-marie lizin , because she is a woman . should merkel receive a state visit from iran , her team would do well to iron out such potentially embarrassing details beforehand . at least one point of protocol has been clarified : the correct title for germany 's female head of government is madame chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a clear signal for germany angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .

eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .

" those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under .

but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 23.11.2005 opinion : a clear signal for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a chancellor , more than a woman angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .
she faces a tough time ahead , but as dw 's nina werkhäuser comments , merkel represents a double departure for germany . a giant poster baring the words " a new beginning " decorates the christian democrat union party headquarters in berlin .
on it is angela merkel , germany 's first ever female leader , looking like she means business . if there is one thing germany really needs right now it is a fresh start .
the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .
by the time the national ballot came knocking , the electorate had had its fill of the red-green alliance , but could n't muster sufficient trust in a conservative-liberal union .
thus the grand coalition . germa n y catchi n g up the fact that it is headed by a woman makes it a double departure .
firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .
parliamentary president , norbert lammert described merkel 's election as " a clear signal for many women , and doubtless some men too . "
but the main thing is that it becomes a clear signal for germany . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's first female leader wishes merkel well over 10 years ago , turkish economist tansu ciller became her country 's first female prime minister .
as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences .

" private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

the disagreement began in earnest after a preliminary trial when the owner publicly doubted the nür n berger 's origin .
" containers of low quality pork are shipped to nuremberg from the netherlands , " he said at his first court appearance in april , adding that he was worried that the peppery nuremberg sausage would n't be good enough to satisfy his guests ' demanding palates . " neither the manufactures nor the ingredients for the sausage are from nuremberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurembergers love their sausages so much that they serve them on heart-shaped plates nuremberg 's residents obviously could n't sit back and let someone attack their sausage and its over 300 years of history .
since the production nür n berger s is protected by european union rules that limit nür n berger bratwurst to those made in the bavarian city with a prescribed recipe , the city took beck back to court .
the judge left beck the choice of either changing the establishment 's name or abiding by eu rules , meaning that he would use sausages from nuremberg and not those made out of just any bavarian pork .
things could get expensive for beck if he does n't follow the court 's rule : he 'd face a fine of 5,100 euros -lrb- $ 6,013 -rrb- for every nür n berger want-to-be he sells . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian sausage wars butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality .

firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .

social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .

" the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year .

the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .

eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say . " while the aim of the regulation is to prevent illegal timber being imported into the eu , it is neither mandatory , nor does it prevent illegal timber being imported via third countries , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany power plants among eu 's dirtiest coal-fired power stations in greece , germany and spain top a new table of europe 's dirtiest electricity plants , according to wwf international study .

she had lunch in paris to talk about the eu and an afternoon snack in brussels , where she called for closer ties to the us . new german chancellor angela merkel called on wednesday for closer ties with the united states during a visit to nato headquarters in brussels as part of her first trip abroad as leader . " i believe the ties between the us and germany can be developed further , " she said after talks with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . relations between germany and the united states were badly soured by the staunch opposition of merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , to the us-led war in iraq . no changes in german-nato policy germany 's stance on iraq is a policy that merkel said would not change with her at the government 's reins , and that germany would not be involved in nato 's training of iraqi military officers inside iraq . " we made clear that we will continue not to take part in training inside iraq , but that we will continue to conduct training in neighboring countries , " she said .
" there will be continuity with the previous policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was off to brussels after meeting with chirac merkel added that the military alliance should be a key forum for improving transatlantic ties . " nato should be , i believe , the place where people turn first , where member states turn first , to discuss political issues of common concern , " she told reporters .
" first and foremost we should try to pursue the approach that nato is the place for such discussions .
i believe that is very necessary ... only that way can we see to it that nato continues to be a political alliance . " earlier in the day merkel had traveled to paris , where she agreed with french president jacques chirac on the importance of keeping franco-german relations strong . chirac greeted merkel at the elysee palace with a discreet kiss on the hand before they posed for photographs , smiling broadly and exchanging a few words . stressing eu ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is the coalition 's new foreign minister merkel , accompanied by new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , had lunch with chirac .
in a follow-up press conference , chirac said a " truly strong " franco-german partnership was essential for europe .
the two countries are united in their wish for " a political and social europe " and " a truly strong franco-german axis " is necessary for the 25-member european union , chirac said . formally named chancellor tuesday , merkel 's choice of paris as her first foreign destination is seen as a fresh affirmation of the strength of the franco-german relationship at the heart of the european union .
thursday she will fly to london where prime minister tony blair will try to reach a compromise with merkel on the eu budget , which she has already refused to increase . protocol problems ? the conservative head of a rare left-right german coalition , merkel was formally named chancellor by the german parliament on tuesday .
as the country 's youngest and first female leader , her election ushers in a new era of delicate decisions when it comes to diplomatic protocol . take chirac 's gallant hand-kiss - a greeting he never gave merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder .
and then there 's the question of whether merkel would wear a head scarf if she were to visit certain middle eastern countries ; the rules of diplomacy dictate that the visiting party conform to the customs of the host . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will wear a head scarf on other state visits the main objective , of course , is to avoid embarrassment .
a recent visit by an iranian statesman in brussels could serve as a warning to merkel 's protocol officers : iranian parliament president gholam ali haddad-adel refused to shake the hand of belgium 's senate president anne-marie lizin , because she is a woman . should merkel receive a state visit from iran , her team would do well to iron out such potentially embarrassing details beforehand . at least one point of protocol has been clarified : the correct title for germany 's female head of government is madame chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a clear signal for germany angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 23.11.2005 opinion : a clear signal for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a chancellor , more than a woman angela merkel is germany 's new chancellor and the first woman to get the job .
she faces a tough time ahead , but as dw 's nina werkhäuser comments , merkel represents a double departure for germany . a giant poster baring the words " a new beginning " decorates the christian democrat union party headquarters in berlin .
on it is angela merkel , germany 's first ever female leader , looking like she means business . if there is one thing germany really needs right now it is a fresh start .
the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .
by the time the national ballot came knocking , the electorate had had its fill of the red-green alliance , but could n't muster sufficient trust in a conservative-liberal union .
thus the grand coalition . germa n y catchi n g up the fact that it is headed by a woman makes it a double departure .
firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .
parliamentary president , norbert lammert described merkel 's election as " a clear signal for many women , and doubtless some men too . "
but the main thing is that it becomes a clear signal for germany . nina werkhäuser -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's first female leader wishes merkel well over 10 years ago , turkish economist tansu ciller became her country 's first female prime minister .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de focus on pensions , health in german coalition talks negotiations aimed at forming a grand coalition government in germany have continued with a focus on ways to remedy chronic cash shortages in the country 's health and pensions systems .

" private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .

she faces a tough time ahead , but as dw 's nina werkhäuser comments , merkel represents a double departure for germany . a giant poster baring the words " a new beginning " decorates the christian democrat union party headquarters in berlin .
on it is angela merkel , germany 's first ever female leader , looking like she means business . if there is one thing germany really needs right now it is a fresh start .
the political situation has been stagnant for over a year , the hartz iv program of reformed unemployment benefit regulations came , schröder began to fade out and the nation drifted along in no particular direction .
by the time the national ballot came knocking , the electorate had had its fill of the red-green alliance , but could n't muster sufficient trust in a conservative-liberal union .
thus the grand coalition . germa n y catchi n g up the fact that it is headed by a woman makes it a double departure .
firstly , with a comfortable majority in both the bundestag and bundesrat , the first and second houses of parliament , the new government has the chance to continue down the road of modernizing the nation 's social policies and overhauling the state coffers .
and secondly , germany has finally done what has been acceptable in other countries for a long time , in recognizing that a woman can hold the reins of power , and fail or succeed just as a man can . on her path to the chancellery , angela merkel has had to clear countless hurdles , find her way out of tailspins and fight off relentless attacks .
she deserves respect and recognition for the fact , that despite such ups and downs , she has never given up .
not least because many of the negative comments aimed at merkel were as much about her implied incompetence as a woman as her political intentions . no special treatme n t there are some powerful figures among her own conservatives who made a habit out of waiting for her to make her next slip in order to creep past her and make their own bid for the chancellor 's chair .
social democrat gerhard schröder initially found the idea of passing his office on to a woman unimaginable , but has now voted for the 51-year-old woman from the former east germany . one of merkel 's strengths is that she knows about political power games .
just as she is unwilling to grant anybody special treatment , she expects none for herself .
she knows how to listen , how to reach compromises and she wants to affect change .
the question now is whether she and her ministers can get it together to generate a genuine shift in the country . the fact that 51 conservative and social democratic parliamentarians did not grant merkel their vote is no reason for pessimism , but it does show that this grand marriage of convenience is an experiment , and goes hand-in-hand with a whole gamut of risks and opportunities .

eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america .

cries have gotten louder that the system of public and private insurance providers has created two classes of health care . when peter stegman calls to set up a doctor 's appointment , he usually gets what he wants .
the 37-year-old berlin resident who works in the mobile phone industry is insured privately , and if he wants an appointment on the next day , he almost always gets it . " you just get treated better when you have private insurance than if you have the public kind , " he said .
" the service is better and you have more choice . " before coming to germany from finland two years ago , he investigated the country 's insurance system and was told that if he could afford it , private insurance was the best option , since people on the public plans get lower priority with many doctors . " they have problems getting appointments quickly ; it takes a lot more time , " he said . second-class service anecdotal evidence abounds about difference in service between those insured under private health care plans in germany and those with the state system .
the newspaper bild conducted a test of 100 doctor 's offices around germany , calling each to set up appointments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say doctors are happier when their patients are privately insured in each case , one caller would claim to have private insurance , another to be insured under the public system .
in the majority of cases , the privately insured individual got appointments much sooner than did publicly insured pretend patients , if they got appointments at all . " private patients are preferred , publicly insured patients are brazenly turned away , just gotten rid of , " heinz windisch , president of vkvd , an interest group for both privately and publicly insured individuals , told the newspaper . all this has led to accusations that patients in the public system are second-class citizens , having to wait months for non-emergency doctor 's appointments or procedures and paying ever more out of their own pockets as the list of covered treatments and medicines shrinks , all the while watching as their monthly health insurance contributions continue to rise . public vs. private people who earn less than 46,800 euros -lrb- $ 54,850 -rrb- per year are obligated to enroll in one of germany 's public health plans .
their contributions are determined by their income and range from 12.7 to 15.5 percent , half of which their employer pays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publicly insured patients have to shell out for dentures in addition , patients must pay a 10 euro quarterly office fee , five to 10 euros for medicines , pay for shared rooms in hospitals and generally cover 50 percent of the cost of dental prostheses . private patients , on the other hand , generally have much more choice regarding doctors , have long lists of services covered , are not required to pay a quarterly office fee , and can receive medicines or eyeglasses without additional charges . " those who pay more in germany get better service , " said kai a. konrad , a professor specializing in health system economics at the institute of public finance and social policy at berlin 's free university .
" they are like two different products . " but that dual system does not sit well with many , including germany 's social democratic health minister , ulla schmidt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt " those who are publicly insured should not have to get the feeling that they are second-class citizens , " she said . she wants to do away with the system that allows doctors to charge different fees for the same services depending on whether a patient is publicly or privately insured .
for example , a doctor conducting an ultra-sound test on a public patient can charge 17 euros .
however , that same test conducted on a private patient can bring the doctor 58.97 euros .
therefore , from a purely economic standpoint , it is in the physician 's interest to attract as many private patients as possible , and keep the number of public patients lower . " many doctor 's offices in germany are dependent on these higher fees , " said roland stahl , a spokesman for the national association of statutory health insurance physicians .
" if they disappear , then about one-third of the medical practices in germany would go under . " he says the quality of the health care itself is generally not dependent on what kind of insurance one has , although he admits the speed at which one gets to the see the doctor often is . which reform ? reforming germany 's health care system is considered crucial by most politicians on both the left and the right .
but what that reform should look like is a matter of much debate . in the negotiations that led to the coalition government under angela merkel the topic was so divisive it was left off the table for now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generally free for the privately insured , getting more expensive for others health minister schmidt 's plan for merging the fee schedules for both public and private patients has led to some accusations that she wants to do away with private insurance companies all together . indeed , on the left , the idea of a " citizen 's insurance " - an obligatory public plan for everybody - has found some support , and her plan might move in that direction , although no one is seriously advocating abolishing private insurance yet . angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for a single , flat rate - or " premium " - for all members of the country 's public plans , which are now calculated according to income level . bakery example health expert konrad tries to illustrate the complicated issue of the two plans with a metaphor of an imaginary bakery .
if this bakery were run by the social democrats , who advocate wealth redistribution , the cost of rolls would depend on the income level of the buyer .
low-income people would pay 20 cents per roll , those with higher incomes would pay 40 cents . " the problem people have with this system is that people with lower incomes buy too many rolls and people with higher incomes buy too few , " he said , explaining that the rolls in this illustration represent medical services .
after a while , he says , the economic sustainability of the bakery -lrb- medical plan -rrb- comes into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bread is the staff of life , they say .
under the cdu 's " premium " plan , all the rolls -lrb- medical services -rrb- would cost the same , no matter what the buyer 's income is .
advocates here say that would encourage people to only buy however many rolls they actually needed to sate their hunger - not too many , not too few .
they also say such a plan would encourage competition between the plans and could drive down costs . but this plan , which would do away with the redistribution aspect all together , is not completely feasible at this point , konrad says . " we do n't think either plan is sustainable , " said stahl of the health insurance physicians ' group .
" we 'll need a mix of these two when reform finally does come around , probably not before 2008 .

" i believe the ties between the us and germany can be developed further , " she said after talks with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . relations between germany and the united states were badly soured by the staunch opposition of merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , to the us-led war in iraq . no changes in german-nato policy germany 's stance on iraq is a policy that merkel said would not change with her at the government 's reins , and that germany would not be involved in nato 's training of iraqi military officers inside iraq . " we made clear that we will continue not to take part in training inside iraq , but that we will continue to conduct training in neighboring countries , " she said .

eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , the conservation watchdog group , the world wildlife fund said this week . calling britain " the biggest importer of illegal timber in europe , " the swiss-based world wildlife fund blasted eu countries thursday for trading in illegal timber that is leading to the loss of forests in africa , asia and latin america . " the eu is probably importing a substantial and increasing quantity of illegal timber from all regions , " the wwf said in the report released shortly before a eu ministerial meeting on the issue tuesday in brussels .
" as a result , the eu is responsible for around € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- of the global € 10 – 15 billion in lost revenue due to illegal logging each year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists blocking illegal timber the report argues the eu imports about 20 million cubic meters of illegal timber a year particularly from forests that lie in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa or the baltic states . the report particularly singled out britain , saying that it was responsible for the loss of 600,000 hectares of forest - more than twice the size of luxembourg - each year in asia , africa and latin america .
the report added that about 28 percent of timber - or 2.2 million cubic meters - that arrives in the uk is from trees should not be cut down . the uk is followed by finland , germany , france , italy and the netherlands as the biggest eu importers .
on the other hand , finland and sweden are the countries with the highest amount of paper and timber made from illegally logged wood - with 5.1 million and 2.6 million cubic meters respectively . depriving the poor of income wwf experts studied trade between eu nations and countries in the amazon basin , the congo basin , east africa , indonesia and russia and also the baltic states which are now eu members . the illegal logging that feeds the trade was depriving local communities of their livelihoods while fueling profits to international companies involved in the trade , the report added .
it particularly threatens forests in africa and indonesia over the next 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf report : eu must tighten laws the practice of illegal logging involves forest poachers cutting down trees , in violation of national conservation measures and outside the control of governments , the report detailed .
the wood is smuggled out to another country before going on the world market . the wwf is recommending that the eu introduce a ban on the imports of illegal timber instead of current policy favoring voluntary agreements between its 25 members and producer countries which " falls far short of the measures needed , " wwf officials say .

the disagreement began in earnest after a preliminary trial when the owner publicly doubted the nür n berger 's origin .
" containers of low quality pork are shipped to nuremberg from the netherlands , " he said at his first court appearance in april , adding that he was worried that the peppery nuremberg sausage would n't be good enough to satisfy his guests ' demanding palates . " neither the manufactures nor the ingredients for the sausage are from nuremberg . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurembergers love their sausages so much that they serve them on heart-shaped plates nuremberg 's residents obviously could n't sit back and let someone attack their sausage and its over 300 years of history .
since the production nür n berger s is protected by european union rules that limit nür n berger bratwurst to those made in the bavarian city with a prescribed recipe , the city took beck back to court .
the judge left beck the choice of either changing the establishment 's name or abiding by eu rules , meaning that he would use sausages from nuremberg and not those made out of just any bavarian pork .
things could get expensive for beck if he does n't follow the court 's rule : he 'd face a fine of 5,100 euros -lrb- $ 6,013 -rrb- for every nür n berger want-to-be he sells . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bavarian sausage wars butchers in the city of munich are locked in a bitter dispute with their counterparts in other parts of bavaria over who should be given the patent for " weisswurst , " or " white sausage , " a local speciality .

the money , seized from criminals , will be made available to groups working in areas worst affected by gun , gang and knife crime .
the ten projects to be awarded funding operate mainly in lambeth , newham , southwark , haringey , brent and hackney .
figures from a recent charity survey reveal that 1 % of children in some high crime areas have carried a handgun .

most commentators argue she will have to tread a fine line both at home and abroad if she is to make her coalition government a success .
' watershed ' previous changes of power , says germany 's handelsblatt , have led to clear changes of direction .
" willy brandt stood for a new ostpolitik , helmut kohl propagated spiritual and moral regeneration , gerhard schroeder implemented the spd-green project at national level , " it recalls .
but what angela merkel stands for , the paper suggests , is not so clear .
she has , however , often been underestimated in the past , it adds , and " that gives grounds for hope " .
merkel has won the chancellorship but not the future sueddeutsche zeitung die welt is another paper in positive mood .
it acknowledges that the coalition government faces a " well-nigh unmanageable task " to resolve long-standing problems , but believes mrs merkel is better equipped than most to answer the call .
" the country is at a historical watershed , " the paper says , " because a courageous politician is setting out to seize opportunities " .
but the sueddeutsche zeitung refuses to buy into this optimism .
" merkel has won the chancellorship but not the future , " the paper predicts .
" she has been unable to generate the christian democrat feel-good factor . "
the enemy within whatever their opinion of mrs merkel 's political skills , many german papers agree that much depends on how she handles her so-called " grand coalition " .
" if , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , " the chancellor were to manage to win over the social democrats for a reform alliance for germany 's renewal worthy of the name , then this coalition could actually become a great one . "
but the paper also warns that mrs merkel 's reliance on the social democrats is her " greatest weakness " .
one word - mediocrity - characterises the start of merkel 's chancellorship der standard the frankfurter rundschau also sees the possible lack of support from within the coalition as a factor .

the campaign , developed by safefood , the food safety promotion board , is targeting food such as chocolate , crisps , sweets , cakes and biscuits .
" at the moment , children are eating , on average , around twice as many treat foods as they should be , " safefood nutritionist dr marian faughnan said .
these contain few nutrients other than calories , fat or sugar , she said .
" in order to protect their child 's health now and in adulthood , there is a need to reduce these foods in their child 's diet and replace them with more nutritious foods , " dr faughnan said .
research by queen 's university and the university of ulster , carried out as part of the young hearts study , showed that among 12 and 15-year-olds the percentage of children overweight or obese has increased by more than a quarter in the past decade .
excessive body weight is linked to the development of heart disease and diabetes .
a recent uk national diet and nutrition survey also revealed that a quarter of the fat in children 's diet came from treat foods .
dr cliodhna foley-nolan , safefood 's chief public health specialist , said they were not telling parents to completely cut treats out of their children 's diets .
" we are simply encouraging parents to view treats , as treats .
" by reducing the quantity of treats given to children , parents will be taking the first step towards improving their child 's health in the long-term . "

" in order to protect their child 's health now and in adulthood , there is a need to reduce these foods in their child 's diet and replace them with more nutritious foods , " dr faughnan said .
research by queen 's university and the university of ulster , carried out as part of the young hearts study , showed that among 12 and 15-year-olds the percentage of children overweight or obese has increased by more than a quarter in the past decade .
excessive body weight is linked to the development of heart disease and diabetes .
a recent uk national diet and nutrition survey also revealed that a quarter of the fat in children 's diet came from treat foods .
dr cliodhna foley-nolan , safefood 's chief public health specialist , said they were not telling parents to completely cut treats out of their children 's diets .
" we are simply encouraging parents to view treats , as treats .
" by reducing the quantity of treats given to children , parents will be taking the first step towards improving their child 's health in the long-term . "

the advertising standards authority -lrb- asa -rrb- ruled that the advertisements were " denigratory " to edf energy .
edf energy , owned by french giant electricite de france , complained that the references to its parent company were likely to confuse uk customers .
a british gas spokesman said the ruling was " political correctness gone mad " .
two of the british gas adverts referred to edf energy as " derived from electricite de france " while a third said the company was " formerly known as electricite de france " .
' misleading ' following an investigation , the asa said the adverts breached an industry code . "
does the asa really believe that pointing out the nationality of a company denigrates that organisation ? "
british gas spokesman it said : " we considered readers were likely to understand that edf energy 's product and business was french .
we considered the ads were misleading and denigratory and suggested the origin of the product was france . "
however , the industry watchdog did not uphold complaints from two members of the public who said the adverts were xenophobic and intended to provoke racism towards france .
edf said it was satisfied with the ruling , and stressed it was investing in the uk , keeping its call centres in the uk and had launched a final salary pension for uk employees .
a spokesman for british gas , which is owned by centrica , said that " no one is suggesting there is anything wrong with edf energy being a french company " .
" does the asa really believe that pointing out the nationality of a company denigrates that organisation ? " he added .
" we like the french .
we would dearly love to sell them gas and electricity .
" unfortunately the french government do n't want a foreign company selling gas to their residential consumers . "
british gas now wants an independent review of the asa decision .
