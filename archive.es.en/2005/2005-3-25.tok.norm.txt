when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the absence of islam at school , students can attend koran classes political powers are against that , for a specific reason .
seefeld said there are fears among some politicians that as long as the islamic federation is responsible for teaching the koran in berlin schools , islamic fundamentalism could rise .
however , the debate can only continue to rage for a few more days , as a ballot at the beginning of april will decide the issue once and for all . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for islam in german schools germany 's many muslim groups plan to unite under one umbrella in an effort to ensure that islam can be taught in public schools , better integrating children and combating the influence of fundamentalists .

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling .

the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .

the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .
in berlin , a new graduate working as an assistant in a dental office might bring home 1,000 euros a month .
in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .

the court supported the position taken by lawyers for jehovah 's witnesses that reports from people who had left that society were unreliable . “ if you have out of a hundred or two hundred thousand jehovah ’ s witnesses , 10 or 15 who say something like that , well you can go to any of the churches , the catholic church or others too , and ask was there anything you were discontented with ? " said richard kelsey , an american who for years has been part of the jehovah 's witnesses ' leadership in germany . the head of germany 's evangelical council , bishop wolfgang huber , criticized the court 's decision in an interview with german radio station info radio . " i am very surprised that the court did not give more weight to the arguments put by the berlin senate , " he said . legal rights , tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new member of jehovah 's witnesses is baptized in ukraine in 2003 during a four day international congress .
the court decision allows jehovah 's witnesses to employ clergy , collect church tax , and establish charitable organizations .
it also gives them tax breaks . despite the favorable ruling , the church said it won ’ t fundamentally change its activities . “ we have the right to preach , we have the right to assemble , and that ’ s what we ’ ll continue to do , but we will not be wanting to collect taxes , ” kelsey said . under the nazi regime , jehovah ’ s witnesses were sent to concentration camps .
they were also banned by east germany 's communists . jehovah 's witnesses assume a position of complete political neutrality , will not join the armed forces , and refuse even to salute a flag , considering their only allegiance to be to god . the berlin ruling has wider national implications as this is the first time jehovah 's witnesses , whose german headquarters are in berlin , have fought for recognition in the country .
the group may now seek a similar status in germany 's 15 other states .
there are around 166,000 jehovah 's witnesses in germany today . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2005 religious education under threat in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how important is the role of religion in berlin 's schools ?
when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the absence of islam at school , students can attend koran classes political powers are against that , for a specific reason .
seefeld said there are fears among some politicians that as long as the islamic federation is responsible for teaching the koran in berlin schools , islamic fundamentalism could rise .
however , the debate can only continue to rage for a few more days , as a ballot at the beginning of april will decide the issue once and for all . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for islam in german schools germany 's many muslim groups plan to unite under one umbrella in an effort to ensure that islam can be taught in public schools , better integrating children and combating the influence of fundamentalists .

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "

" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .

the court supported the position taken by lawyers for jehovah 's witnesses that reports from people who had left that society were unreliable . “ if you have out of a hundred or two hundred thousand jehovah ’ s witnesses , 10 or 15 who say something like that , well you can go to any of the churches , the catholic church or others too , and ask was there anything you were discontented with ? " said richard kelsey , an american who for years has been part of the jehovah 's witnesses ' leadership in germany . the head of germany 's evangelical council , bishop wolfgang huber , criticized the court 's decision in an interview with german radio station info radio .

the court decision allows jehovah 's witnesses to employ clergy , collect church tax , and establish charitable organizations .
it also gives them tax breaks . despite the favorable ruling , the church said it won ’ t fundamentally change its activities . “ we have the right to preach , we have the right to assemble , and that ’ s what we ’ ll continue to do , but we will not be wanting to collect taxes , ” kelsey said . under the nazi regime , jehovah ’ s witnesses were sent to concentration camps .
they were also banned by east germany 's communists . jehovah 's witnesses assume a position of complete political neutrality , will not join the armed forces , and refuse even to salute a flag , considering their only allegiance to be to god . the berlin ruling has wider national implications as this is the first time jehovah 's witnesses , whose german headquarters are in berlin , have fought for recognition in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2005 young german dentists head north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs dentists , but they 're flocking to norway poor prospects in germany and an eu labor market that makes mobility easy has increased the incidence of " brain drain , " where specialists leave home to work abroad .
the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .
in berlin , a new graduate working as an assistant in a dental office might bring home 1,000 euros a month .
in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .
" you do n't have the feeling you 're in a small town . " there are other factors that work against eastern germany when it comes to attracting german dentists .
in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .
even if the will is there , the means are often not .
it can cost upwards of 500,000 euros to start a new practice .
few new dentists have those kinds of resources at their disposal . empty towns , absent patients another problem is emigration .
the bad economy and lack of jobs have forced many easterners to leave the region .
in the eastern border town of görlitz , over 50,000 people have left over the past few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg in the state of saxony-anhalt even if new dentists had the desire to open a practice there , they would have to face the real danger that their patient base would continue to shrink . there are other issues that discourage doctors from settling down in the east .
medical professionals in eastern germany are still paid less than their colleagues in the west . " recent health care reforms also are n't exactly cause for motivation or enjoyment at work , " said wolfgang schmiedel , an orthodontist and president of a dentists ' association in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he cites the increasing amount of bureaucracy dentists have to wade through , paperwork that can take up to 40 percent of the working day .
the new 10-euro fees that the reforms put into place as well as welfare reforms have made many people reconsider making an appointment to have their teeth checked . " especially older people , who do n't have the money , avoid coming in , " schmiedel said .
" my practice is really feeling it . " he estimates that from 10 to 15 percent of berlin doctors ' practices are just barely making it financially .
when younger people see that , they think twice about their futures and more stable careers like those on offer in norway , start to look very attractive . susanne gupta -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prize-winning economist defies brain drain professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .

the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .
in berlin , a new graduate working as an assistant in a dental office might bring home 1,000 euros a month .
in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .
" you do n't have the feeling you 're in a small town . " there are other factors that work against eastern germany when it comes to attracting german dentists .
in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .
even if the will is there , the means are often not .
it can cost upwards of 500,000 euros to start a new practice .
few new dentists have those kinds of resources at their disposal . empty towns , absent patients another problem is emigration .
the bad economy and lack of jobs have forced many easterners to leave the region .
in the eastern border town of görlitz , over 50,000 people have left over the past few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg in the state of saxony-anhalt even if new dentists had the desire to open a practice there , they would have to face the real danger that their patient base would continue to shrink . there are other issues that discourage doctors from settling down in the east .
medical professionals in eastern germany are still paid less than their colleagues in the west . " recent health care reforms also are n't exactly cause for motivation or enjoyment at work , " said wolfgang schmiedel , an orthodontist and president of a dentists ' association in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he cites the increasing amount of bureaucracy dentists have to wade through , paperwork that can take up to 40 percent of the working day .
the new 10-euro fees that the reforms put into place as well as welfare reforms have made many people reconsider making an appointment to have their teeth checked . " especially older people , who do n't have the money , avoid coming in , " schmiedel said .
" my practice is really feeling it . " he estimates that from 10 to 15 percent of berlin doctors ' practices are just barely making it financially .
when younger people see that , they think twice about their futures and more stable careers like those on offer in norway , start to look very attractive . susanne gupta -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prize-winning economist defies brain drain professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 25.03.2005 us training to aid german world cup bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goalkeeper oliver kahn is put through his paces just because they 're not playing in the bundesliga is no reason not to train .
german national team coach jürgen klinsmann is toughening players with drills and training exercises out of an american-style play book . germany is playing a friendly against slovenia in celje on saturday , but the training has n't been a walk in the park , even though as hosts , germany need not qualify for the competition .
german national coach jürgen klinsmann believes his team must be one of the fittest in world soccer if they are to achieve their aim of world cup glory in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national team striker kevin kuranyi gets a blood test as part of the team 's fitness training he brought in his own fitness trainers from the united states to get his players into shape with regime of weight-lifting , body fat tests and endless shuttle runs to test their physical condition to the maximum .
tempo , speed and stamina " we want to play at a high tempo and put the opposition under pressure to force a mistake , " klinsmann explained .
" over the next few months we will work on tempo , speed and stamina . "
the media laughed when german soccer stars , including tough-guy goalie oliver kahn , started sprinting with elastic bands holding them back , but the images have become commonplace in the german training camp and no one is getting excited about the new regiment anymore - even when it takes on a yoga-like flexibility exercise .
working with germans an honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack sprints his way to even better fitness as a way of improving his team 's world cup chances mark verstegen , the american who is responsible for much of the team 's conditioning , told the süddeutsche zeitung working with the german national squad was " a great honor . "
verstegen still has some work ahead of him though .
germany 's 2-2 draw against argentina in february underlined how far klinsmann 's team were in terms of fitness with a frantic tempo set for 70 minutes only for some tired legs to chase shadows as argentina gave a lesson in the art of keeping possession .
" if it comes to extra-time in the world cup , fitness levels will be vital , " explained klinsmann 's assistant , joachim löw .

german national team coach jürgen klinsmann is toughening players with drills and training exercises out of an american-style play book . germany is playing a friendly against slovenia in celje on saturday , but the training has n't been a walk in the park , even though as hosts , germany need not qualify for the competition .
german national coach jürgen klinsmann believes his team must be one of the fittest in world soccer if they are to achieve their aim of world cup glory in 2006 .

" over the next few months we will work on tempo , speed and stamina . "
the media laughed when german soccer stars , including tough-guy goalie oliver kahn , started sprinting with elastic bands holding them back , but the images have become commonplace in the german training camp and no one is getting excited about the new regiment anymore - even when it takes on a yoga-like flexibility exercise .

"
verstegen still has some work ahead of him though .
germany 's 2-2 draw against argentina in february underlined how far klinsmann 's team were in terms of fitness with a frantic tempo set for 70 minutes only for some tired legs to chase shadows as argentina gave a lesson in the art of keeping possession .
" if it comes to extra-time in the world cup , fitness levels will be vital , " explained klinsmann 's assistant , joachim löw .
" at the world cup we may need to be able to play at a high tempo for 120 minutes every three days . " 300,000 reasons to win the players have 300,000 news reasons to work out .

the bonus is three times more than was offered for the 2002 world cup .
germany 's stars will receive 50,000 euros each for reaching the quarter-finals , 100,000 euros for the semi-finals and 150,000 euros for a final appearance in a deal that dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said is " strongly geared toward success . "

the court supported the position taken by lawyers for jehovah 's witnesses that reports from people who had left that society were unreliable . “ if you have out of a hundred or two hundred thousand jehovah ’ s witnesses , 10 or 15 who say something like that , well you can go to any of the churches , the catholic church or others too , and ask was there anything you were discontented with ? " said richard kelsey , an american who for years has been part of the jehovah 's witnesses ' leadership in germany . the head of germany 's evangelical council , bishop wolfgang huber , criticized the court 's decision in an interview with german radio station info radio . " i am very surprised that the court did not give more weight to the arguments put by the berlin senate , " he said . legal rights , tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new member of jehovah 's witnesses is baptized in ukraine in 2003 during a four day international congress .
the court decision allows jehovah 's witnesses to employ clergy , collect church tax , and establish charitable organizations .
it also gives them tax breaks . despite the favorable ruling , the church said it won ’ t fundamentally change its activities . “ we have the right to preach , we have the right to assemble , and that ’ s what we ’ ll continue to do , but we will not be wanting to collect taxes , ” kelsey said . under the nazi regime , jehovah ’ s witnesses were sent to concentration camps .
they were also banned by east germany 's communists . jehovah 's witnesses assume a position of complete political neutrality , will not join the armed forces , and refuse even to salute a flag , considering their only allegiance to be to god . the berlin ruling has wider national implications as this is the first time jehovah 's witnesses , whose german headquarters are in berlin , have fought for recognition in the country .
the group may now seek a similar status in germany 's 15 other states .
there are around 166,000 jehovah 's witnesses in germany today . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration head wants imams to speak german germany 's integration commissioner wants imams who come to the country from abroad to have a knowledge of german and german society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2005 young german dentists head north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs dentists , but they 're flocking to norway poor prospects in germany and an eu labor market that makes mobility easy has increased the incidence of " brain drain , " where specialists leave home to work abroad .
the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .
in berlin , a new graduate working as an assistant in a dental office might bring home 1,000 euros a month .
in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .
" you do n't have the feeling you 're in a small town . " there are other factors that work against eastern germany when it comes to attracting german dentists .
in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .
even if the will is there , the means are often not .
it can cost upwards of 500,000 euros to start a new practice .
few new dentists have those kinds of resources at their disposal . empty towns , absent patients another problem is emigration .
the bad economy and lack of jobs have forced many easterners to leave the region .
in the eastern border town of görlitz , over 50,000 people have left over the past few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg in the state of saxony-anhalt even if new dentists had the desire to open a practice there , they would have to face the real danger that their patient base would continue to shrink . there are other issues that discourage doctors from settling down in the east .
medical professionals in eastern germany are still paid less than their colleagues in the west . " recent health care reforms also are n't exactly cause for motivation or enjoyment at work , " said wolfgang schmiedel , an orthodontist and president of a dentists ' association in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he cites the increasing amount of bureaucracy dentists have to wade through , paperwork that can take up to 40 percent of the working day .
the new 10-euro fees that the reforms put into place as well as welfare reforms have made many people reconsider making an appointment to have their teeth checked . " especially older people , who do n't have the money , avoid coming in , " schmiedel said .
" my practice is really feeling it . " he estimates that from 10 to 15 percent of berlin doctors ' practices are just barely making it financially .
when younger people see that , they think twice about their futures and more stable careers like those on offer in norway , start to look very attractive . susanne gupta -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prize-winning economist defies brain drain professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .

the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .
in berlin , a new graduate working as an assistant in a dental office might bring home 1,000 euros a month .
in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .
" you do n't have the feeling you 're in a small town . " there are other factors that work against eastern germany when it comes to attracting german dentists .
in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .
even if the will is there , the means are often not .
it can cost upwards of 500,000 euros to start a new practice .
few new dentists have those kinds of resources at their disposal . empty towns , absent patients another problem is emigration .
the bad economy and lack of jobs have forced many easterners to leave the region .
in the eastern border town of görlitz , over 50,000 people have left over the past few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg in the state of saxony-anhalt even if new dentists had the desire to open a practice there , they would have to face the real danger that their patient base would continue to shrink . there are other issues that discourage doctors from settling down in the east .
medical professionals in eastern germany are still paid less than their colleagues in the west . " recent health care reforms also are n't exactly cause for motivation or enjoyment at work , " said wolfgang schmiedel , an orthodontist and president of a dentists ' association in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he cites the increasing amount of bureaucracy dentists have to wade through , paperwork that can take up to 40 percent of the working day .
the new 10-euro fees that the reforms put into place as well as welfare reforms have made many people reconsider making an appointment to have their teeth checked . " especially older people , who do n't have the money , avoid coming in , " schmiedel said .
" my practice is really feeling it . " he estimates that from 10 to 15 percent of berlin doctors ' practices are just barely making it financially .
when younger people see that , they think twice about their futures and more stable careers like those on offer in norway , start to look very attractive . susanne gupta -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prize-winning economist defies brain drain professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the absence of islam at school , students can attend koran classes political powers are against that , for a specific reason .
seefeld said there are fears among some politicians that as long as the islamic federation is responsible for teaching the koran in berlin schools , islamic fundamentalism could rise .
however , the debate can only continue to rage for a few more days , as a ballot at the beginning of april will decide the issue once and for all . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for islam in german schools germany 's many muslim groups plan to unite under one umbrella in an effort to ensure that islam can be taught in public schools , better integrating children and combating the influence of fundamentalists .

the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .
in berlin , a new graduate working as an assistant in a dental office might bring home 1,000 euros a month .
in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .
" you do n't have the feeling you 're in a small town . " there are other factors that work against eastern germany when it comes to attracting german dentists .
in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .
even if the will is there , the means are often not .
it can cost upwards of 500,000 euros to start a new practice .
few new dentists have those kinds of resources at their disposal . empty towns , absent patients another problem is emigration .
the bad economy and lack of jobs have forced many easterners to leave the region .
in the eastern border town of görlitz , over 50,000 people have left over the past few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg in the state of saxony-anhalt even if new dentists had the desire to open a practice there , they would have to face the real danger that their patient base would continue to shrink . there are other issues that discourage doctors from settling down in the east .
medical professionals in eastern germany are still paid less than their colleagues in the west . " recent health care reforms also are n't exactly cause for motivation or enjoyment at work , " said wolfgang schmiedel , an orthodontist and president of a dentists ' association in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he cites the increasing amount of bureaucracy dentists have to wade through , paperwork that can take up to 40 percent of the working day .
the new 10-euro fees that the reforms put into place as well as welfare reforms have made many people reconsider making an appointment to have their teeth checked . " especially older people , who do n't have the money , avoid coming in , " schmiedel said .
" my practice is really feeling it . " he estimates that from 10 to 15 percent of berlin doctors ' practices are just barely making it financially .
when younger people see that , they think twice about their futures and more stable careers like those on offer in norway , start to look very attractive . susanne gupta -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prize-winning economist defies brain drain professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2005 religious education under threat in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how important is the role of religion in berlin 's schools ?
when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the absence of islam at school , students can attend koran classes political powers are against that , for a specific reason .
seefeld said there are fears among some politicians that as long as the islamic federation is responsible for teaching the koran in berlin schools , islamic fundamentalism could rise .
however , the debate can only continue to rage for a few more days , as a ballot at the beginning of april will decide the issue once and for all . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for islam in german schools germany 's many muslim groups plan to unite under one umbrella in an effort to ensure that islam can be taught in public schools , better integrating children and combating the influence of fundamentalists .

the court supported the position taken by lawyers for jehovah 's witnesses that reports from people who had left that society were unreliable . “ if you have out of a hundred or two hundred thousand jehovah ’ s witnesses , 10 or 15 who say something like that , well you can go to any of the churches , the catholic church or others too , and ask was there anything you were discontented with ? " said richard kelsey , an american who for years has been part of the jehovah 's witnesses ' leadership in germany . the head of germany 's evangelical council , bishop wolfgang huber , criticized the court 's decision in an interview with german radio station info radio . " i am very surprised that the court did not give more weight to the arguments put by the berlin senate , " he said . legal rights , tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new member of jehovah 's witnesses is baptized in ukraine in 2003 during a four day international congress .
the court decision allows jehovah 's witnesses to employ clergy , collect church tax , and establish charitable organizations .
it also gives them tax breaks . despite the favorable ruling , the church said it won ’ t fundamentally change its activities . “ we have the right to preach , we have the right to assemble , and that ’ s what we ’ ll continue to do , but we will not be wanting to collect taxes , ” kelsey said . under the nazi regime , jehovah ’ s witnesses were sent to concentration camps .

german national team coach jürgen klinsmann is toughening players with drills and training exercises out of an american-style play book . germany is playing a friendly against slovenia in celje on saturday , but the training has n't been a walk in the park , even though as hosts , germany need not qualify for the competition .
german national coach jürgen klinsmann believes his team must be one of the fittest in world soccer if they are to achieve their aim of world cup glory in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national team striker kevin kuranyi gets a blood test as part of the team 's fitness training he brought in his own fitness trainers from the united states to get his players into shape with regime of weight-lifting , body fat tests and endless shuttle runs to test their physical condition to the maximum .
tempo , speed and stamina " we want to play at a high tempo and put the opposition under pressure to force a mistake , " klinsmann explained .
" over the next few months we will work on tempo , speed and stamina . "
the media laughed when german soccer stars , including tough-guy goalie oliver kahn , started sprinting with elastic bands holding them back , but the images have become commonplace in the german training camp and no one is getting excited about the new regiment anymore - even when it takes on a yoga-like flexibility exercise .
working with germans an honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack sprints his way to even better fitness as a way of improving his team 's world cup chances mark verstegen , the american who is responsible for much of the team 's conditioning , told the süddeutsche zeitung working with the german national squad was " a great honor . "
verstegen still has some work ahead of him though .
germany 's 2-2 draw against argentina in february underlined how far klinsmann 's team were in terms of fitness with a frantic tempo set for 70 minutes only for some tired legs to chase shadows as argentina gave a lesson in the art of keeping possession .
" if it comes to extra-time in the world cup , fitness levels will be vital , " explained klinsmann 's assistant , joachim löw .
" at the world cup we may need to be able to play at a high tempo for 120 minutes every three days . " 300,000 reasons to win the players have 300,000 news reasons to work out .
that 's how many euros -lrb- $ 389,000 -rrb- they will receive from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- if they win the final in berlin on july 9 , 2006 .
the bonus is three times more than was offered for the 2002 world cup .
germany 's stars will receive 50,000 euros each for reaching the quarter-finals , 100,000 euros for the semi-finals and 150,000 euros for a final appearance in a deal that dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said is " strongly geared toward success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann psychologically , team coach klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- is also geared toward success .

the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .
in berlin , a new graduate working as an assistant in a dental office might bring home 1,000 euros a month .
in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .
" you do n't have the feeling you 're in a small town . " there are other factors that work against eastern germany when it comes to attracting german dentists .
in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .
even if the will is there , the means are often not .
it can cost upwards of 500,000 euros to start a new practice .
few new dentists have those kinds of resources at their disposal . empty towns , absent patients another problem is emigration .
the bad economy and lack of jobs have forced many easterners to leave the region .
in the eastern border town of görlitz , over 50,000 people have left over the past few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg in the state of saxony-anhalt even if new dentists had the desire to open a practice there , they would have to face the real danger that their patient base would continue to shrink . there are other issues that discourage doctors from settling down in the east .
medical professionals in eastern germany are still paid less than their colleagues in the west . " recent health care reforms also are n't exactly cause for motivation or enjoyment at work , " said wolfgang schmiedel , an orthodontist and president of a dentists ' association in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he cites the increasing amount of bureaucracy dentists have to wade through , paperwork that can take up to 40 percent of the working day .
the new 10-euro fees that the reforms put into place as well as welfare reforms have made many people reconsider making an appointment to have their teeth checked . " especially older people , who do n't have the money , avoid coming in , " schmiedel said .
" my practice is really feeling it . " he estimates that from 10 to 15 percent of berlin doctors ' practices are just barely making it financially .
when younger people see that , they think twice about their futures and more stable careers like those on offer in norway , start to look very attractive . susanne gupta -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prize-winning economist defies brain drain professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .

in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .
" you do n't have the feeling you 're in a small town . " there are other factors that work against eastern germany when it comes to attracting german dentists .
in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .
even if the will is there , the means are often not .
it can cost upwards of 500,000 euros to start a new practice .
few new dentists have those kinds of resources at their disposal . empty towns , absent patients another problem is emigration .
the bad economy and lack of jobs have forced many easterners to leave the region .
in the eastern border town of görlitz , over 50,000 people have left over the past few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg in the state of saxony-anhalt even if new dentists had the desire to open a practice there , they would have to face the real danger that their patient base would continue to shrink . there are other issues that discourage doctors from settling down in the east .
medical professionals in eastern germany are still paid less than their colleagues in the west . " recent health care reforms also are n't exactly cause for motivation or enjoyment at work , " said wolfgang schmiedel , an orthodontist and president of a dentists ' association in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he cites the increasing amount of bureaucracy dentists have to wade through , paperwork that can take up to 40 percent of the working day .
the new 10-euro fees that the reforms put into place as well as welfare reforms have made many people reconsider making an appointment to have their teeth checked . " especially older people , who do n't have the money , avoid coming in , " schmiedel said .
" my practice is really feeling it . " he estimates that from 10 to 15 percent of berlin doctors ' practices are just barely making it financially .
when younger people see that , they think twice about their futures and more stable careers like those on offer in norway , start to look very attractive . susanne gupta -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prize-winning economist defies brain drain professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .

stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "

under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .

it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the absence of islam at school , students can attend koran classes political powers are against that , for a specific reason .
seefeld said there are fears among some politicians that as long as the islamic federation is responsible for teaching the koran in berlin schools , islamic fundamentalism could rise .
however , the debate can only continue to rage for a few more days , as a ballot at the beginning of april will decide the issue once and for all . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for islam in german schools germany 's many muslim groups plan to unite under one umbrella in an effort to ensure that islam can be taught in public schools , better integrating children and combating the influence of fundamentalists .

in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .
" you do n't have the feeling you 're in a small town . " there are other factors that work against eastern germany when it comes to attracting german dentists .
in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .
even if the will is there , the means are often not .
it can cost upwards of 500,000 euros to start a new practice .
few new dentists have those kinds of resources at their disposal . empty towns , absent patients another problem is emigration .
the bad economy and lack of jobs have forced many easterners to leave the region .
in the eastern border town of görlitz , over 50,000 people have left over the past few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg in the state of saxony-anhalt even if new dentists had the desire to open a practice there , they would have to face the real danger that their patient base would continue to shrink . there are other issues that discourage doctors from settling down in the east .
medical professionals in eastern germany are still paid less than their colleagues in the west . " recent health care reforms also are n't exactly cause for motivation or enjoyment at work , " said wolfgang schmiedel , an orthodontist and president of a dentists ' association in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he cites the increasing amount of bureaucracy dentists have to wade through , paperwork that can take up to 40 percent of the working day .
the new 10-euro fees that the reforms put into place as well as welfare reforms have made many people reconsider making an appointment to have their teeth checked . " especially older people , who do n't have the money , avoid coming in , " schmiedel said .
" my practice is really feeling it . " he estimates that from 10 to 15 percent of berlin doctors ' practices are just barely making it financially .
when younger people see that , they think twice about their futures and more stable careers like those on offer in norway , start to look very attractive . susanne gupta -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prize-winning economist defies brain drain professor axel ockenfels has been awarded the prestigious 2005 gottfried wilhelm leibniz prize .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2005 religious education under threat in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how important is the role of religion in berlin 's schools ?
when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .

the court supported the position taken by lawyers for jehovah 's witnesses that reports from people who had left that society were unreliable . “ if you have out of a hundred or two hundred thousand jehovah ’ s witnesses , 10 or 15 who say something like that , well you can go to any of the churches , the catholic church or others too , and ask was there anything you were discontented with ? " said richard kelsey , an american who for years has been part of the jehovah 's witnesses ' leadership in germany . the head of germany 's evangelical council , bishop wolfgang huber , criticized the court 's decision in an interview with german radio station info radio . " i am very surprised that the court did not give more weight to the arguments put by the berlin senate , " he said . legal rights , tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new member of jehovah 's witnesses is baptized in ukraine in 2003 during a four day international congress .
the court decision allows jehovah 's witnesses to employ clergy , collect church tax , and establish charitable organizations .
it also gives them tax breaks . despite the favorable ruling , the church said it won ’ t fundamentally change its activities . “ we have the right to preach , we have the right to assemble , and that ’ s what we ’ ll continue to do , but we will not be wanting to collect taxes , ” kelsey said . under the nazi regime , jehovah ’ s witnesses were sent to concentration camps .
they were also banned by east germany 's communists . jehovah 's witnesses assume a position of complete political neutrality , will not join the armed forces , and refuse even to salute a flag , considering their only allegiance to be to god . the berlin ruling has wider national implications as this is the first time jehovah 's witnesses , whose german headquarters are in berlin , have fought for recognition in the country .
the group may now seek a similar status in germany 's 15 other states .

german national team coach jürgen klinsmann is toughening players with drills and training exercises out of an american-style play book . germany is playing a friendly against slovenia in celje on saturday , but the training has n't been a walk in the park , even though as hosts , germany need not qualify for the competition .
german national coach jürgen klinsmann believes his team must be one of the fittest in world soccer if they are to achieve their aim of world cup glory in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national team striker kevin kuranyi gets a blood test as part of the team 's fitness training he brought in his own fitness trainers from the united states to get his players into shape with regime of weight-lifting , body fat tests and endless shuttle runs to test their physical condition to the maximum .

" over the next few months we will work on tempo , speed and stamina . "
the media laughed when german soccer stars , including tough-guy goalie oliver kahn , started sprinting with elastic bands holding them back , but the images have become commonplace in the german training camp and no one is getting excited about the new regiment anymore - even when it takes on a yoga-like flexibility exercise .

"
verstegen still has some work ahead of him though .
germany 's 2-2 draw against argentina in february underlined how far klinsmann 's team were in terms of fitness with a frantic tempo set for 70 minutes only for some tired legs to chase shadows as argentina gave a lesson in the art of keeping possession .
" if it comes to extra-time in the world cup , fitness levels will be vital , " explained klinsmann 's assistant , joachim löw .
" at the world cup we may need to be able to play at a high tempo for 120 minutes every three days . " 300,000 reasons to win the players have 300,000 news reasons to work out .

germany 's stars will receive 50,000 euros each for reaching the quarter-finals , 100,000 euros for the semi-finals and 150,000 euros for a final appearance in a deal that dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said is " strongly geared toward success . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2005 religious education under threat in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how important is the role of religion in berlin 's schools ?
when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the absence of islam at school , students can attend koran classes political powers are against that , for a specific reason .
seefeld said there are fears among some politicians that as long as the islamic federation is responsible for teaching the koran in berlin schools , islamic fundamentalism could rise .
however , the debate can only continue to rage for a few more days , as a ballot at the beginning of april will decide the issue once and for all . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for islam in german schools germany 's many muslim groups plan to unite under one umbrella in an effort to ensure that islam can be taught in public schools , better integrating children and combating the influence of fundamentalists .

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .

under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .

the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .
in berlin , a new graduate working as an assistant in a dental office might bring home 1,000 euros a month .
in norway , the take-home pay for the same work would be 2,700 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norway while the cost of living in norway is higher , the quality of life in kristiansund , where georgiev wants to work , is also far superior to that in eastern germany , where there is now an acute shortage of dentists . according to georgiev , one can not compare kristiansund , with its 17,000 inhabitants , with a corresponding town in germany with the same population . " -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .

in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .

medical professionals in eastern germany are still paid less than their colleagues in the west . " recent health care reforms also are n't exactly cause for motivation or enjoyment at work , " said wolfgang schmiedel , an orthodontist and president of a dentists ' association in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he cites the increasing amount of bureaucracy dentists have to wade through , paperwork that can take up to 40 percent of the working day .
the new 10-euro fees that the reforms put into place as well as welfare reforms have made many people reconsider making an appointment to have their teeth checked . " especially older people , who do n't have the money , avoid coming in , " schmiedel said .
" my practice is really feeling it . " he estimates that from 10 to 15 percent of berlin doctors ' practices are just barely making it financially .

the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .
in berlin , a new graduate working as an assistant in a dental office might bring home 1,000 euros a month .

" -lsb- in kristiansund -rsb- there 's an airport , it has its own theatre , an opera , a good nightlife , " she said .

in the states of brandenburg , saxony or saxony-anhalt , patients sometimes have to drive 80 kilometers to reach the next orthodontist . few want to risk setting up shop in such a sparsely-settled region .
even if the will is there , the means are often not .

the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .

she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .

there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .

it is also the day that neo-nazis led by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have planned to hold a controversial rally at the historic gate after marching past the new holocaust memorial . a berlin city spokesman said the planned party " is completely independent " of the npd rally .
but with thousands of people invited and multiple events running simultaneously , the neo-nazis are pushed out by default . the two-day street festival beginning may 7 will feature cultural performances , political speeches and the live broadcast of a parliamentary debate on the end of world war ii from the reichstag building nearby .
a broad movement including german churches , trade unions , political parties and ordinary citizens came up with the idea and has received full backing from berlin authorities . " i find it politically unbearable that neo-nazis could be able to hold their rally at this site on such a sensitive day , " said berlin 's interior minister eckehardt körting .
" that is why i fully support those who also want to use the right to demonstrate on that day at this location .
now we have to make a decision on which of the two rallies we want to allow .
i assume that an event in which the german parliament participates is considered more important , so the neo-nazis will have to move to another location . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of the npd npd has the right to march berlin ’ s city authorities now hope that the courts will follow their line of argument and move the npd rally on the grounds of upholding public security .
just last week , parliament approved a bill intended to keep neo-nazi demonstrations away from sites dedicated to the victims of the nazi regime . but while the new holocaust memorial in central berlin will now be specially protected , the brandenburg gate will not .
german lawmakers couldn ’ t agree to include the landmark 18th-century gate built by prussian kings in a catalogue of sensitive sites , with some arguing that berlin ’ s most popular location for demonstrations should remain open to public rallies . still , politicians coyly maintain that the right to demonstrate must be protected as much as possible and that the npd has as much a right to its march as other groups , even as it seeks to shut them out . " germany ’ s constitutional court has ruled that the right to demonstrate is one of the most important civil rights in germany , " körting said .
" it must be granted also to those we dislike or even detest .
so you can not simply ban the npd , which is a registered party here , from rallying at the brandenburg gate .
the new law only forbids demonstrations that denigrate the victims of nazism at sites that honor them . " bildunterschrift : berlin 's new holocaust memorial a panic reaction npd spokesman klaus beier called the initiative " a panic reaction " and vowed to challenge its legality through the courts .
" we are going to dig in our heels over the demonstration route , " he told the berliner zeitung . meanwhile , organizers of the festivities hope they are more successful than they were in their last attempts to thwart the npd .
about two years ago , the government wanted to ban the npd on grounds of unconstitutional political activities .
the attempt failed miserably after it became known that the npd leadership was undermined by undercover secret service agents . after the futile attempt , opponents of the extreme right mainly used verbal weapons to counter them .
but recently , the party has been gaining ground after winning seats in regional elections in eastern germany last year .
and after embarrassing behaviour in the saxon regional parliament earlier this year and a 4,000-strong demonstration in dresden in february honoring victims of allied bombing 60 years ago , politicians began to step up their efforts . germany 's mainstream parties now fear a high-profile march through berlin ’ s brandenburg gate on may 8 could be trumpeted by the far-right as another political victory - and tarnish the image of german democracy abroad . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un urges germany to rein in neo-nazism a new report submitted to the united nations human rights commission on monday called on the eu and other member states to ban racist political parties and crack down on neo-nazism , especially in eastern germany . -lrb- march 22 , 2005 -rrb- germany cracks down on neo-nazi music germany 's supreme administrative court has ruled that a neo-nazi rock group that spread racial hatred was a criminal organization , upholding a first such statement in germany against a music band .

it is also the day that neo-nazis led by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have planned to hold a controversial rally at the historic gate after marching past the new holocaust memorial . a berlin city spokesman said the planned party " is completely independent " of the npd rally .
but with thousands of people invited and multiple events running simultaneously , the neo-nazis are pushed out by default . the two-day street festival beginning may 7 will feature cultural performances , political speeches and the live broadcast of a parliamentary debate on the end of world war ii from the reichstag building nearby .
a broad movement including german churches , trade unions , political parties and ordinary citizens came up with the idea and has received full backing from berlin authorities . " i find it politically unbearable that neo-nazis could be able to hold their rally at this site on such a sensitive day , " said berlin 's interior minister eckehardt körting .
" that is why i fully support those who also want to use the right to demonstrate on that day at this location .
now we have to make a decision on which of the two rallies we want to allow .
i assume that an event in which the german parliament participates is considered more important , so the neo-nazis will have to move to another location . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of the npd npd has the right to march berlin ’ s city authorities now hope that the courts will follow their line of argument and move the npd rally on the grounds of upholding public security .
just last week , parliament approved a bill intended to keep neo-nazi demonstrations away from sites dedicated to the victims of the nazi regime . but while the new holocaust memorial in central berlin will now be specially protected , the brandenburg gate will not .
german lawmakers couldn ’ t agree to include the landmark 18th-century gate built by prussian kings in a catalogue of sensitive sites , with some arguing that berlin ’ s most popular location for demonstrations should remain open to public rallies . still , politicians coyly maintain that the right to demonstrate must be protected as much as possible and that the npd has as much a right to its march as other groups , even as it seeks to shut them out . " germany ’ s constitutional court has ruled that the right to demonstrate is one of the most important civil rights in germany , " körting said .
" it must be granted also to those we dislike or even detest .
so you can not simply ban the npd , which is a registered party here , from rallying at the brandenburg gate .
the new law only forbids demonstrations that denigrate the victims of nazism at sites that honor them . " bildunterschrift : berlin 's new holocaust memorial a panic reaction npd spokesman klaus beier called the initiative " a panic reaction " and vowed to challenge its legality through the courts .
" we are going to dig in our heels over the demonstration route , " he told the berliner zeitung . meanwhile , organizers of the festivities hope they are more successful than they were in their last attempts to thwart the npd .
about two years ago , the government wanted to ban the npd on grounds of unconstitutional political activities .
the attempt failed miserably after it became known that the npd leadership was undermined by undercover secret service agents . after the futile attempt , opponents of the extreme right mainly used verbal weapons to counter them .
but recently , the party has been gaining ground after winning seats in regional elections in eastern germany last year .
and after embarrassing behaviour in the saxon regional parliament earlier this year and a 4,000-strong demonstration in dresden in february honoring victims of allied bombing 60 years ago , politicians began to step up their efforts . germany 's mainstream parties now fear a high-profile march through berlin ’ s brandenburg gate on may 8 could be trumpeted by the far-right as another political victory - and tarnish the image of german democracy abroad . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un urges germany to rein in neo-nazism a new report submitted to the united nations human rights commission on monday called on the eu and other member states to ban racist political parties and crack down on neo-nazism , especially in eastern germany . -lrb- march 22 , 2005 -rrb- germany cracks down on neo-nazi music germany 's supreme administrative court has ruled that a neo-nazi rock group that spread racial hatred was a criminal organization , upholding a first such statement in germany against a music band .

it is also the day that neo-nazis led by the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- have planned to hold a controversial rally at the historic gate after marching past the new holocaust memorial . a berlin city spokesman said the planned party " is completely independent " of the npd rally .
but with thousands of people invited and multiple events running simultaneously , the neo-nazis are pushed out by default . the two-day street festival beginning may 7 will feature cultural performances , political speeches and the live broadcast of a parliamentary debate on the end of world war ii from the reichstag building nearby .
a broad movement including german churches , trade unions , political parties and ordinary citizens came up with the idea and has received full backing from berlin authorities . " i find it politically unbearable that neo-nazis could be able to hold their rally at this site on such a sensitive day , " said berlin 's interior minister eckehardt körting .
" that is why i fully support those who also want to use the right to demonstrate on that day at this location .
now we have to make a decision on which of the two rallies we want to allow .
i assume that an event in which the german parliament participates is considered more important , so the neo-nazis will have to move to another location . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags of the npd npd has the right to march berlin ’ s city authorities now hope that the courts will follow their line of argument and move the npd rally on the grounds of upholding public security .
just last week , parliament approved a bill intended to keep neo-nazi demonstrations away from sites dedicated to the victims of the nazi regime . but while the new holocaust memorial in central berlin will now be specially protected , the brandenburg gate will not .
german lawmakers couldn ’ t agree to include the landmark 18th-century gate built by prussian kings in a catalogue of sensitive sites , with some arguing that berlin ’ s most popular location for demonstrations should remain open to public rallies . still , politicians coyly maintain that the right to demonstrate must be protected as much as possible and that the npd has as much a right to its march as other groups , even as it seeks to shut them out . " germany ’ s constitutional court has ruled that the right to demonstrate is one of the most important civil rights in germany , " körting said .
" it must be granted also to those we dislike or even detest .
so you can not simply ban the npd , which is a registered party here , from rallying at the brandenburg gate .
the new law only forbids demonstrations that denigrate the victims of nazism at sites that honor them . " bildunterschrift : berlin 's new holocaust memorial a panic reaction npd spokesman klaus beier called the initiative " a panic reaction " and vowed to challenge its legality through the courts .
" we are going to dig in our heels over the demonstration route , " he told the berliner zeitung . meanwhile , organizers of the festivities hope they are more successful than they were in their last attempts to thwart the npd .
about two years ago , the government wanted to ban the npd on grounds of unconstitutional political activities .
the attempt failed miserably after it became known that the npd leadership was undermined by undercover secret service agents . after the futile attempt , opponents of the extreme right mainly used verbal weapons to counter them .
but recently , the party has been gaining ground after winning seats in regional elections in eastern germany last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2005 religious education under threat in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how important is the role of religion in berlin 's schools ?
when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the absence of islam at school , students can attend koran classes political powers are against that , for a specific reason .
seefeld said there are fears among some politicians that as long as the islamic federation is responsible for teaching the koran in berlin schools , islamic fundamentalism could rise .
however , the debate can only continue to rage for a few more days , as a ballot at the beginning of april will decide the issue once and for all . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing for islam in german schools germany 's many muslim groups plan to unite under one umbrella in an effort to ensure that islam can be taught in public schools , better integrating children and combating the influence of fundamentalists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2005 young german dentists head north großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs dentists , but they 're flocking to norway poor prospects in germany and an eu labor market that makes mobility easy has increased the incidence of " brain drain , " where specialists leave home to work abroad .
the latest german export : dentists . katja georgiev was one of only 16 of her 120 fellow students to complete her degree program in dentistry at berlin 's humboldt university on schedule .
she then immediately started an internship at her parents ' dental practice , where she did well .
but in the end , she decided to pursue a career in norway .
she already has a state-run hospital in the coastal city of kristiansund in sight . it was her time in her parents ' practice that made her decide for scandinavia , she said .
especially when her mother would often tell her to complete a procedure more quickly , since the next patient was already waiting .
she did n't like sacrificing quality for quantity . " up there -lsb- in norway -rsb- i could take an entire hour for a filling , which means the quality is higher , " she said .
" at night i can sleep easily knowing that filling will last another 20 years . " she 's not alone among professionals in seeking her fortune , and future career , beyond germany 's own shores .
in 2004 , germany 's federal job agency referred 3,389 specialists to positions abroad . while germany 's dentists have in the past largely been immune from the country 's unemployment sickness , that is no longer the case .
there are some 900 dentists in germany who can not find work .
in 2001 , 170 of them went to norway to work . norway beckons little wonder , since the quality of dental care in scandinavia is among the best in europe .
the work pace and hours make the northern country an attractive destination , to live and to work .

german national team coach jürgen klinsmann is toughening players with drills and training exercises out of an american-style play book . germany is playing a friendly against slovenia in celje on saturday , but the training has n't been a walk in the park , even though as hosts , germany need not qualify for the competition .
german national coach jürgen klinsmann believes his team must be one of the fittest in world soccer if they are to achieve their aim of world cup glory in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national team striker kevin kuranyi gets a blood test as part of the team 's fitness training he brought in his own fitness trainers from the united states to get his players into shape with regime of weight-lifting , body fat tests and endless shuttle runs to test their physical condition to the maximum .
tempo , speed and stamina " we want to play at a high tempo and put the opposition under pressure to force a mistake , " klinsmann explained .
" over the next few months we will work on tempo , speed and stamina . "
the media laughed when german soccer stars , including tough-guy goalie oliver kahn , started sprinting with elastic bands holding them back , but the images have become commonplace in the german training camp and no one is getting excited about the new regiment anymore - even when it takes on a yoga-like flexibility exercise .
working with germans an honor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany captain michael ballack sprints his way to even better fitness as a way of improving his team 's world cup chances mark verstegen , the american who is responsible for much of the team 's conditioning , told the süddeutsche zeitung working with the german national squad was " a great honor . "
verstegen still has some work ahead of him though .
germany 's 2-2 draw against argentina in february underlined how far klinsmann 's team were in terms of fitness with a frantic tempo set for 70 minutes only for some tired legs to chase shadows as argentina gave a lesson in the art of keeping possession .
" if it comes to extra-time in the world cup , fitness levels will be vital , " explained klinsmann 's assistant , joachim löw .
" at the world cup we may need to be able to play at a high tempo for 120 minutes every three days . " 300,000 reasons to win the players have 300,000 news reasons to work out .
that 's how many euros -lrb- $ 389,000 -rrb- they will receive from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- if they win the final in berlin on july 9 , 2006 .

germany 's stars will receive 50,000 euros each for reaching the quarter-finals , 100,000 euros for the semi-finals and 150,000 euros for a final appearance in a deal that dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder said is " strongly geared toward success . "

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .

the court supported the position taken by lawyers for jehovah 's witnesses that reports from people who had left that society were unreliable . “ if you have out of a hundred or two hundred thousand jehovah ’ s witnesses , 10 or 15 who say something like that , well you can go to any of the churches , the catholic church or others too , and ask was there anything you were discontented with ? " said richard kelsey , an american who for years has been part of the jehovah 's witnesses ' leadership in germany . the head of germany 's evangelical council , bishop wolfgang huber , criticized the court 's decision in an interview with german radio station info radio . " i am very surprised that the court did not give more weight to the arguments put by the berlin senate , " he said . legal rights , tax breaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new member of jehovah 's witnesses is baptized in ukraine in 2003 during a four day international congress .
the court decision allows jehovah 's witnesses to employ clergy , collect church tax , and establish charitable organizations .
it also gives them tax breaks . despite the favorable ruling , the church said it won ’ t fundamentally change its activities . “ we have the right to preach , we have the right to assemble , and that ’ s what we ’ ll continue to do , but we will not be wanting to collect taxes , ” kelsey said . under the nazi regime , jehovah ’ s witnesses were sent to concentration camps .
they were also banned by east germany 's communists . jehovah 's witnesses assume a position of complete political neutrality , will not join the armed forces , and refuse even to salute a flag , considering their only allegiance to be to god . the berlin ruling has wider national implications as this is the first time jehovah 's witnesses , whose german headquarters are in berlin , have fought for recognition in the country .
the group may now seek a similar status in germany 's 15 other states .

when , in 1996 , berlin 's senator for education , proposed introducing mandatory ethic classes in the city 's high schools , he set a slow ball rolling .
almost a decade later , a final decision is about to be taken . at issue is the system of religious education which has been in place in the german capital since before wwii .
it is a complex model allowing school children to choose which religion , if any , they wish to include in their school timetables .
while the rule , which is based on a constitutional clause for religious freedom , is only fair , the problem is that given half a chance to cut back on class hours , a large percentage of students fall over themselves to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free time for all those who want it it is precisely that option to forgo religious education altogether which bothers berlin 's education senator , klaus böger .
his spokeswoman , rita hermanns , said the current system is too lax .
" high school students have a choice between religious studies or going to the ice cream parlor , and that is unsatisfactory .
it 's not right that some pupils have contact with ethics and religious history while others do n't . "
ethics and religion combined what social democratic senator böger has long been proposing for high schools , is the introduction of a completely new , compulsory class which would cover religion , philosophy , ethics and life choices .
and although initial resistance from both his party colleagues and their coalition partners , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , has now transformed into support , böger has another more difficult , problem on his hands .
" the senator wants to see the introduction of this new subject but does n't want to scrap the current opportunities for religious education , " said hermanns .
under böger 's plan , pupils would have to choose between religion class and the new diluted mix of religion , ethics and life choices .
what they would no longer be able to do is simply opt out altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church wants to keep its presence in german schools while böger 's proposals have been warmly welcomed by both the protestant and catholic churches , they have met with consternation among his political peers who are in favor of the new subject but say it should be a must for everyone without discussion . they are calling for just one , state-run subject aimed at introducing students to all main religions and philosophies .
they say that those kids who wish to continue with religious studies could do so as an added extra .
who in their right mind ?
stefan-rainer schultz , a protestant in berlin , said the model is flawed from the outset .
" what normal 14-year-old is going to volunteer to take on extra classes if they do n't actually have to ? "
and while he doubtless has a point , the pds dismisses his argument on the basis that the majority of the 150,000 pupils who opt for religious education at school are too young to be affected by any new ruling . " we know that once children reach high school , the number of those who take religion tails off , " pds spokeswoman kathi seefeld said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a large muslim population the pds argues that given berlin 's multiculturalism , it is crucial to offer upcoming generations access to a broad spectrum of knowledge .
" we want young people to learn about different cultures and religions and to be in a position to think about their own religion and background , " seefeld said .
" one of the problems in berlin is the lack of mutual respect among teenagers , and this new model could help to alleviate the problem . "
choice is of the essence while nobody disagrees with the importance of granting adolescents the opportunity to broaden their horizons , the catholic church is eager to stress the virtue of choice .
" students should be able to choose between ethics and religious studies , " said hans peter richter of the archdiocese of berlin .
" we agree it is perfectly acceptable to have a compulsory area of study , but the church should also be left to do its work in peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many schools offer buddhism the issue of who would teach a mandatory ethics class is another bone of contention in this debate .
currently , religion teachers are not employed by the city 's schools , but by the churches , buddhist organizations or the islamic federation .
under the new system , teachers employed by the state of berlin would cover all aspects of the new curriculum .
" we would draw in unemployed teachers from brandenburg or use those already in berlin who have some experience in the realm of ethics or religion , and there would , of course , be the opportunity to invite experts into classes to talk about certain areas of religion , " seefeld of the pds said .
the need for division but it is precisely the idea of lumping everything together which has both the catholic and protestant churches up in arms .
" it 's too much for one teacher to present each religion in equal measure .
what we need is divided religious education with the opportunity for different groups to come together regularly for an open dialogue on their religious and cultural differences , " richter argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the absence of islam at school , students can attend koran classes political powers are against that , for a specific reason .
seefeld said there are fears among some politicians that as long as the islamic federation is responsible for teaching the koran in berlin schools , islamic fundamentalism could rise .
however , the debate can only continue to rage for a few more days , as a ballot at the beginning of april will decide the issue once and for all . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : pushing for islam in german schools germany 's many muslim groups plan to unite under one umbrella in an effort to ensure that islam can be taught in public schools , better integrating children and combating the influence of fundamentalists .

the court supported the position taken by lawyers for jehovah 's witnesses that reports from people who had left that society were unreliable . “ if you have out of a hundred or two hundred thousand jehovah ’ s witnesses , 10 or 15 who say something like that , well you can go to any of the churches , the catholic church or others too , and ask was there anything you were discontented with ? " said richard kelsey , an american who for years has been part of the jehovah 's witnesses ' leadership in germany . the head of germany 's evangelical council , bishop wolfgang huber , criticized the court 's decision in an interview with german radio station info radio .

the court decision allows jehovah 's witnesses to employ clergy , collect church tax , and establish charitable organizations .
it also gives them tax breaks . despite the favorable ruling , the church said it won ’ t fundamentally change its activities . “ we have the right to preach , we have the right to assemble , and that ’ s what we ’ ll continue to do , but we will not be wanting to collect taxes , ” kelsey said . under the nazi regime , jehovah ’ s witnesses were sent to concentration camps .
they were also banned by east germany 's communists . jehovah 's witnesses assume a position of complete political neutrality , will not join the armed forces , and refuse even to salute a flag , considering their only allegiance to be to god . the berlin ruling has wider national implications as this is the first time jehovah 's witnesses , whose german headquarters are in berlin , have fought for recognition in the country .

latvian police carry out a small , bureaucratic piece of harassment .
with a tape , and much officiousness , they measure the distance between the demonstrators and the nearest public building , a school on the other side of the road .
the protest is two metres too close , so the police move it a little further down the path .
the protesters do n't mind .
they are there to object to a much greater injustice .
more than 450,000 russians and native russian-speakers - out of a total latvian population of 2.3m - are classed as " non-citizens " because they have failed -lrb- or refused -rrb- to take a test in latvian language and history , which would allow them to have citizenship .
this was local election day , and they were protesting about the fact that as " aliens " , despite having lived in latvia all their lives , they had no right to take part in the elections - whereas citizens of other eu countries could vote if they had lived there for a mere six months .
" i was born here , " said one young man .
" i pay the same taxes as latvians .
yet i 'm not allowed to vote for the politicians who spend those taxes . "
" i 'm here to protest against the government 's policy of dividing society along ethnic lines , " said another .
the fate of the non-citizens - who account for 20 % of the entire population of latvia - is a complex one .
soviet migrants when latvia gained independence from the soviet union in 1991 , it granted automatic citizenship to those who had lived in the first independent latvian state - between 1918 and 1940 - but not to those who immigrated here after the war , when latvia was occupied by the soviet union .
latvia suffered hugely under soviet rule .
thousands were arrested and sent to siberian labour camps , or executed , during the stalin years .
later , hundreds of thousands of russians , belarussians and ukrainians flooded into the republic under a deliberate policy of russification .
the latvian language was squeezed out of official use .
latvians were resentful citizens of the ussr .
by 1991 , they comprised only half of the population of their own country , while in riga only a third were latvian .
even today , russian is heard as commonly as latvian on the streets of riga .
but the government is determined to revive the latvian identity .
it says its policy towards russians who immigrated here during the soviet period is aimed not at punishing them for the sins of the soviet regime -lrb- as some suspect -rrb- but at ensuring that they learn latvian and integrate fully into society .
in order to naturalise , russians must take a test in latvian , and pass an exam about latvian history - in which they must " correctly " answer that the country was occupied and colonised , not liberated , by the soviet union in 1945 .
many of the russians at the demonstration on election day said they found that psychologically difficult .
they said they wanted to integrate -lrb- and many could speak latvian -rrb- , but they found the idea of applying for citizenship humiliating .
" i lived here - same as them - and i was a citizen of the ussr , " said a middle-aged woman .
" they deprived me of my citizenship , and now i must apply to become one !
i just wo n't do it . "
separate , but together tatjana zdanoka is latvia 's only russian member of the european parliament and uses her position to publicise the position of the russian minority .
she says her mother , who has lived in latvia for 60 years and worked here for 45 years as a schoolteacher , has no right to vote .
" she is 83 and has bad eyes .
of course she 's not capable of taking any kind of exam . "
facts about latvia latvia was independent from 1918 to 1939 after world war ii it was a part of the ussr it regained independence in 1991 700,000 soviet-time migrants and their children became non-citizens by the time latvia joined the eu in 2004 , this figure had dropped to around 450,000 latvia 's total population is 2,3m -lrb- including non-citizens -rrb- igor vatolin , a journalist on the newspaper chas and a russian rights activist , said the latvian popular front , which led the fight for independence at the end of the 1980s , promised citizenship to everyone living in the republic .
" but they reneged on that - even though thousands of russians voted with them in favour of independence in the referendum of 1991 , " he said .
there is no ethnic strife in the streets of latvia .
the two peoples live peacefully together .
but politicians on both sides , and in russia itself , stir things up .
moscow rarely misses a chance to complain at international meetings of latvia 's " human rights abuses " , while the head of the latvian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , aleksandrs kirsteins , has described the non-citizens as " civilian occupiers " .
he called for an agreement with the russian government under which all the unwanted foreigners would be herded on to trains and shipped back to their " ethnic homeland " - with a brass band playing on the platform to see them off .

latvian police carry out a small , bureaucratic piece of harassment .
with a tape , and much officiousness , they measure the distance between the demonstrators and the nearest public building , a school on the other side of the road .
the protest is two metres too close , so the police move it a little further down the path .
the protesters do n't mind .
they are there to object to a much greater injustice .
more than 450,000 russians and native russian-speakers - out of a total latvian population of 2.3m - are classed as " non-citizens " because they have failed -lrb- or refused -rrb- to take a test in latvian language and history , which would allow them to have citizenship .
this was local election day , and they were protesting about the fact that as " aliens " , despite having lived in latvia all their lives , they had no right to take part in the elections - whereas citizens of other eu countries could vote if they had lived there for a mere six months .
" i was born here , " said one young man .
" i pay the same taxes as latvians .
yet i 'm not allowed to vote for the politicians who spend those taxes . "
" i 'm here to protest against the government 's policy of dividing society along ethnic lines , " said another .
the fate of the non-citizens - who account for 20 % of the entire population of latvia - is a complex one .
soviet migrants when latvia gained independence from the soviet union in 1991 , it granted automatic citizenship to those who had lived in the first independent latvian state - between 1918 and 1940 - but not to those who immigrated here after the war , when latvia was occupied by the soviet union .
latvia suffered hugely under soviet rule .
thousands were arrested and sent to siberian labour camps , or executed , during the stalin years .
mep tatjana zdanoka uses her position to highlight the issue later , hundreds of thousands of russians , belarussians and ukrainians flooded into the republic under a deliberate policy of russification .
the latvian language was squeezed out of official use .
latvians were resentful citizens of the ussr .
by 1991 , they comprised only half of the population of their own country , while in riga only a third were latvian .
even today , russian is heard as commonly as latvian on the streets of riga .
but the government is determined to revive the latvian identity .
it says its policy towards russians who immigrated here during the soviet period is aimed not at punishing them for the sins of the soviet regime -lrb- as some suspect -rrb- but at ensuring that they learn latvian and integrate fully into society .
in order to naturalise , russians must take a test in latvian , and pass an exam about latvian history - in which they must " correctly " answer that the country was occupied and colonised , not liberated , by the soviet union in 1945 .
many of the russians at the demonstration on election day said they found that psychologically difficult .
they said they wanted to integrate -lrb- and many could speak latvian -rrb- , but they found the idea of applying for citizenship humiliating .
" i lived here - same as them - and i was a citizen of the ussr , " said a middle-aged woman .
" they deprived me of my citizenship , and now i must apply to become one !
i just wo n't do it . "
separate , but together tatjana zdanoka is latvia 's only russian member of the european parliament and uses her position to publicise the position of the russian minority .
she says her mother , who has lived in latvia for 60 years and worked here for 45 years as a schoolteacher , has no right to vote .
" she is 83 and has bad eyes .
of course she 's not capable of taking any kind of exam . "

there is no ethnic strife in the streets of latvia .
the two peoples live peacefully together .

he called for an agreement with the russian government under which all the unwanted foreigners would be herded on to trains and shipped back to their " ethnic homeland " - with a brass band playing on the platform to see them off .

soviet migrants when latvia gained independence from the soviet union in 1991 , it granted automatic citizenship to those who had lived in the first independent latvian state - between 1918 and 1940 - but not to those who immigrated here after the war , when latvia was occupied by the soviet union .
latvia suffered hugely under soviet rule .
thousands were arrested and sent to siberian labour camps , or executed , during the stalin years .
mep tatjana zdanoka uses her position to highlight the issue later , hundreds of thousands of russians , belarussians and ukrainians flooded into the republic under a deliberate policy of russification .
the latvian language was squeezed out of official use .
latvians were resentful citizens of the ussr .
by 1991 , they comprised only half of the population of their own country , while in riga only a third were latvian .
even today , russian is heard as commonly as latvian on the streets of riga .
but the government is determined to revive the latvian identity .
it says its policy towards russians who immigrated here during the soviet period is aimed not at punishing them for the sins of the soviet regime -lrb- as some suspect -rrb- but at ensuring that they learn latvian and integrate fully into society .
in order to naturalise , russians must take a test in latvian , and pass an exam about latvian history - in which they must " correctly " answer that the country was occupied and colonised , not liberated , by the soviet union in 1945 .
many of the russians at the demonstration on election day said they found that psychologically difficult .
they said they wanted to integrate -lrb- and many could speak latvian -rrb- , but they found the idea of applying for citizenship humiliating .
" i lived here - same as them - and i was a citizen of the ussr , " said a middle-aged woman .
" they deprived me of my citizenship , and now i must apply to become one !
i just wo n't do it . "
separate , but together tatjana zdanoka is latvia 's only russian member of the european parliament and uses her position to publicise the position of the russian minority .
she says her mother , who has lived in latvia for 60 years and worked here for 45 years as a schoolteacher , has no right to vote .
" she is 83 and has bad eyes .
of course she 's not capable of taking any kind of exam . "
facts about latvia latvia was independent from 1918 to 1939 after world war ii it was a part of the ussr it regained independence in 1991 700,000 soviet-time migrants and their children became non-citizens by the time latvia joined the eu in 2004 , this figure had dropped to around 450,000 latvia 's total population is 2,3m -lrb- including non-citizens -rrb- igor vatolin , a journalist on the newspaper chas and a russian rights activist , said the latvian popular front , which led the fight for independence at the end of the 1980s , promised citizenship to everyone living in the republic .
" but they reneged on that - even though thousands of russians voted with them in favour of independence in the referendum of 1991 , " he said .
there is no ethnic strife in the streets of latvia .
the two peoples live peacefully together .
but politicians on both sides , and in russia itself , stir things up .
moscow rarely misses a chance to complain at international meetings of latvia 's " human rights abuses " , while the head of the latvian parliament 's foreign affairs committee , aleksandrs kirsteins , has described the non-citizens as " civilian occupiers " .
he called for an agreement with the russian government under which all the unwanted foreigners would be herded on to trains and shipped back to their " ethnic homeland " - with a brass band playing on the platform to see them off .
latvia 's two communities deserve credit for by and large ignoring such provocative statements .
despite the bitterness and insecurity on both sides , they have succeeded in forging a peaceful co-existence - somewhat separate , but together .

latvian police carry out a small , bureaucratic piece of harassment .
with a tape , and much officiousness , they measure the distance between the demonstrators and the nearest public building , a school on the other side of the road .
the protest is two metres too close , so the police move it a little further down the path .
the protesters do n't mind .
they are there to object to a much greater injustice .
more than 450,000 russians and native russian-speakers - out of a total latvian population of 2.3m - are classed as " non-citizens " because they have failed -lrb- or refused -rrb- to take a test in latvian language and history , which would allow them to have citizenship .
this was local election day , and they were protesting about the fact that as " aliens " , despite having lived in latvia all their lives , they had no right to take part in the elections - whereas citizens of other eu countries could vote if they had lived there for a mere six months .
" i was born here , " said one young man .
" i pay the same taxes as latvians .
yet i 'm not allowed to vote for the politicians who spend those taxes . "

although poppy seeds are used in making spices , there are fears that drug traffickers could be buying to make heroin .
deals with agents the cultivation of opium in karnataka and parts of southern india has caught the attention of the vienna-based international narcotics control board .
in some of the fields , police found poppies being grown camouflaged between maize , cereal and sugarcane crops .
agriculture minister srinivas gowda says farmers are being exploited by drug dealers .
" most of the farmers did not know that poppy cultivation is prohibited , " he says .
the government , which does not want to be seen as being anti-farmer , has announced an amnesty until 31 march for those farmers who voluntarily surrender the crop .
concerned over the unrest the raids have generated among farmers , a senior leader of the socialist janata dal secular party , hd kumaraswamy , has called for a halt to the crackdown .
" the farmers are naïve and have been growing poppies as any other crop , " he says .

that is double the speed it clocked up to take it to the number one spot in the top 500 supercomputer league .
the ibm blue gene machine that achieved the new mark is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory , a us department of energy -lrb- doe -rrb- lab .
it did 70.72 teraflops last year to beat japan 's nec earth simulator .

thunder , usa its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops , with the machine taking up 64 full racks .
blue gene 's new record was achieved by doubling the number of current racks to 32 .
each rack holds 1,024 processors , yet the chips are the same as those found in high-end computers on the high street .
the processors are special dual-processing engines , known as cores .
the final machine will help scientists work out the safety , security and reliability requirements for the us 's nuclear weapons stockpile , without the need for underground nuclear testing .
everyday problems supercomputing has been used in the past to work out highly complex scientific problems , such as understanding the structure of proteins to eventually improve drugs .
they are also crucial in climate research and in prediction models for natural events , such as tsunamis .
supercomputers can help scientists predict climate change but they are now being used to solve everyday problems , too , such as airport ground traffic .
supercomputing power can also be rented , in some cases , to help out in design or other problem-solving tasks that need tremendous processing power .
ibm recently set up a new unit to start getting its supercomputing power more involved in solving business problems .
the computers that generated lord of the rings characters and places - gollum , the balrog , and middle earth - are now available for hire , for example .
the cluster of 1,008 computers in new zealand can be rented on-demand , on a per hour , per processor basis .
already the supercomputer is being used to design a super yacht and test gene sequencing algorithms .
since the original supercomputer , the cray-1 , was set up at los alamos national laboratory , us , in 1976 , computational speed has jumped by 500,000 times .
the cray-1 was able to do 80 megaflops -lrb- 80 million operations a second -rrb- .

that is double the speed it clocked up to take it to the number one spot in the top 500 supercomputer league .
the ibm blue gene machine that achieved the new mark is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory , a us department of energy -lrb- doe -rrb- lab .

thunder , usa its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops , with the machine taking up 64 full racks .
blue gene 's new record was achieved by doubling the number of current racks to 32 .
each rack holds 1,024 processors , yet the chips are the same as those found in high-end computers on the high street .
the processors are special dual-processing engines , known as cores .
the final machine will help scientists work out the safety , security and reliability requirements for the us 's nuclear weapons stockpile , without the need for underground nuclear testing .
everyday problems supercomputing has been used in the past to work out highly complex scientific problems , such as understanding the structure of proteins to eventually improve drugs .
they are also crucial in climate research and in prediction models for natural events , such as tsunamis .
supercomputers can help scientists predict climate change but they are now being used to solve everyday problems , too , such as airport ground traffic .
supercomputing power can also be rented , in some cases , to help out in design or other problem-solving tasks that need tremendous processing power .
ibm recently set up a new unit to start getting its supercomputing power more involved in solving business problems .
the computers that generated lord of the rings characters and places - gollum , the balrog , and middle earth - are now available for hire , for example .
the cluster of 1,008 computers in new zealand can be rented on-demand , on a per hour , per processor basis .
