they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .

if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .

" car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .

they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .
but as the imminent german defeat approached , the nazi commandant of the facility ordered the salt mines and artworks destroyed . allies liberatio n led to the loss of ma n y works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately , no wholesale destruction occurred and the majority of the collection was confiscated by the allied forces which had already begun to bring works of art recovered from various depots to special collection points where a system was set up to find the legal owners . however , not all the artifacts were returned . speaking in berlin on tuesday , löhr said that his new book reopens the debate as to what became of the art that never found its way home and that the revelations were " explosive . "
löhr suggested that some artworks which hang in museums and collections in berlin have the mark of an original , legal owner somewhere in their history . stole n art u n witti n gly bought all over the world it 's been suggested that after the war , many of the missing works passed through the federal government in bonn and the austrian federal government as well as private collections in both countries while others ended up in the hands of art thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlene von saher points to the painting once owned by her grandfather titled , " the temptation of st. anthony , " in new york .
the painting is part of an extensive collection of old master art that was stolen by the nazis in holland 60 years ago .
löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .
the on-going search for the artifacts and the quest for compensation for the legal owners in most of these cases goes on . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the hassles of returning stolen art a long legal wrangle in germany over the return of three paintings seized by the nazis was resolved on wednesday .

floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .
familiar with the scene , chancellor schröder is already donning his rubber boots . continuing heavy downpours had turned the alpine regions of the southern german state of bavaria and neighboring switzerland and austria on wednesday into a bleak watery landscape . several low-lying areas had been completely submerged , residents had to be rescued by boats and helicopters in many places and tourist hotels were evacuated .
roads and rail lines remained blocked as aid workers and emergency services struggled to shore up dykes and dams with sandbags despite several rivers bursting their banks .
drinking water and electricity were in short supply in some areas following the complete breakdown in public services . bildunterschrift : helpers of the fire department in eschenlohe in bavaria several regions in bavaria such as kempten , augsburg and garmisch-partenkirchen were on red alert after authorities said that water levels had exceeded the catastrophic floods of 1999 , deemed the worst of the century at the time , which hit bavaria . however , in comparison to switzerland and austria , where six people had been killed by tuesday , germany was only counting injured victims of the catastrophe .
on wednesday , authorities were warning that the danube river could submerge its banks as residents of the towns of passau and regensburg were bracing for the flood waters . politicia n s scramble to offer help the unfolding tragedy has also sent the country 's politicians scrambling to the flood-affected areas .
they are in the midst of an election campaign for federal polls likely to be held on sept .
18 and sense an opportunity to score points . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , broke off his election campaign to clamber into an armored military helicopter and pay a hasty visit to the village of eschenloher which has been cut off from the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber " the citizens should know that we wo n't leave them alone , " stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said after a quick round of the devastated place .
in a sign that garnering sympathy from voters is uppermost in most politician 's minds at this time , stoiber added that his bavarian government had invested millions in flood-prevention and had been " the only state in germany " to do so . stoiber 's government has invested around 670 million euros in flood-prevention systems since the 2002 floods and the csu chief was quick to highlight the benefits .
" there is more water than in the big flood of whitsun 1999 , " stoiber said , " but there is less damage because of our flood control . " german chancellor gerhard schröder , who plans to use a campaign visit in augsburg on thursday to tour the affected regions and get first-hand information , hit back at stoiber in the pages of the münchner merkur on wednesday , crticizing the same flood control methods his former rival was so proud of . " for the last two years , the funds for flood control in bavaria have been cut , " schröder told the paper .
" everyone knows very well the public wants money saved but at the same time one must consider in what areas we must make these savings . " schröder dismissed allegations that he would use the floods to gain political capital , saying : " in such a situation , it is not about party differences , it is only about helping people . " he added that he would be mobilizing emergency services to help the afflicted areas . in a statement timed to support his pledge , defense minister peter struck said some 1,000 soldiers had been deployed to boost flood defenses with another 1,000 on standby . other politicians were also quick to react to the catastrophe .
the cdu and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a likely coalition partner of the conservatives in a future government , called off their planned summit on wednesday saying that the affected regions had priority . meanwhile interior minister otto schily was on the ground visiting the worst hit areas of garmisch-partenkirchen , mühldorf am inn and eschenlohe while foreign minsiter joschka fischer was said to be talking to eu officials in brussels with a view to securing aid . will the floods save schröder agai n ? the event has inevitably stirred memories of the 2002 election campaign when catastrophic floods in eastern germany were largely credited for schröder 's re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröeder talks to a resident in front of her damaged house in grimma , eastern germany .
at the time , schröder - who was badly trailing in the polls - rushed to eastern germany to offer affected residents sympathy and aid worth millions .
television images of the chancellor wading through the flood waters in rubber boots and a green raincoat to visit affected homes and residents is believed to have helped to sway voters , thus ensuring that schröder came up from behind to defeat his conservative challenger edmund stoiber . this time seems no different and germany 's media is already commenting wryly on the political mileage to be extracted from the catastrophe and whether it might save schröder yet again . " bavaria under water .
schröder 's coming , " read the headline in the berliner zeitung on wednesday .
" the elbe river floods dominated talks for weeks and decided the election -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- .
gerhard schröder saved himself in rubber boots into his next term , " the paper said in an editorial .
" one can certainly do politics with water . " bildunterschrift : dw-world 's election cartoonist paolo calleri called his drawing old hand schröder the mass-selling bild was more graphic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.08.2005 car sharing picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car sharing is an idea whose time , many think , has come once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .
they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .
" but they do n't drive .
we need customers who actually want to drive now and then .

franco-german television station arte said it would broadcast the 1946 drama " martin roumagnac " featuring dietrich and her then lover , french actor jean gabin , on thursday .
the french production - the only one to show dietrich and gabin together - was unearthed in the archives of the kirch media empire after it went bankrupt three years ago .
" the film surfaced at kirch during the course of the insolvency hearings and arte bought the rights last year , " the channel 's film programming chief holger stern said .
the movie , which was filmed in french , will be shown in germany in a dubbed version , which also dates from 1946 , and in the original version in france .
the picture features gabin as the bricklayer of the title who meets his ruin when he falls for blanche , played by the smouldering dietrich . dw-world.de berlin plans own ' walk of the stars ' when it comes to film history , berlin is no dilettante .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.08.2005 mulling more video surveillance in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much security is too much ?
video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .

" schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .

dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.08.2005 car sharing picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car sharing is an idea whose time , many think , has come once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .
they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .
" but they do n't drive .
we need customers who actually want to drive now and then .

they are also worried about a plan by the british government to deport hardline islamists to countries where they may face torture or even execution . clarke said the plan would take effect " very quickly .
the next few days . " he said he had an obligation " to stop people coming into this country to get young people , in particular , to behave in the appalling way we saw in july . " part of larger crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scenes at edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
the list is part of a wide-ranging government crackdown on islamic extremist and other groups in the wake of the july 7 suicide bombings , which killed 56 people , and attempted copycat attacks on july 21 . prime minister tony blair warned earlier this month " the rules of the game are changing . " the home office plan - compiled after a two-week consultation with muslim groups and other organizations - applies both to non-british citizens already in the country and those who want to come to britain .
it will be used as a basis for clarke to ban or deport people from britain . the so-called " unacceptable behaviors " include those which : foment , justify or glorify terrorist violence , seek to provoke others to terrorist acts , foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to commit serious criminal acts , or foster hatred which might lead to inter-community violence in britain . the banned views could be aired by writing , producing or distributing material , public speaking or over an internet site .
they could also be delivered by someone in a position of responsibility such as a teacher or a community leader . those given a deportation order in britain have the right to appeal , while anyone banned from entering the country can seek a judicial review . muslims concerned inayat bunglawala , a spokesman for the muslim council of britain , disagreed , arguing the criteria were too vague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims listen to the imam at their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london , friday july 8 , 2005 .
" we are especially concerned that senior islamic scholars will be barred from the uk purely on the basis of media witch hunts orchestrated by pro-israeli elements , " bunglawala said . in addition , the united nations ' special rapporteur on torture , manfred nowak , said britain 's plan to deport firebrand islamists to countries with poor human rights records would expose them to " a real risk " of the death penalty . but clarke responded angrily , saying the un should pay more attention to the rights of the victims . " the human rights of those people who were blown up on the tube in london on july 7 are , to be quite frank , more important than the human rights of the people who committed those acts , " he told the itv news channel . " it is a balance , of course , and i acknowledge that there are real issues that have to be addressed , but i wish the un would look at human rights in the round rather than simply focusing all the time on the terrorist .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art .

almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .
but as the imminent german defeat approached , the nazi commandant of the facility ordered the salt mines and artworks destroyed . allies liberatio n led to the loss of ma n y works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately , no wholesale destruction occurred and the majority of the collection was confiscated by the allied forces which had already begun to bring works of art recovered from various depots to special collection points where a system was set up to find the legal owners . however , not all the artifacts were returned . speaking in berlin on tuesday , löhr said that his new book reopens the debate as to what became of the art that never found its way home and that the revelations were " explosive .

floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .
familiar with the scene , chancellor schröder is already donning his rubber boots . continuing heavy downpours had turned the alpine regions of the southern german state of bavaria and neighboring switzerland and austria on wednesday into a bleak watery landscape . several low-lying areas had been completely submerged , residents had to be rescued by boats and helicopters in many places and tourist hotels were evacuated .
roads and rail lines remained blocked as aid workers and emergency services struggled to shore up dykes and dams with sandbags despite several rivers bursting their banks .

on wednesday , authorities were warning that the danube river could submerge its banks as residents of the towns of passau and regensburg were bracing for the flood waters . politicia n s scramble to offer help the unfolding tragedy has also sent the country 's politicians scrambling to the flood-affected areas .
they are in the midst of an election campaign for federal polls likely to be held on sept .

in a sign that garnering sympathy from voters is uppermost in most politician 's minds at this time , stoiber added that his bavarian government had invested millions in flood-prevention and had been " the only state in germany " to do so . stoiber 's government has invested around 670 million euros in flood-prevention systems since the 2002 floods and the csu chief was quick to highlight the benefits .
" there is more water than in the big flood of whitsun 1999 , " stoiber said , " but there is less damage because of our flood control . " german chancellor gerhard schröder , who plans to use a campaign visit in augsburg on thursday to tour the affected regions and get first-hand information , hit back at stoiber in the pages of the münchner merkur on wednesday , crticizing the same flood control methods his former rival was so proud of . " for the last two years , the funds for flood control in bavaria have been cut , " schröder told the paper .
" everyone knows very well the public wants money saved but at the same time one must consider in what areas we must make these savings . " schröder dismissed allegations that he would use the floods to gain political capital , saying : " in such a situation , it is not about party differences , it is only about helping people . " he added that he would be mobilizing emergency services to help the afflicted areas . in a statement timed to support his pledge , defense minister peter struck said some 1,000 soldiers had been deployed to boost flood defenses with another 1,000 on standby . other politicians were also quick to react to the catastrophe .
the cdu and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a likely coalition partner of the conservatives in a future government , called off their planned summit on wednesday saying that the affected regions had priority . meanwhile interior minister otto schily was on the ground visiting the worst hit areas of garmisch-partenkirchen , mühldorf am inn and eschenlohe while foreign minsiter joschka fischer was said to be talking to eu officials in brussels with a view to securing aid . will the floods save schröder agai n ? the event has inevitably stirred memories of the 2002 election campaign when catastrophic floods in eastern germany were largely credited for schröder 's re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröeder talks to a resident in front of her damaged house in grimma , eastern germany .

china and the eu hope to sort out the textile row beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday . negotiators are scheduled to meet in beijing on thursday to work out a plan to alleviate millions of dollars of chinese textiles that have surpassed import quotas negotiated in june and are now stranded in european ports , chinese and eu officials said .

she does not expect any understanding or compassion , " he said . a shocked nation jessica 's horrific death shocked the country earlier this year .
soon after her body was taken away , police put the parents in jail , as prosecutors began piecing together their case . police later said the parents had kept the girl in a darkened room , with no heating and no access to water or a toilet .
citing investigators , a report in this week 's der spiegel revealed that the father , identified only as burkhard m. tried to set a trap to electrocute the young girl . psychiatrists have since speculated that the parents , who apparently had alcohol problems , suffer from extreme personality problems rooted in their own traumatic experiences as children .
the parents denied having had a hand in their daughter 's death , and portrayed her as difficult child to investigators , according to spiegel . nobody knew bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica 's funeral : germans mourned the little girl who never had any friends during her short life .
the little girl apparently had no friends , having never attended any sort of kindergarten or school .
neighbors said they saw very little of the girl , and only saw her parents go in and out of the apartment . the statements are eerily similar to those given recently by the neighbors of a brandenburg woman suspected by police of giving birth to and then killing nine infants , prompting germany 's largest sunday newspaper to complain about the indifference among germans . " the population looks away , in the country as well as in the big city , " wrote bild am sonntag . in jessica 's case , hamburg school authorities came under attack for not doing more after sending someone to the apartment to find out what was wrong .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .

spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes .

studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .

car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .

dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

the couple face up to 15 years in prison if convicted . notified by the mother of the 7-year-old girl , police turned up at the hamburg apartment in march to find jessica 's skeletal body , weighing just 21 pounds . her parents told police that she had been vomiting , and then fell into a coma after crawling into bed with her father .
an autopsy later revealed she had choked on her own vomit , likely induced by an intestinal obstruction caused by a lack of food . on wednesday , a regional court judge charged the 36-year-old mother and 49-year-old father with murder by neglect , saying they had agreed to let jessica die of hunger . a lawyer for the mother , identified only as marlies sch. told a packed courtroom that she would plead guilty , but not implicate the father , whom he described as a weak-willed man .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art .

almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .

löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.08.2005 car sharing picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car sharing is an idea whose time , many think , has come once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .
they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .

floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .
familiar with the scene , chancellor schröder is already donning his rubber boots . continuing heavy downpours had turned the alpine regions of the southern german state of bavaria and neighboring switzerland and austria on wednesday into a bleak watery landscape . several low-lying areas had been completely submerged , residents had to be rescued by boats and helicopters in many places and tourist hotels were evacuated .
roads and rail lines remained blocked as aid workers and emergency services struggled to shore up dykes and dams with sandbags despite several rivers bursting their banks .
drinking water and electricity were in short supply in some areas following the complete breakdown in public services . bildunterschrift : helpers of the fire department in eschenlohe in bavaria several regions in bavaria such as kempten , augsburg and garmisch-partenkirchen were on red alert after authorities said that water levels had exceeded the catastrophic floods of 1999 , deemed the worst of the century at the time , which hit bavaria . however , in comparison to switzerland and austria , where six people had been killed by tuesday , germany was only counting injured victims of the catastrophe .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .
but as the imminent german defeat approached , the nazi commandant of the facility ordered the salt mines and artworks destroyed . allies liberatio n led to the loss of ma n y works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately , no wholesale destruction occurred and the majority of the collection was confiscated by the allied forces which had already begun to bring works of art recovered from various depots to special collection points where a system was set up to find the legal owners . however , not all the artifacts were returned . speaking in berlin on tuesday , löhr said that his new book reopens the debate as to what became of the art that never found its way home and that the revelations were " explosive . "
löhr suggested that some artworks which hang in museums and collections in berlin have the mark of an original , legal owner somewhere in their history . stole n art u n witti n gly bought all over the world it 's been suggested that after the war , many of the missing works passed through the federal government in bonn and the austrian federal government as well as private collections in both countries while others ended up in the hands of art thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlene von saher points to the painting once owned by her grandfather titled , " the temptation of st. anthony , " in new york .
the painting is part of an extensive collection of old master art that was stolen by the nazis in holland 60 years ago .
löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .

china and the eu hope to sort out the textile row beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday . negotiators are scheduled to meet in beijing on thursday to work out a plan to alleviate millions of dollars of chinese textiles that have surpassed import quotas negotiated in june and are now stranded in european ports , chinese and eu officials said .

on wednesday , authorities were warning that the danube river could submerge its banks as residents of the towns of passau and regensburg were bracing for the flood waters . politicia n s scramble to offer help the unfolding tragedy has also sent the country 's politicians scrambling to the flood-affected areas .

in a sign that garnering sympathy from voters is uppermost in most politician 's minds at this time , stoiber added that his bavarian government had invested millions in flood-prevention and had been " the only state in germany " to do so . stoiber 's government has invested around 670 million euros in flood-prevention systems since the 2002 floods and the csu chief was quick to highlight the benefits .
" there is more water than in the big flood of whitsun 1999 , " stoiber said , " but there is less damage because of our flood control . " german chancellor gerhard schröder , who plans to use a campaign visit in augsburg on thursday to tour the affected regions and get first-hand information , hit back at stoiber in the pages of the münchner merkur on wednesday , crticizing the same flood control methods his former rival was so proud of . " for the last two years , the funds for flood control in bavaria have been cut , " schröder told the paper .
" everyone knows very well the public wants money saved but at the same time one must consider in what areas we must make these savings .

" he added that he would be mobilizing emergency services to help the afflicted areas . in a statement timed to support his pledge , defense minister peter struck said some 1,000 soldiers had been deployed to boost flood defenses with another 1,000 on standby . other politicians were also quick to react to the catastrophe .
the cdu and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a likely coalition partner of the conservatives in a future government , called off their planned summit on wednesday saying that the affected regions had priority . meanwhile interior minister otto schily was on the ground visiting the worst hit areas of garmisch-partenkirchen , mühldorf am inn and eschenlohe while foreign minsiter joschka fischer was said to be talking to eu officials in brussels with a view to securing aid . will the floods save schröder agai n ? the event has inevitably stirred memories of the 2002 election campaign when catastrophic floods in eastern germany were largely credited for schröder 's re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröeder talks to a resident in front of her damaged house in grimma , eastern germany .
at the time , schröder - who was badly trailing in the polls - rushed to eastern germany to offer affected residents sympathy and aid worth millions .
television images of the chancellor wading through the flood waters in rubber boots and a green raincoat to visit affected homes and residents is believed to have helped to sway voters , thus ensuring that schröder came up from behind to defeat his conservative challenger edmund stoiber . this time seems no different and germany 's media is already commenting wryly on the political mileage to be extracted from the catastrophe and whether it might save schröder yet again . " bavaria under water .

floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .
familiar with the scene , chancellor schröder is already donning his rubber boots . continuing heavy downpours had turned the alpine regions of the southern german state of bavaria and neighboring switzerland and austria on wednesday into a bleak watery landscape . several low-lying areas had been completely submerged , residents had to be rescued by boats and helicopters in many places and tourist hotels were evacuated .
roads and rail lines remained blocked as aid workers and emergency services struggled to shore up dykes and dams with sandbags despite several rivers bursting their banks .
drinking water and electricity were in short supply in some areas following the complete breakdown in public services . bildunterschrift : helpers of the fire department in eschenlohe in bavaria several regions in bavaria such as kempten , augsburg and garmisch-partenkirchen were on red alert after authorities said that water levels had exceeded the catastrophic floods of 1999 , deemed the worst of the century at the time , which hit bavaria . however , in comparison to switzerland and austria , where six people had been killed by tuesday , germany was only counting injured victims of the catastrophe .
on wednesday , authorities were warning that the danube river could submerge its banks as residents of the towns of passau and regensburg were bracing for the flood waters . politicia n s scramble to offer help the unfolding tragedy has also sent the country 's politicians scrambling to the flood-affected areas .
they are in the midst of an election campaign for federal polls likely to be held on sept .
18 and sense an opportunity to score points . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , broke off his election campaign to clamber into an armored military helicopter and pay a hasty visit to the village of eschenloher which has been cut off from the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber " the citizens should know that we wo n't leave them alone , " stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said after a quick round of the devastated place .
in a sign that garnering sympathy from voters is uppermost in most politician 's minds at this time , stoiber added that his bavarian government had invested millions in flood-prevention and had been " the only state in germany " to do so . stoiber 's government has invested around 670 million euros in flood-prevention systems since the 2002 floods and the csu chief was quick to highlight the benefits .
" there is more water than in the big flood of whitsun 1999 , " stoiber said , " but there is less damage because of our flood control . " german chancellor gerhard schröder , who plans to use a campaign visit in augsburg on thursday to tour the affected regions and get first-hand information , hit back at stoiber in the pages of the münchner merkur on wednesday , crticizing the same flood control methods his former rival was so proud of . " for the last two years , the funds for flood control in bavaria have been cut , " schröder told the paper .
" everyone knows very well the public wants money saved but at the same time one must consider in what areas we must make these savings . " schröder dismissed allegations that he would use the floods to gain political capital , saying : " in such a situation , it is not about party differences , it is only about helping people . " he added that he would be mobilizing emergency services to help the afflicted areas . in a statement timed to support his pledge , defense minister peter struck said some 1,000 soldiers had been deployed to boost flood defenses with another 1,000 on standby . other politicians were also quick to react to the catastrophe .
the cdu and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a likely coalition partner of the conservatives in a future government , called off their planned summit on wednesday saying that the affected regions had priority . meanwhile interior minister otto schily was on the ground visiting the worst hit areas of garmisch-partenkirchen , mühldorf am inn and eschenlohe while foreign minsiter joschka fischer was said to be talking to eu officials in brussels with a view to securing aid . will the floods save schröder agai n ? the event has inevitably stirred memories of the 2002 election campaign when catastrophic floods in eastern germany were largely credited for schröder 's re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröeder talks to a resident in front of her damaged house in grimma , eastern germany .

they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .
but as the imminent german defeat approached , the nazi commandant of the facility ordered the salt mines and artworks destroyed . allies liberatio n led to the loss of ma n y works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately , no wholesale destruction occurred and the majority of the collection was confiscated by the allied forces which had already begun to bring works of art recovered from various depots to special collection points where a system was set up to find the legal owners . however , not all the artifacts were returned . speaking in berlin on tuesday , löhr said that his new book reopens the debate as to what became of the art that never found its way home and that the revelations were " explosive . "
löhr suggested that some artworks which hang in museums and collections in berlin have the mark of an original , legal owner somewhere in their history . stole n art u n witti n gly bought all over the world it 's been suggested that after the war , many of the missing works passed through the federal government in bonn and the austrian federal government as well as private collections in both countries while others ended up in the hands of art thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlene von saher points to the painting once owned by her grandfather titled , " the temptation of st. anthony , " in new york .
the painting is part of an extensive collection of old master art that was stolen by the nazis in holland 60 years ago .
löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .

löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?

dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?

china and the eu hope to sort out the textile row beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday . negotiators are scheduled to meet in beijing on thursday to work out a plan to alleviate millions of dollars of chinese textiles that have surpassed import quotas negotiated in june and are now stranded in european ports , chinese and eu officials said . " canceling the quotas is what we hope for most and is also the hope of england , germany , sweden , denmark and finland , but it will make other countries unhappy , so it 's not a possible solution , " mei xinyu , a leading analyst at the ministry of commerce told afp . one " measure is to use part of next year 's quota this year , but it is not enough to solve the problem , so a much better idea is to lift the quota by a very large scale . " some 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers and nearly 500,000 blouses produced in china are currently blocked by authorities in european ports , according to the latest figures cited by the french trade ministry . in addition to this , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are also being kept back because they exceed the quotas . rush by eu retailers resulted i n huge orders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the products were ordered by european retailers in rush orders to beat the import restrictions and many contracts explicitly place the burden for losses due to the quotas on the importing side , the beiji n g news said . " many companies were worried that they would not meet demand because of the eu quotas on chinese textiles , so one by one they began to quicken the pace of their import orders , " shen suqin , general manager of the jiangsu xiangsheng textile company , told the paper . the daily said chinese negotiators were expecting a victory in the talks and carried a cartoon with four half naked europeans standing on a dock holding a welcome sign as a chinese ship loaded with clothes is anchored off shore .
" european apparel retailers are facing an embarrassing situation of having no goods because of the european union quotas , " the caption read . europe a n d us worki n g to curb rampa n t imports bildunterschrift : according to the eco n omic daily , chinese textile exports surpassed 50.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.5 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of the year , with textile export value exceeding 8.1 billion euros in each of june and july as the eu and the united states worked to curb the booming trade and protect local industries . chinese textile exports to europe in june alone hit 1.7 billion euros , up 85 percent from the same month in 2004 , coming just as the two sides were working out a deal to cap the surge , the paper said , citing customs statistics . chinese textiles have surged dramatically after a global textile quota system was abolished on jan .
1 as part of world trade organization efforts to liberalize international trade . the surge , however , prompted the eu and the united states to re-implement the quotas provisionally on chinese textile exports in an effort to protect domestic manufacturers . us , chi n a also faili n g to fi n d commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us commerce secretary , donald evans speaks during a press conference in beijing , china , thursday , jan 13 , 2005 .

they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .

" i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .

greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .
" but they do n't drive .
we need customers who actually want to drive now and then .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .
but as the imminent german defeat approached , the nazi commandant of the facility ordered the salt mines and artworks destroyed . allies liberatio n led to the loss of ma n y works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately , no wholesale destruction occurred and the majority of the collection was confiscated by the allied forces which had already begun to bring works of art recovered from various depots to special collection points where a system was set up to find the legal owners . however , not all the artifacts were returned . speaking in berlin on tuesday , löhr said that his new book reopens the debate as to what became of the art that never found its way home and that the revelations were " explosive . "
löhr suggested that some artworks which hang in museums and collections in berlin have the mark of an original , legal owner somewhere in their history . stole n art u n witti n gly bought all over the world it 's been suggested that after the war , many of the missing works passed through the federal government in bonn and the austrian federal government as well as private collections in both countries while others ended up in the hands of art thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlene von saher points to the painting once owned by her grandfather titled , " the temptation of st. anthony , " in new york .
the painting is part of an extensive collection of old master art that was stolen by the nazis in holland 60 years ago .
löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .

floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .
familiar with the scene , chancellor schröder is already donning his rubber boots . continuing heavy downpours had turned the alpine regions of the southern german state of bavaria and neighboring switzerland and austria on wednesday into a bleak watery landscape . several low-lying areas had been completely submerged , residents had to be rescued by boats and helicopters in many places and tourist hotels were evacuated .
roads and rail lines remained blocked as aid workers and emergency services struggled to shore up dykes and dams with sandbags despite several rivers bursting their banks .

china and the eu hope to sort out the textile row beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday . negotiators are scheduled to meet in beijing on thursday to work out a plan to alleviate millions of dollars of chinese textiles that have surpassed import quotas negotiated in june and are now stranded in european ports , chinese and eu officials said . " canceling the quotas is what we hope for most and is also the hope of england , germany , sweden , denmark and finland , but it will make other countries unhappy , so it 's not a possible solution , " mei xinyu , a leading analyst at the ministry of commerce told afp . one " measure is to use part of next year 's quota this year , but it is not enough to solve the problem , so a much better idea is to lift the quota by a very large scale . " some 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers and nearly 500,000 blouses produced in china are currently blocked by authorities in european ports , according to the latest figures cited by the french trade ministry . in addition to this , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are also being kept back because they exceed the quotas . rush by eu retailers resulted i n huge orders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the products were ordered by european retailers in rush orders to beat the import restrictions and many contracts explicitly place the burden for losses due to the quotas on the importing side , the beiji n g news said . " many companies were worried that they would not meet demand because of the eu quotas on chinese textiles , so one by one they began to quicken the pace of their import orders , " shen suqin , general manager of the jiangsu xiangsheng textile company , told the paper . the daily said chinese negotiators were expecting a victory in the talks and carried a cartoon with four half naked europeans standing on a dock holding a welcome sign as a chinese ship loaded with clothes is anchored off shore .
" european apparel retailers are facing an embarrassing situation of having no goods because of the european union quotas , " the caption read . europe a n d us worki n g to curb rampa n t imports bildunterschrift : according to the eco n omic daily , chinese textile exports surpassed 50.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.5 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of the year , with textile export value exceeding 8.1 billion euros in each of june and july as the eu and the united states worked to curb the booming trade and protect local industries . chinese textile exports to europe in june alone hit 1.7 billion euros , up 85 percent from the same month in 2004 , coming just as the two sides were working out a deal to cap the surge , the paper said , citing customs statistics . chinese textiles have surged dramatically after a global textile quota system was abolished on jan .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.08.2005 " there is no global moral view " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research remains a contentious issue in germany in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?
what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?

sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .

in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .

dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .

dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.08.2005 car sharing picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car sharing is an idea whose time , many think , has come once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .
they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .
" but they do n't drive .
we need customers who actually want to drive now and then .

they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd .

" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .
" but they do n't drive .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.08.2005 mulling more video surveillance in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much security is too much ?
video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.08.2005 car sharing picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car sharing is an idea whose time , many think , has come once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .
they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .
" but they do n't drive .
we need customers who actually want to drive now and then .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.08.2005 car sharing picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car sharing is an idea whose time , many think , has come once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .
they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .
" but they do n't drive .
we need customers who actually want to drive now and then .

the couple face up to 15 years in prison if convicted . notified by the mother of the 7-year-old girl , police turned up at the hamburg apartment in march to find jessica 's skeletal body , weighing just 21 pounds . her parents told police that she had been vomiting , and then fell into a coma after crawling into bed with her father .
an autopsy later revealed she had choked on her own vomit , likely induced by an intestinal obstruction caused by a lack of food . on wednesday , a regional court judge charged the 36-year-old mother and 49-year-old father with murder by neglect , saying they had agreed to let jessica die of hunger . a lawyer for the mother , identified only as marlies sch. told a packed courtroom that she would plead guilty , but not implicate the father , whom he described as a weak-willed man . " my client plans to confess her guilt .
she does not expect any understanding or compassion , " he said . a shocked nation jessica 's horrific death shocked the country earlier this year .
soon after her body was taken away , police put the parents in jail , as prosecutors began piecing together their case . police later said the parents had kept the girl in a darkened room , with no heating and no access to water or a toilet .
citing investigators , a report in this week 's der spiegel revealed that the father , identified only as burkhard m. tried to set a trap to electrocute the young girl . psychiatrists have since speculated that the parents , who apparently had alcohol problems , suffer from extreme personality problems rooted in their own traumatic experiences as children .
the parents denied having had a hand in their daughter 's death , and portrayed her as difficult child to investigators , according to spiegel . nobody knew bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica 's funeral : germans mourned the little girl who never had any friends during her short life .
the little girl apparently had no friends , having never attended any sort of kindergarten or school .
neighbors said they saw very little of the girl , and only saw her parents go in and out of the apartment . the statements are eerily similar to those given recently by the neighbors of a brandenburg woman suspected by police of giving birth to and then killing nine infants , prompting germany 's largest sunday newspaper to complain about the indifference among germans . " the population looks away , in the country as well as in the big city , " wrote bild am sonntag . in jessica 's case , hamburg school authorities came under attack for not doing more after sending someone to the apartment to find out what was wrong .
although authorities sent the parents a notice to pay a penalty for not enrolling their child in school , they failed to notify the state 's child protection agency . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police search for more babies after gruesome find police investigating the suspected worst case of infanticide in german postwar history said they were searching wednesday for further possible remains , days after the discovery of nine dead newborns .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art .

almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .

china and the eu hope to sort out the textile row beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday . negotiators are scheduled to meet in beijing on thursday to work out a plan to alleviate millions of dollars of chinese textiles that have surpassed import quotas negotiated in june and are now stranded in european ports , chinese and eu officials said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.08.2005 " there is no global moral view " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research remains a contentious issue in germany in the age of gene modification and biotechnology can human beings retain their dignity ?
what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

they are also worried about a plan by the british government to deport hardline islamists to countries where they may face torture or even execution . clarke said the plan would take effect " very quickly .
the next few days . " he said he had an obligation " to stop people coming into this country to get young people , in particular , to behave in the appalling way we saw in july . " part of larger crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scenes at edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
the list is part of a wide-ranging government crackdown on islamic extremist and other groups in the wake of the july 7 suicide bombings , which killed 56 people , and attempted copycat attacks on july 21 . prime minister tony blair warned earlier this month " the rules of the game are changing . " the home office plan - compiled after a two-week consultation with muslim groups and other organizations - applies both to non-british citizens already in the country and those who want to come to britain .
it will be used as a basis for clarke to ban or deport people from britain . the so-called " unacceptable behaviors " include those which : foment , justify or glorify terrorist violence , seek to provoke others to terrorist acts , foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to commit serious criminal acts , or foster hatred which might lead to inter-community violence in britain . the banned views could be aired by writing , producing or distributing material , public speaking or over an internet site .
they could also be delivered by someone in a position of responsibility such as a teacher or a community leader . those given a deportation order in britain have the right to appeal , while anyone banned from entering the country can seek a judicial review . muslims concerned inayat bunglawala , a spokesman for the muslim council of britain , disagreed , arguing the criteria were too vague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims listen to the imam at their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london , friday july 8 , 2005 .
" we are especially concerned that senior islamic scholars will be barred from the uk purely on the basis of media witch hunts orchestrated by pro-israeli elements , " bunglawala said . in addition , the united nations ' special rapporteur on torture , manfred nowak , said britain 's plan to deport firebrand islamists to countries with poor human rights records would expose them to " a real risk " of the death penalty . but clarke responded angrily , saying the un should pay more attention to the rights of the victims . " the human rights of those people who were blown up on the tube in london on july 7 are , to be quite frank , more important than the human rights of the people who committed those acts , " he told the itv news channel . " it is a balance , of course , and i acknowledge that there are real issues that have to be addressed , but i wish the un would look at human rights in the round rather than simply focusing all the time on the terrorist .

they are also worried about a plan by the british government to deport hardline islamists to countries where they may face torture or even execution . clarke said the plan would take effect " very quickly .
the next few days . " he said he had an obligation " to stop people coming into this country to get young people , in particular , to behave in the appalling way we saw in july . " part of larger crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scenes at edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
the list is part of a wide-ranging government crackdown on islamic extremist and other groups in the wake of the july 7 suicide bombings , which killed 56 people , and attempted copycat attacks on july 21 . prime minister tony blair warned earlier this month " the rules of the game are changing . " the home office plan - compiled after a two-week consultation with muslim groups and other organizations - applies both to non-british citizens already in the country and those who want to come to britain .
it will be used as a basis for clarke to ban or deport people from britain . the so-called " unacceptable behaviors " include those which : foment , justify or glorify terrorist violence , seek to provoke others to terrorist acts , foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to commit serious criminal acts , or foster hatred which might lead to inter-community violence in britain . the banned views could be aired by writing , producing or distributing material , public speaking or over an internet site .
they could also be delivered by someone in a position of responsibility such as a teacher or a community leader . those given a deportation order in britain have the right to appeal , while anyone banned from entering the country can seek a judicial review . muslims concerned inayat bunglawala , a spokesman for the muslim council of britain , disagreed , arguing the criteria were too vague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims listen to the imam at their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london , friday july 8 , 2005 .
" we are especially concerned that senior islamic scholars will be barred from the uk purely on the basis of media witch hunts orchestrated by pro-israeli elements , " bunglawala said . in addition , the united nations ' special rapporteur on torture , manfred nowak , said britain 's plan to deport firebrand islamists to countries with poor human rights records would expose them to " a real risk " of the death penalty . but clarke responded angrily , saying the un should pay more attention to the rights of the victims . " the human rights of those people who were blown up on the tube in london on july 7 are , to be quite frank , more important than the human rights of the people who committed those acts , " he told the itv news channel . " it is a balance , of course , and i acknowledge that there are real issues that have to be addressed , but i wish the un would look at human rights in the round rather than simply focusing all the time on the terrorist .

they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .

" car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .

you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .

it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes .

they are also worried about a plan by the british government to deport hardline islamists to countries where they may face torture or even execution . clarke said the plan would take effect " very quickly .
the next few days . " he said he had an obligation " to stop people coming into this country to get young people , in particular , to behave in the appalling way we saw in july . " part of larger crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scenes at edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
the list is part of a wide-ranging government crackdown on islamic extremist and other groups in the wake of the july 7 suicide bombings , which killed 56 people , and attempted copycat attacks on july 21 . prime minister tony blair warned earlier this month " the rules of the game are changing . " the home office plan - compiled after a two-week consultation with muslim groups and other organizations - applies both to non-british citizens already in the country and those who want to come to britain .
it will be used as a basis for clarke to ban or deport people from britain . the so-called " unacceptable behaviors " include those which : foment , justify or glorify terrorist violence , seek to provoke others to terrorist acts , foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to commit serious criminal acts , or foster hatred which might lead to inter-community violence in britain . the banned views could be aired by writing , producing or distributing material , public speaking or over an internet site .
they could also be delivered by someone in a position of responsibility such as a teacher or a community leader . those given a deportation order in britain have the right to appeal , while anyone banned from entering the country can seek a judicial review . muslims concerned inayat bunglawala , a spokesman for the muslim council of britain , disagreed , arguing the criteria were too vague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims listen to the imam at their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london , friday july 8 , 2005 .
" we are especially concerned that senior islamic scholars will be barred from the uk purely on the basis of media witch hunts orchestrated by pro-israeli elements , " bunglawala said . in addition , the united nations ' special rapporteur on torture , manfred nowak , said britain 's plan to deport firebrand islamists to countries with poor human rights records would expose them to " a real risk " of the death penalty . but clarke responded angrily , saying the un should pay more attention to the rights of the victims . " the human rights of those people who were blown up on the tube in london on july 7 are , to be quite frank , more important than the human rights of the people who committed those acts , " he told the itv news channel . " it is a balance , of course , and i acknowledge that there are real issues that have to be addressed , but i wish the un would look at human rights in the round rather than simply focusing all the time on the terrorist .

china and the eu hope to sort out the textile row beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday . negotiators are scheduled to meet in beijing on thursday to work out a plan to alleviate millions of dollars of chinese textiles that have surpassed import quotas negotiated in june and are now stranded in european ports , chinese and eu officials said . " canceling the quotas is what we hope for most and is also the hope of england , germany , sweden , denmark and finland , but it will make other countries unhappy , so it 's not a possible solution , " mei xinyu , a leading analyst at the ministry of commerce told afp . one " measure is to use part of next year 's quota this year , but it is not enough to solve the problem , so a much better idea is to lift the quota by a very large scale . " some 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers and nearly 500,000 blouses produced in china are currently blocked by authorities in european ports , according to the latest figures cited by the french trade ministry . in addition to this , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are also being kept back because they exceed the quotas . rush by eu retailers resulted i n huge orders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the products were ordered by european retailers in rush orders to beat the import restrictions and many contracts explicitly place the burden for losses due to the quotas on the importing side , the beiji n g news said . " many companies were worried that they would not meet demand because of the eu quotas on chinese textiles , so one by one they began to quicken the pace of their import orders , " shen suqin , general manager of the jiangsu xiangsheng textile company , told the paper . the daily said chinese negotiators were expecting a victory in the talks and carried a cartoon with four half naked europeans standing on a dock holding a welcome sign as a chinese ship loaded with clothes is anchored off shore .
" european apparel retailers are facing an embarrassing situation of having no goods because of the european union quotas , " the caption read . europe a n d us worki n g to curb rampa n t imports bildunterschrift : according to the eco n omic daily , chinese textile exports surpassed 50.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.5 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of the year , with textile export value exceeding 8.1 billion euros in each of june and july as the eu and the united states worked to curb the booming trade and protect local industries . chinese textile exports to europe in june alone hit 1.7 billion euros , up 85 percent from the same month in 2004 , coming just as the two sides were working out a deal to cap the surge , the paper said , citing customs statistics . chinese textiles have surged dramatically after a global textile quota system was abolished on jan .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .
he is prese n tly a member of germa n y 's n atio n al ethics cou n cil .
dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

" canceling the quotas is what we hope for most and is also the hope of england , germany , sweden , denmark and finland , but it will make other countries unhappy , so it 's not a possible solution , " mei xinyu , a leading analyst at the ministry of commerce told afp . one " measure is to use part of next year 's quota this year , but it is not enough to solve the problem , so a much better idea is to lift the quota by a very large scale . " some 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers and nearly 500,000 blouses produced in china are currently blocked by authorities in european ports , according to the latest figures cited by the french trade ministry . in addition to this , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are also being kept back because they exceed the quotas . rush by eu retailers resulted i n huge orders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the products were ordered by european retailers in rush orders to beat the import restrictions and many contracts explicitly place the burden for losses due to the quotas on the importing side , the beiji n g news said . " many companies were worried that they would not meet demand because of the eu quotas on chinese textiles , so one by one they began to quicken the pace of their import orders , " shen suqin , general manager of the jiangsu xiangsheng textile company , told the paper . the daily said chinese negotiators were expecting a victory in the talks and carried a cartoon with four half naked europeans standing on a dock holding a welcome sign as a chinese ship loaded with clothes is anchored off shore .
" european apparel retailers are facing an embarrassing situation of having no goods because of the european union quotas , " the caption read . europe a n d us worki n g to curb rampa n t imports bildunterschrift : according to the eco n omic daily , chinese textile exports surpassed 50.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.5 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of the year , with textile export value exceeding 8.1 billion euros in each of june and july as the eu and the united states worked to curb the booming trade and protect local industries . chinese textile exports to europe in june alone hit 1.7 billion euros , up 85 percent from the same month in 2004 , coming just as the two sides were working out a deal to cap the surge , the paper said , citing customs statistics . chinese textiles have surged dramatically after a global textile quota system was abolished on jan .
1 as part of world trade organization efforts to liberalize international trade . the surge , however , prompted the eu and the united states to re-implement the quotas provisionally on chinese textile exports in an effort to protect domestic manufacturers . us , chi n a also faili n g to fi n d commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us commerce secretary , donald evans speaks during a press conference in beijing , china , thursday , jan 13 , 2005 .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .
but as the imminent german defeat approached , the nazi commandant of the facility ordered the salt mines and artworks destroyed . allies liberatio n led to the loss of ma n y works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately , no wholesale destruction occurred and the majority of the collection was confiscated by the allied forces which had already begun to bring works of art recovered from various depots to special collection points where a system was set up to find the legal owners . however , not all the artifacts were returned . speaking in berlin on tuesday , löhr said that his new book reopens the debate as to what became of the art that never found its way home and that the revelations were " explosive . "
löhr suggested that some artworks which hang in museums and collections in berlin have the mark of an original , legal owner somewhere in their history . stole n art u n witti n gly bought all over the world it 's been suggested that after the war , many of the missing works passed through the federal government in bonn and the austrian federal government as well as private collections in both countries while others ended up in the hands of art thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlene von saher points to the painting once owned by her grandfather titled , " the temptation of st. anthony , " in new york .
the painting is part of an extensive collection of old master art that was stolen by the nazis in holland 60 years ago .
löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .

" despite the claims of the europeans , it was not iran that violated the paris agreement , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told the state news agency irna .
he was referring to a november 2004 deal under which iran agreed to freeze its nuclear fuel cycle activities - which it insists are only aimed at power generation but which could potentially be diverted to making a bomb . " the europeans are to blame for unilaterally interpreting and violating the paris agreement , " asefi said , repeating iran 's contention that it has the right under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- to produce its own nuclear fuel . " the europeans ignored iran 's rights . " eu-3 still wa n t talks despite ca n celed meeti n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe douste-blazy with german counterpart joschka fischer .

" we are suspending the negotiations , " he told france i n ter radio .
" but at the same time , we think it is still possible to talk to them ...
there is no reason to close the door on iran . " " until the last minute , we hope to be able to talk to them , " douste-blazy said .

" despite the claims of the europeans , it was not iran that violated the paris agreement , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told the state news agency irna .
he was referring to a november 2004 deal under which iran agreed to freeze its nuclear fuel cycle activities - which it insists are only aimed at power generation but which could potentially be diverted to making a bomb . " the europeans are to blame for unilaterally interpreting and violating the paris agreement , " asefi said , repeating iran 's contention that it has the right under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- to produce its own nuclear fuel .

they are also worried about a plan by the british government to deport hardline islamists to countries where they may face torture or even execution . clarke said the plan would take effect " very quickly .
the next few days . " he said he had an obligation " to stop people coming into this country to get young people , in particular , to behave in the appalling way we saw in july . " part of larger crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scenes at edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
the list is part of a wide-ranging government crackdown on islamic extremist and other groups in the wake of the july 7 suicide bombings , which killed 56 people , and attempted copycat attacks on july 21 . prime minister tony blair warned earlier this month " the rules of the game are changing . " the home office plan - compiled after a two-week consultation with muslim groups and other organizations - applies both to non-british citizens already in the country and those who want to come to britain .
it will be used as a basis for clarke to ban or deport people from britain . the so-called " unacceptable behaviors " include those which : foment , justify or glorify terrorist violence , seek to provoke others to terrorist acts , foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to commit serious criminal acts , or foster hatred which might lead to inter-community violence in britain . the banned views could be aired by writing , producing or distributing material , public speaking or over an internet site .
they could also be delivered by someone in a position of responsibility such as a teacher or a community leader . those given a deportation order in britain have the right to appeal , while anyone banned from entering the country can seek a judicial review . muslims concerned inayat bunglawala , a spokesman for the muslim council of britain , disagreed , arguing the criteria were too vague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims listen to the imam at their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london , friday july 8 , 2005 .
" we are especially concerned that senior islamic scholars will be barred from the uk purely on the basis of media witch hunts orchestrated by pro-israeli elements , " bunglawala said . in addition , the united nations ' special rapporteur on torture , manfred nowak , said britain 's plan to deport firebrand islamists to countries with poor human rights records would expose them to " a real risk " of the death penalty . but clarke responded angrily , saying the un should pay more attention to the rights of the victims . " the human rights of those people who were blown up on the tube in london on july 7 are , to be quite frank , more important than the human rights of the people who committed those acts , " he told the itv news channel . " it is a balance , of course , and i acknowledge that there are real issues that have to be addressed , but i wish the un would look at human rights in the round rather than simply focusing all the time on the terrorist .

china and the eu hope to sort out the textile row beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday . negotiators are scheduled to meet in beijing on thursday to work out a plan to alleviate millions of dollars of chinese textiles that have surpassed import quotas negotiated in june and are now stranded in european ports , chinese and eu officials said . " canceling the quotas is what we hope for most and is also the hope of england , germany , sweden , denmark and finland , but it will make other countries unhappy , so it 's not a possible solution , " mei xinyu , a leading analyst at the ministry of commerce told afp . one " measure is to use part of next year 's quota this year , but it is not enough to solve the problem , so a much better idea is to lift the quota by a very large scale . " some 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers and nearly 500,000 blouses produced in china are currently blocked by authorities in european ports , according to the latest figures cited by the french trade ministry . in addition to this , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are also being kept back because they exceed the quotas . rush by eu retailers resulted i n huge orders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the products were ordered by european retailers in rush orders to beat the import restrictions and many contracts explicitly place the burden for losses due to the quotas on the importing side , the beiji n g news said . " many companies were worried that they would not meet demand because of the eu quotas on chinese textiles , so one by one they began to quicken the pace of their import orders , " shen suqin , general manager of the jiangsu xiangsheng textile company , told the paper . the daily said chinese negotiators were expecting a victory in the talks and carried a cartoon with four half naked europeans standing on a dock holding a welcome sign as a chinese ship loaded with clothes is anchored off shore .
" european apparel retailers are facing an embarrassing situation of having no goods because of the european union quotas , " the caption read . europe a n d us worki n g to curb rampa n t imports bildunterschrift : according to the eco n omic daily , chinese textile exports surpassed 50.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.5 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of the year , with textile export value exceeding 8.1 billion euros in each of june and july as the eu and the united states worked to curb the booming trade and protect local industries . chinese textile exports to europe in june alone hit 1.7 billion euros , up 85 percent from the same month in 2004 , coming just as the two sides were working out a deal to cap the surge , the paper said , citing customs statistics . chinese textiles have surged dramatically after a global textile quota system was abolished on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.08.2005 car sharing picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car sharing is an idea whose time , many think , has come once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .
they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .
but as the imminent german defeat approached , the nazi commandant of the facility ordered the salt mines and artworks destroyed . allies liberatio n led to the loss of ma n y works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately , no wholesale destruction occurred and the majority of the collection was confiscated by the allied forces which had already begun to bring works of art recovered from various depots to special collection points where a system was set up to find the legal owners . however , not all the artifacts were returned . speaking in berlin on tuesday , löhr said that his new book reopens the debate as to what became of the art that never found its way home and that the revelations were " explosive . "
löhr suggested that some artworks which hang in museums and collections in berlin have the mark of an original , legal owner somewhere in their history . stole n art u n witti n gly bought all over the world it 's been suggested that after the war , many of the missing works passed through the federal government in bonn and the austrian federal government as well as private collections in both countries while others ended up in the hands of art thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlene von saher points to the painting once owned by her grandfather titled , " the temptation of st. anthony , " in new york .
the painting is part of an extensive collection of old master art that was stolen by the nazis in holland 60 years ago .
löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.08.2005 car sharing picks up speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car sharing is an idea whose time , many think , has come once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .
they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .

floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .
familiar with the scene , chancellor schröder is already donning his rubber boots . continuing heavy downpours had turned the alpine regions of the southern german state of bavaria and neighboring switzerland and austria on wednesday into a bleak watery landscape . several low-lying areas had been completely submerged , residents had to be rescued by boats and helicopters in many places and tourist hotels were evacuated .
roads and rail lines remained blocked as aid workers and emergency services struggled to shore up dykes and dams with sandbags despite several rivers bursting their banks .
drinking water and electricity were in short supply in some areas following the complete breakdown in public services . bildunterschrift : helpers of the fire department in eschenlohe in bavaria several regions in bavaria such as kempten , augsburg and garmisch-partenkirchen were on red alert after authorities said that water levels had exceeded the catastrophic floods of 1999 , deemed the worst of the century at the time , which hit bavaria . however , in comparison to switzerland and austria , where six people had been killed by tuesday , germany was only counting injured victims of the catastrophe .
on wednesday , authorities were warning that the danube river could submerge its banks as residents of the towns of passau and regensburg were bracing for the flood waters . politicia n s scramble to offer help the unfolding tragedy has also sent the country 's politicians scrambling to the flood-affected areas .
they are in the midst of an election campaign for federal polls likely to be held on sept .
18 and sense an opportunity to score points . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , broke off his election campaign to clamber into an armored military helicopter and pay a hasty visit to the village of eschenloher which has been cut off from the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber " the citizens should know that we wo n't leave them alone , " stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said after a quick round of the devastated place .
in a sign that garnering sympathy from voters is uppermost in most politician 's minds at this time , stoiber added that his bavarian government had invested millions in flood-prevention and had been " the only state in germany " to do so . stoiber 's government has invested around 670 million euros in flood-prevention systems since the 2002 floods and the csu chief was quick to highlight the benefits .
" there is more water than in the big flood of whitsun 1999 , " stoiber said , " but there is less damage because of our flood control . " german chancellor gerhard schröder , who plans to use a campaign visit in augsburg on thursday to tour the affected regions and get first-hand information , hit back at stoiber in the pages of the münchner merkur on wednesday , crticizing the same flood control methods his former rival was so proud of . " for the last two years , the funds for flood control in bavaria have been cut , " schröder told the paper .
" everyone knows very well the public wants money saved but at the same time one must consider in what areas we must make these savings . " schröder dismissed allegations that he would use the floods to gain political capital , saying : " in such a situation , it is not about party differences , it is only about helping people . " he added that he would be mobilizing emergency services to help the afflicted areas . in a statement timed to support his pledge , defense minister peter struck said some 1,000 soldiers had been deployed to boost flood defenses with another 1,000 on standby . other politicians were also quick to react to the catastrophe .
the cdu and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a likely coalition partner of the conservatives in a future government , called off their planned summit on wednesday saying that the affected regions had priority . meanwhile interior minister otto schily was on the ground visiting the worst hit areas of garmisch-partenkirchen , mühldorf am inn and eschenlohe while foreign minsiter joschka fischer was said to be talking to eu officials in brussels with a view to securing aid . will the floods save schröder agai n ? the event has inevitably stirred memories of the 2002 election campaign when catastrophic floods in eastern germany were largely credited for schröder 's re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröeder talks to a resident in front of her damaged house in grimma , eastern germany .
at the time , schröder - who was badly trailing in the polls - rushed to eastern germany to offer affected residents sympathy and aid worth millions .
television images of the chancellor wading through the flood waters in rubber boots and a green raincoat to visit affected homes and residents is believed to have helped to sway voters , thus ensuring that schröder came up from behind to defeat his conservative challenger edmund stoiber . this time seems no different and germany 's media is already commenting wryly on the political mileage to be extracted from the catastrophe and whether it might save schröder yet again .

floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .
familiar with the scene , chancellor schröder is already donning his rubber boots . continuing heavy downpours had turned the alpine regions of the southern german state of bavaria and neighboring switzerland and austria on wednesday into a bleak watery landscape . several low-lying areas had been completely submerged , residents had to be rescued by boats and helicopters in many places and tourist hotels were evacuated .
roads and rail lines remained blocked as aid workers and emergency services struggled to shore up dykes and dams with sandbags despite several rivers bursting their banks .
drinking water and electricity were in short supply in some areas following the complete breakdown in public services . bildunterschrift : helpers of the fire department in eschenlohe in bavaria several regions in bavaria such as kempten , augsburg and garmisch-partenkirchen were on red alert after authorities said that water levels had exceeded the catastrophic floods of 1999 , deemed the worst of the century at the time , which hit bavaria . however , in comparison to switzerland and austria , where six people had been killed by tuesday , germany was only counting injured victims of the catastrophe .
on wednesday , authorities were warning that the danube river could submerge its banks as residents of the towns of passau and regensburg were bracing for the flood waters . politicia n s scramble to offer help the unfolding tragedy has also sent the country 's politicians scrambling to the flood-affected areas .
they are in the midst of an election campaign for federal polls likely to be held on sept .
18 and sense an opportunity to score points . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , broke off his election campaign to clamber into an armored military helicopter and pay a hasty visit to the village of eschenloher which has been cut off from the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber " the citizens should know that we wo n't leave them alone , " stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said after a quick round of the devastated place .
in a sign that garnering sympathy from voters is uppermost in most politician 's minds at this time , stoiber added that his bavarian government had invested millions in flood-prevention and had been " the only state in germany " to do so . stoiber 's government has invested around 670 million euros in flood-prevention systems since the 2002 floods and the csu chief was quick to highlight the benefits .
" there is more water than in the big flood of whitsun 1999 , " stoiber said , " but there is less damage because of our flood control . " german chancellor gerhard schröder , who plans to use a campaign visit in augsburg on thursday to tour the affected regions and get first-hand information , hit back at stoiber in the pages of the münchner merkur on wednesday , crticizing the same flood control methods his former rival was so proud of . " for the last two years , the funds for flood control in bavaria have been cut , " schröder told the paper .
" everyone knows very well the public wants money saved but at the same time one must consider in what areas we must make these savings . " schröder dismissed allegations that he would use the floods to gain political capital , saying : " in such a situation , it is not about party differences , it is only about helping people . " he added that he would be mobilizing emergency services to help the afflicted areas . in a statement timed to support his pledge , defense minister peter struck said some 1,000 soldiers had been deployed to boost flood defenses with another 1,000 on standby . other politicians were also quick to react to the catastrophe .
the cdu and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a likely coalition partner of the conservatives in a future government , called off their planned summit on wednesday saying that the affected regions had priority . meanwhile interior minister otto schily was on the ground visiting the worst hit areas of garmisch-partenkirchen , mühldorf am inn and eschenlohe while foreign minsiter joschka fischer was said to be talking to eu officials in brussels with a view to securing aid . will the floods save schröder agai n ? the event has inevitably stirred memories of the 2002 election campaign when catastrophic floods in eastern germany were largely credited for schröder 's re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröeder talks to a resident in front of her damaged house in grimma , eastern germany .
at the time , schröder - who was badly trailing in the polls - rushed to eastern germany to offer affected residents sympathy and aid worth millions .
television images of the chancellor wading through the flood waters in rubber boots and a green raincoat to visit affected homes and residents is believed to have helped to sway voters , thus ensuring that schröder came up from behind to defeat his conservative challenger edmund stoiber . this time seems no different and germany 's media is already commenting wryly on the political mileage to be extracted from the catastrophe and whether it might save schröder yet again . " bavaria under water .
schröder 's coming , " read the headline in the berliner zeitung on wednesday .
" the elbe river floods dominated talks for weeks and decided the election -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- .
gerhard schröder saved himself in rubber boots into his next term , " the paper said in an editorial .
" one can certainly do politics with water . " bildunterschrift : dw-world 's election cartoonist paolo calleri called his drawing old hand schröder the mass-selling bild was more graphic .
it splashed a picture of schröder looking heavenwards on its front page and an election poster of his current conservative challenger angela merkel submerged in the flood waters with the headline " the floods are here again !

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .
but as the imminent german defeat approached , the nazi commandant of the facility ordered the salt mines and artworks destroyed . allies liberatio n led to the loss of ma n y works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately , no wholesale destruction occurred and the majority of the collection was confiscated by the allied forces which had already begun to bring works of art recovered from various depots to special collection points where a system was set up to find the legal owners . however , not all the artifacts were returned . speaking in berlin on tuesday , löhr said that his new book reopens the debate as to what became of the art that never found its way home and that the revelations were " explosive . "
löhr suggested that some artworks which hang in museums and collections in berlin have the mark of an original , legal owner somewhere in their history . stole n art u n witti n gly bought all over the world it 's been suggested that after the war , many of the missing works passed through the federal government in bonn and the austrian federal government as well as private collections in both countries while others ended up in the hands of art thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlene von saher points to the painting once owned by her grandfather titled , " the temptation of st. anthony , " in new york .
the painting is part of an extensive collection of old master art that was stolen by the nazis in holland 60 years ago .
löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .

citing investigators , a report in this week 's der spiegel revealed that the father , identified only as burkhard m. tried to set a trap to electrocute the young girl . psychiatrists have since speculated that the parents , who apparently had alcohol problems , suffer from extreme personality problems rooted in their own traumatic experiences as children .
the parents denied having had a hand in their daughter 's death , and portrayed her as difficult child to investigators , according to spiegel . nobody knew bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica 's funeral : germans mourned the little girl who never had any friends during her short life .
the little girl apparently had no friends , having never attended any sort of kindergarten or school .
neighbors said they saw very little of the girl , and only saw her parents go in and out of the apartment . the statements are eerily similar to those given recently by the neighbors of a brandenburg woman suspected by police of giving birth to and then killing nine infants , prompting germany 's largest sunday newspaper to complain about the indifference among germans . " the population looks away , in the country as well as in the big city , " wrote bild am sonntag . in jessica 's case , hamburg school authorities came under attack for not doing more after sending someone to the apartment to find out what was wrong .
although authorities sent the parents a notice to pay a penalty for not enrolling their child in school , they failed to notify the state 's child protection agency . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police search for more babies after gruesome find police investigating the suspected worst case of infanticide in german postwar history said they were searching wednesday for further possible remains , days after the discovery of nine dead newborns .

they want the convenience of a car , but less hassle and expense . helen groumas , a 36-year-old professional in cologne , likes not having a car .
she avoids gasoline bills , parking headaches and repair costs .
the city 's public transportation system allows her to easily commute to her job in bonn .
but there are times when a car would come in handy , such as for a shopping trip to ikea . not relishing the thought of schlepping a bookcase on the streetcar , she picks up the phone , calls the car sharing service she 's a member of , and reserves some wheels for the afternoon . " i 'll say i want a car in half an hour , from 11:30 to 1:30 , " she said .
" they 'll check if one 's available , which it usually is , and i walk down the block to pick it up . " a few minutes from her apartment door , her car sharing company , cambio , has a small lot with several cars usually parked on it .
groumas opens a lockbox with a card she has , punches in a code number , and grabs the keys to one of the cars there .
thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .
right now , some 80,000 people use car sharing services in more than 250 municipalities across the country .
only switzerland , where the car-sharing movement began , reports higher rates of usage . " you do without your own car , but you always have a car at your disposal , " said martin stutzbach , director of bcs association .
" one advantage to that is price transparency , since you always know exactly how much it 's going to cost to drive .
if you do n't want the costs , you do n't call the car sharing company .
with your own car , you have the expense even if your car is just sitting there . " in berlin , a member of greenwheels , germany 's oldest car sharing company , pays three euros -lrb- $ 3.65 -rrb- an hour for a compact car and 10 cents per kilometer driven .
if the client checked the car out for three hours and drove 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- , the total bill would come to 13 euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " car sharing used to be a very alternative kind of idea and was marketed as such , " said birger holm , a director with greenwheels in berlin .
" but now we focus on the cost-savings aspect and not just on the environmental theme since most clients want to save money . " filli n g the gap car sharing works particularly well in germany because of the extensive and reliable public transportation networks in most german cities .
it 's not meant to be the primary form of transport , but part of a larger urban transportation strategy that can fill the gap between private car ownership and buses and subways .
some companies are setting up partnerships with local transportation networks and businesses .
greenwheels will drop the monthly fee if a customer has an annual subscription for the bus and train system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates point out that car sharing cuts down on traffic snarls in cities and reduces pollution to some degree , although actual statistics are not available .
studies suggest that one shared car replaces between four and ten private cars .
the european union , in a report released in january , estimated that half a million private vehicles could be replaced by car sharing . one of the main criticisms leveled at the concept is that of convenience - of stepping out of your front door and hopping into a car in minutes .
car sharing companies are quick to point out that , especially in larger cities , the network of parking lots where cars can be " checked out " is dense and there is usually no waiting time .
there are 50 check-out stations in berlin and greenwheels plans on doubling that in the near future . " it 's often a question of : ' do i have to walk 100 meters -lrb- about 100 yards -rrb- to the right or 500 meters to the left in order to pick up my car ? " '
stutzbach said . car sharing and germany may seem a natural fit due to germans ' traditional concern for the environment .
this is a country , after all , in which you can be fined for not separating your trash for recycling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but in fact , due to congestion problems and advances in technology , countries around the globe not considered particularly " green " are investigating car sharing - in southern europe , asia , and even car-crazed north america .
shell oil has launched a car-sharing division and currently operates in 20 german cities . niche sector whereas it 's an industry that is in its teenage years in europe ; in the us , it 's not yet out of the toddler stage .
many analysts wonder if it will ever completely enter the mainstream or remain more of a " boutique " industry in some cities among certain environmentally conscious consumers . " i 'm very sure that it will remain a niche sector , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center for automotive research in gelsenkirchen . " car sharing is more of an industry built on ideals , " he said , but added that it lacks the orientation to grow into a major player . indeed , the business history of car sharing has its share of unhappy endings and over the past 15 years , more car-sharing projects have ended in failure than in success .
in 2000 , berlin 's greenwheels , then known as stattauto , almost went under .
it was then bought in october by the netherlands ' biggest car-sharing firm .
the berlin operation is still cutting corners , recently shutting its walk-in office and moving all customer service functions online in an attempt to cut overhead .
it has yet to make a profit . that is one of the reasons the company have refocused its marketing campaign , aiming at urban professionals instead of just the beard-and-birkenstock crowd . " the traditional " greens " are very welcome and we like that they spread the word , " greenwheels ' holm said .

thirty minutes after she made her reservation , she 's behind the wheel . " it works really well , " she said .
" you always have a car in tip-top shape when you need it . " bildunterschrift : car sharing in hanover car sharing is nothing new ; the concept has been popular with environmentalists since the mid 1980s .
but as gasoline prices continue to climb and cities grow more congested , car sharing is becoming an attractive alternative to car ownership for increasing numbers of people , especially in germany . healthy growth bcs , a federal umbrella group for car sharing companies , reports growth rates of around 10 percent annually over the last decade .

floods in bavaria have caused chaos and destruction and galvanized politicians , in the thick of an election campaign , into action .
familiar with the scene , chancellor schröder is already donning his rubber boots . continuing heavy downpours had turned the alpine regions of the southern german state of bavaria and neighboring switzerland and austria on wednesday into a bleak watery landscape . several low-lying areas had been completely submerged , residents had to be rescued by boats and helicopters in many places and tourist hotels were evacuated .
roads and rail lines remained blocked as aid workers and emergency services struggled to shore up dykes and dams with sandbags despite several rivers bursting their banks .
drinking water and electricity were in short supply in some areas following the complete breakdown in public services . bildunterschrift : helpers of the fire department in eschenlohe in bavaria several regions in bavaria such as kempten , augsburg and garmisch-partenkirchen were on red alert after authorities said that water levels had exceeded the catastrophic floods of 1999 , deemed the worst of the century at the time , which hit bavaria . however , in comparison to switzerland and austria , where six people had been killed by tuesday , germany was only counting injured victims of the catastrophe .
on wednesday , authorities were warning that the danube river could submerge its banks as residents of the towns of passau and regensburg were bracing for the flood waters . politicia n s scramble to offer help the unfolding tragedy has also sent the country 's politicians scrambling to the flood-affected areas .
they are in the midst of an election campaign for federal polls likely to be held on sept .
18 and sense an opportunity to score points . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and leader of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister party of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , broke off his election campaign to clamber into an armored military helicopter and pay a hasty visit to the village of eschenloher which has been cut off from the outside world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber " the citizens should know that we wo n't leave them alone , " stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said after a quick round of the devastated place .
in a sign that garnering sympathy from voters is uppermost in most politician 's minds at this time , stoiber added that his bavarian government had invested millions in flood-prevention and had been " the only state in germany " to do so . stoiber 's government has invested around 670 million euros in flood-prevention systems since the 2002 floods and the csu chief was quick to highlight the benefits .
" there is more water than in the big flood of whitsun 1999 , " stoiber said , " but there is less damage because of our flood control . " german chancellor gerhard schröder , who plans to use a campaign visit in augsburg on thursday to tour the affected regions and get first-hand information , hit back at stoiber in the pages of the münchner merkur on wednesday , crticizing the same flood control methods his former rival was so proud of . " for the last two years , the funds for flood control in bavaria have been cut , " schröder told the paper .
" everyone knows very well the public wants money saved but at the same time one must consider in what areas we must make these savings . " schröder dismissed allegations that he would use the floods to gain political capital , saying : " in such a situation , it is not about party differences , it is only about helping people . " he added that he would be mobilizing emergency services to help the afflicted areas . in a statement timed to support his pledge , defense minister peter struck said some 1,000 soldiers had been deployed to boost flood defenses with another 1,000 on standby . other politicians were also quick to react to the catastrophe .
the cdu and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , a likely coalition partner of the conservatives in a future government , called off their planned summit on wednesday saying that the affected regions had priority . meanwhile interior minister otto schily was on the ground visiting the worst hit areas of garmisch-partenkirchen , mühldorf am inn and eschenlohe while foreign minsiter joschka fischer was said to be talking to eu officials in brussels with a view to securing aid . will the floods save schröder agai n ? the event has inevitably stirred memories of the 2002 election campaign when catastrophic floods in eastern germany were largely credited for schröder 's re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröeder talks to a resident in front of her damaged house in grimma , eastern germany .
at the time , schröder - who was badly trailing in the polls - rushed to eastern germany to offer affected residents sympathy and aid worth millions .
television images of the chancellor wading through the flood waters in rubber boots and a green raincoat to visit affected homes and residents is believed to have helped to sway voters , thus ensuring that schröder came up from behind to defeat his conservative challenger edmund stoiber . this time seems no different and germany 's media is already commenting wryly on the political mileage to be extracted from the catastrophe and whether it might save schröder yet again . " bavaria under water .
schröder 's coming , " read the headline in the berliner zeitung on wednesday .
" the elbe river floods dominated talks for weeks and decided the election -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .

"
löhr suggested that some artworks which hang in museums and collections in berlin have the mark of an original , legal owner somewhere in their history . stole n art u n witti n gly bought all over the world it 's been suggested that after the war , many of the missing works passed through the federal government in bonn and the austrian federal government as well as private collections in both countries while others ended up in the hands of art thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlene von saher points to the painting once owned by her grandfather titled , " the temptation of st. anthony , " in new york .
the painting is part of an extensive collection of old master art that was stolen by the nazis in holland 60 years ago .
löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .

china and the eu hope to sort out the textile row beijing and brussels were set to begin trade negotiations over booming chinese textile exports with china expecting the eu to capitulate and increase import quotas , according to chinese sources on wednesday . negotiators are scheduled to meet in beijing on thursday to work out a plan to alleviate millions of dollars of chinese textiles that have surpassed import quotas negotiated in june and are now stranded in european ports , chinese and eu officials said . " canceling the quotas is what we hope for most and is also the hope of england , germany , sweden , denmark and finland , but it will make other countries unhappy , so it 's not a possible solution , " mei xinyu , a leading analyst at the ministry of commerce told afp . one " measure is to use part of next year 's quota this year , but it is not enough to solve the problem , so a much better idea is to lift the quota by a very large scale . " some 48 million sweaters , 17 million pairs of trousers and nearly 500,000 blouses produced in china are currently blocked by authorities in european ports , according to the latest figures cited by the french trade ministry . in addition to this , 1.6 million t-shirts , 3.4 million bras and 1,470 tons of flax yarn are also being kept back because they exceed the quotas . rush by eu retailers resulted i n huge orders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of the products were ordered by european retailers in rush orders to beat the import restrictions and many contracts explicitly place the burden for losses due to the quotas on the importing side , the beiji n g news said . " many companies were worried that they would not meet demand because of the eu quotas on chinese textiles , so one by one they began to quicken the pace of their import orders , " shen suqin , general manager of the jiangsu xiangsheng textile company , told the paper . the daily said chinese negotiators were expecting a victory in the talks and carried a cartoon with four half naked europeans standing on a dock holding a welcome sign as a chinese ship loaded with clothes is anchored off shore .
" european apparel retailers are facing an embarrassing situation of having no goods because of the european union quotas , " the caption read . europe a n d us worki n g to curb rampa n t imports bildunterschrift : according to the eco n omic daily , chinese textile exports surpassed 50.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.5 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of the year , with textile export value exceeding 8.1 billion euros in each of june and july as the eu and the united states worked to curb the booming trade and protect local industries . chinese textile exports to europe in june alone hit 1.7 billion euros , up 85 percent from the same month in 2004 , coming just as the two sides were working out a deal to cap the surge , the paper said , citing customs statistics . chinese textiles have surged dramatically after a global textile quota system was abolished on jan .
1 as part of world trade organization efforts to liberalize international trade . the surge , however , prompted the eu and the united states to re-implement the quotas provisionally on chinese textile exports in an effort to protect domestic manufacturers . us , chi n a also faili n g to fi n d commo n grou n d bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us commerce secretary , donald evans speaks during a press conference in beijing , china , thursday , jan 13 , 2005 .
evan is involved in negotiations with china .

video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far . germany 's train stations are on their way to becoming among the most guarded public places in the country .
interior minister otto schily announced on monday that he planned to increase the amount of camera surveillance of the country 's train stations as well as the number of security personnel patrolling the platforms .
the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .
spurred on by the success british investigators experienced in tracking down bombing suspects on the underground 's closed circuit television system , cities like moscow and rome are vowing to improve the security of their citizens by increasing the number and quality of surveillance cameras in their transit stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance proved effective in catching suspects in the london bombings balancing security and liberty plans in germany to do the same are being welcomed by police organizations as well as data protectionists - to a point .
" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .
typically , footage collected by cameras in transit stations is held for 48 hours and then erased .
that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .
silke stokar , the domestic affairs spokesman for the green 's parliamentary faction , criticized secret video surveillance and called for more transparency .
schaar : cameras do n't catch all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter schaar though schaar -lrb- photo -rrb- does not take issue with schily 's video surveillance plans , he did think stepping up the number of security personnel would be more effective .
" we do n't want people to get the illusion that video surveillance takes care of everything , " said schaar .
" even if an area is watched by video does n't mean that crimes are n't possible or that catching criminals is automatic .
the visible presence of -lrb- security -rrb- personnel is more effective than these electronic eyes . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects phone taps though germany 's highest court on wednesday dealt a blow of telephone tapping , several european countries are mulling anti-terror measures that would increase video surveillance .

the measure is not a reaction to the deadly london bombings of july 7 , but part of a long-term strategy , said schily in making the announcement .
a major component of the new strategy is a new security center , where eight officers work together with german rail -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- security officers . " the security of railway passengers is a high priority , especially considering the upcoming soccer world championships in germany , " said schily . in the weeks since bombings in the london underground killed 52 commuters , several european capitals have promised more surveillance of the public sphere in an effort to snuff out criminal and terrorist activity .

" especially in this age of terrorism , the proportionality of the measures need to be considered , " said peter schaar , germany 's commissioner for data protection . " it 's the goal of terrorism to change society , and attack democratic institutions . " schaar said he has nothing against schily 's plans , provided they continue the system agreed upon by both police and data protectionists .

that is usually long enough to make a dent in criminal statistics . in 2004 , 703 crimes were caught on camera , 546 suspects investigated and 411 crimes solved .
in 772 cases , police were able to get involved before a crime was committed , according to the interior minister .
selective video surveillance proposed police organizations , like the german association of criminal investigators , argue that video surveillance should be expanded selectively .
spokesman bernd carstensen said that police knowledge and criminal statistics should be used to determine where cameras can be useful .
" we support the expansion … but not everywhere , " said carstensen .
" the next step needs to be to have actual police officers watching the footage these cameras provide and allow them to act when a crime is being committed . " green party members on tuesday warned not to sacrifice civil liberties for security .

they are also worried about a plan by the british government to deport hardline islamists to countries where they may face torture or even execution . clarke said the plan would take effect " very quickly .
the next few days . " he said he had an obligation " to stop people coming into this country to get young people , in particular , to behave in the appalling way we saw in july . " part of larger crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scenes at edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
the list is part of a wide-ranging government crackdown on islamic extremist and other groups in the wake of the july 7 suicide bombings , which killed 56 people , and attempted copycat attacks on july 21 . prime minister tony blair warned earlier this month " the rules of the game are changing . " the home office plan - compiled after a two-week consultation with muslim groups and other organizations - applies both to non-british citizens already in the country and those who want to come to britain .
it will be used as a basis for clarke to ban or deport people from britain . the so-called " unacceptable behaviors " include those which : foment , justify or glorify terrorist violence , seek to provoke others to terrorist acts , foment other serious criminal activity or seek to provoke others to commit serious criminal acts , or foster hatred which might lead to inter-community violence in britain . the banned views could be aired by writing , producing or distributing material , public speaking or over an internet site .
they could also be delivered by someone in a position of responsibility such as a teacher or a community leader . those given a deportation order in britain have the right to appeal , while anyone banned from entering the country can seek a judicial review . muslims concerned inayat bunglawala , a spokesman for the muslim council of britain , disagreed , arguing the criteria were too vague . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims listen to the imam at their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque , in london , friday july 8 , 2005 .
" we are especially concerned that senior islamic scholars will be barred from the uk purely on the basis of media witch hunts orchestrated by pro-israeli elements , " bunglawala said . in addition , the united nations ' special rapporteur on torture , manfred nowak , said britain 's plan to deport firebrand islamists to countries with poor human rights records would expose them to " a real risk " of the death penalty . but clarke responded angrily , saying the un should pay more attention to the rights of the victims . " the human rights of those people who were blown up on the tube in london on july 7 are , to be quite frank , more important than the human rights of the people who committed those acts , " he told the itv news channel . " it is a balance , of course , and i acknowledge that there are real issues that have to be addressed , but i wish the un would look at human rights in the round rather than simply focusing all the time on the terrorist .

what is to be done with " too much " knowledge ?
dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .

dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

dw-world talked to wolfgang van den daele , member of the national ethics council . wolfga n g va n de n daele is director of the departme n t for civil society a n d tra n s n atio n al n etworks at the wisse n schaftsze n trum berli n für sozialforschu n g -lrb- berli n ce n ter for social research -rrb- .

dw-world : the germa n constitution says " human dignity is inviolable . "
who defines what constitutes dignity and what exactly does " inviolable " mean in this context ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang van den daele wolfgang van den daele : human dignity as referred to in our constitution first and foremost means the protection of the individual and her right to self-determination from the arbitrariness of state power .
but can human dignity itself become a limit to self-determination ?
is the concept of dignity a limit or the very source of freedom ?
faced with the fact that biotechnology can change our lives and human nature , there is a tendency to say that dignity must be somehow defined in an objective way .
a n d what does " objective " mea n i n this co n text ?
there have always been attempts to define human dignity by reference to cultural values .
but in the course of history values are subject to change .
now then this is the problem : do we want to accept an " objective " dignity that is opposed to the free choice of individuals .
this concerns drug use , featuring in a peep-show , cosmetic surgery , for instance , that is to say all cases in which the people concerned have agreed to be doing this and others are doing this to them .
you me n tio n cosmetic surgery : does a perso n have a basic right to correcti n g the imperfect ?
every person has a right to correction .
no one doubts that .
but the question is : are you allowed to correct others - for example your kids ? … a n d , is it allowed ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : specimen slide with embryonic stem cells yes - if one is convinced that this is happening in the interest of the child 's wellbeing .
if someone has an inherited genetic disorder then it is okay to try to modify germ cells , for instance .
i do n't see how someone could say this contravenes human dignity .
it is not against my dignity or that of the child to deprive it of the " chance " to be born with a severe hereditary disease .
what do you make of embryo n ic research or therapeutic clo n i n g ?
it depends on whether we consider an embryo a human being - or if we see it as something that may be " sacrificed " for a higher purpose of human life , for example to develop stem cells that can be used to cure other people .
what is the ge n eral sta n ce o n this issue i n germa n y ?
there is a battle being fought .
one group says : an embryo is a human being and has full claim to the protection of his human dignity .
the others say : an embryo is a preliminary stage to a human person .
typically they refer to judaism , which says that up to 40 days after conception there is nothing yet that counts .
also according to old catholic teachings - that were being followed for centuries - an embryo from a moral point of view did not count for anything until it acquired its soul from god .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian anti-stem cell research groups campaigned with posters reading " we 're all former embryos " this year my point of view is also that an embryo is not a human being in the full sense , but a stage in the development of human life .
the embryo can - and should - yield to the right to freedom of others if this is required by the circumstances .
i think it is right that a large part of society sees it this way .
however , this does not mean , that we consider the embryo as morally irrelevant !
as far as research is co n cer n ed : there is n o way of steppi n g back from what o n e already k n ows - but does o n e really have to k n ow everythi n g ?
no , you do n't have to .
but if we decide not to know something , others will do it .
knowledge can not be controlled .
then again one does not have to do everything , but who is " one " anyway ?
is it german society ?
the individual ?
sure , the individual does not have to .
an entirely different question is , if society as a whole is allowed to force the individual not to do something .
there have to be important reasons for society to be allowed to pull the plug - for instance when the rights of other people are violated .
you can not conduct research to attain knowledge if it involves torturing people .
another reason would be : the consequences for society are devastating .
but there is a duty to explain and a heavy burden of proof .
it is not enough to simply claim devastating consequences .
we can not cut ourselves off from knowledge .
as soon as science has produced a way to cure an affliction , people are asking for it .
this is human .
but i doubt that as regards bioethics we have moral norms that are shared the world over .
yes , we do have human rights , but there is no global moral view on how to deal with embryos .
is there a legal claim to complia n ce with particular n orms ?
or that society follows certai n values ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laws and morals are n't always the same no , there is only the constitution , and legal claims that derive from international treaties or national laws .
moral demands are based on universal moral principles and there are no moral claims based on values of a local community - a " local ethics , " so to say .
this means that individual societies have different standards .
but also within these societies there are individual groups with different standards .
they are all subject to the same laws , but there is no common ethics .
but there are " research isla n ds " i n other regio n s a n d cultures , i n which other n orms apply tha n i n europe .
a n d they push the limits of what ca n or may be do n e further a n d further ...
absolutely .
in germany we ca n't tell them : you are immoral , you are violating human dignity .
the only thing we can say is : we are not doing it .
that is what 's so interesting about stem cell research .
in germany it basically does not happen .
but elsewhere they do it , this means the results of stem cell research are available .
now - shall we use these results ?
of course we will !
if useful drugs are made as a result , we will import them , if there are transplantation techniques , we will use them .
but surely the people have to be told how a n d u n der what circumsta n ces these were created ?
i am not sure about that .
do they have to know ?
you mean people would reject it if they knew that embryos were used to produce it ?
for example ...
i do n't actually think so .
but of course this could be the case .
up to now there 's is only compulsory labeling for anything that has been produced using genetic modification .
but whether it has been tested in clinical trials or experiments on humans does not have to be declared .
there is an international consensus that this information is irrelevant .
national parliaments could introduce legislation requiring that this information be made available , but i am not aware of any such initiative .
it 's possible that there are people who would prefer this , but their chances are slim .
i do n't see a majority for their position or a parliament that would introduce such a measure .

the couple face up to 15 years in prison if convicted . notified by the mother of the 7-year-old girl , police turned up at the hamburg apartment in march to find jessica 's skeletal body , weighing just 21 pounds . her parents told police that she had been vomiting , and then fell into a coma after crawling into bed with her father .
an autopsy later revealed she had choked on her own vomit , likely induced by an intestinal obstruction caused by a lack of food . on wednesday , a regional court judge charged the 36-year-old mother and 49-year-old father with murder by neglect , saying they had agreed to let jessica die of hunger . a lawyer for the mother , identified only as marlies sch. told a packed courtroom that she would plead guilty , but not implicate the father , whom he described as a weak-willed man . " my client plans to confess her guilt .
she does not expect any understanding or compassion , " he said . a shocked nation jessica 's horrific death shocked the country earlier this year .
soon after her body was taken away , police put the parents in jail , as prosecutors began piecing together their case . police later said the parents had kept the girl in a darkened room , with no heating and no access to water or a toilet .
citing investigators , a report in this week 's der spiegel revealed that the father , identified only as burkhard m. tried to set a trap to electrocute the young girl . psychiatrists have since speculated that the parents , who apparently had alcohol problems , suffer from extreme personality problems rooted in their own traumatic experiences as children .
the parents denied having had a hand in their daughter 's death , and portrayed her as difficult child to investigators , according to spiegel . nobody knew bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica 's funeral : germans mourned the little girl who never had any friends during her short life .

" the biggest smoking gun that everyone was waving is now eliminated with these conclusions , " the paper quoted a senior official as saying . the iaea , according to western diplomats , has already concluded that enriched uranium particles found in iran were from smuggled pakistani equipment . iran has long contended that the uranium traces were the result of contaminated equipment bought years ago from pakistan .

" despite the claims of the europeans , it was not iran that violated the paris agreement , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told the state news agency irna .
he was referring to a november 2004 deal under which iran agreed to freeze its nuclear fuel cycle activities - which it insists are only aimed at power generation but which could potentially be diverted to making a bomb . " the europeans are to blame for unilaterally interpreting and violating the paris agreement , " asefi said , repeating iran 's contention that it has the right under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- to produce its own nuclear fuel .

" despite the claims of the europeans , it was not iran that violated the paris agreement , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told the state news agency irna .
he was referring to a november 2004 deal under which iran agreed to freeze its nuclear fuel cycle activities - which it insists are only aimed at power generation but which could potentially be diverted to making a bomb . " the europeans are to blame for unilaterally interpreting and violating the paris agreement , " asefi said , repeating iran 's contention that it has the right under the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- to produce its own nuclear fuel . " the europeans ignored iran 's rights . " eu-3 still wa n t talks despite ca n celed meeti n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe douste-blazy with german counterpart joschka fischer .
despite calling off the negotiating meeting , the european powers are still keen to talk to iran about its sensitive nuclear program , according to french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy . douste-blazy said the eu-3 , acting on behalf of the european union , were not ending the discussions . " we are suspending the negotiations , " he told france i n ter radio .
" but at the same time , we think it is still possible to talk to them ...
there is no reason to close the door on iran . " " until the last minute , we hope to be able to talk to them , " douste-blazy said .

" the biggest smoking gun that everyone was waving is now eliminated with these conclusions , " the paper quoted a senior official as saying . the iaea , according to western diplomats , has already concluded that enriched uranium particles found in iran were from smuggled pakistani equipment . iran has long contended that the uranium traces were the result of contaminated equipment bought years ago from pakistan .
but washington had pointed to the material as evidence that iran was making bomb-grade ingredients . the state department stressed tuesday that the question about contamination was only " one part of this overall set of questions " about iran 's nuclear program . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis looms as iran rejects eu nuke offer iran on friday rejected a broad package of trade and technology incentives offered by the european union if it agreed to abandon all nuclear fuel work , risking an international crisis .

a new book looks at where the nazi leader 's collection came from - and where it went . it remains at the center of one of world war ii 's most enduring mysteries : hitler 's intended national socialist museum of art in the austrian city of linz was a dream that was never fully realized by the führer although many thousands of art works were obtained for the project . speculation has always surrounded the origins of the dictator 's collection but since the war ended , this has only intensified as experts attempt to discover where many of the works disappeared to . berlin historian hanns christian löhr is the latest to examine the mystery behind the alleged stolen art which was destined for the linz museum and what happened after the allies " liberated " the artifacts in his book , " the brown house of art . " in 1943 , hitler created the so n derauftrag li n z -lrb- special assignment linz -rrb- to set up an art collection for the austrian city of the same name on the banks of the danube river .
almost exclusively financed by funds earned through sales of hitler 's book " mein kampf " and from special stamps showing his portrait , the linz collection was more or less the private affair of the führer .
in an attempt to protect the collection from the intensive bombing campaigns of the final years of the conflicts , many of these works were stored in salt mine caverns near linz .
but as the imminent german defeat approached , the nazi commandant of the facility ordered the salt mines and artworks destroyed . allies liberatio n led to the loss of ma n y works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately , no wholesale destruction occurred and the majority of the collection was confiscated by the allied forces which had already begun to bring works of art recovered from various depots to special collection points where a system was set up to find the legal owners . however , not all the artifacts were returned . speaking in berlin on tuesday , löhr said that his new book reopens the debate as to what became of the art that never found its way home and that the revelations were " explosive . "
löhr suggested that some artworks which hang in museums and collections in berlin have the mark of an original , legal owner somewhere in their history . stole n art u n witti n gly bought all over the world it 's been suggested that after the war , many of the missing works passed through the federal government in bonn and the austrian federal government as well as private collections in both countries while others ended up in the hands of art thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlene von saher points to the painting once owned by her grandfather titled , " the temptation of st. anthony , " in new york .
the painting is part of an extensive collection of old master art that was stolen by the nazis in holland 60 years ago .
löhr 's research has unearthed 191 missing artifacts from a previously unknown catalogue from the linz collection , with paintings from the collection turning up in france , the netherlands and as far afield as the united states . as well as the current whereabouts of the collection , the book addresses the question as to where the paintings originated from and how they were procured . author agrees that few pai n ti n gs were looted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann göring : art lover while hermann voss , the supervisor of the special assignment linz , and gottfried reimer the collection 's co-curator , maintained that only 53 of the 4,353 pictures collected for the museum in linz were confiscated works - procured by hermann göring -lrb- photo -rrb- in paris - rumors during and after the war suggested that much of the collection had been stolen or seized by occupying nazi soldiers across europe . löhrs research backs up the claims of the curators by saying that only a small part of the collection - possibly 12 percent - came from seizures or expropriations . even if this is true , the nazis were responsible for much of the art stolen , and then subsequently lost , during and after world war ii .
the on-going search for the artifacts and the quest for compensation for the legal owners in most of these cases goes on . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the hassles of returning stolen art a long legal wrangle in germany over the return of three paintings seized by the nazis was resolved on wednesday .

members of oxfordshire county council 's cabinet are to consider the £ 600,000 plan for oxford 's eastern bypass .
the boys - and a 21-year-old man - died after a head-on collision on the a4142 on 28 may .
roads bosses say action had not been taken before because there had been few such accidents on the road .
' reasoned exception ' that meant the road had not met the standard criteria to be eligible for funding in the past - but the recent accident and calls from the public have overridden that .
richard dix , the council 's interim head of transport , said : " i regard this as a reasoned exception to the general rule on safety schemes and not a precedent to set those rules aside . "
the council 's engineers have proposed building a vertical concrete safety barrier because high-voltage power cables running along the central reservation have ruled out normal metal barriers .
it has also been proposed to reduce the road 's speed limit to 50mph .
howard hillsdon was driving one of the cars involved councillor david robertson , the county council 's cabinet member for transport , said : " this has been a very complex matter for a number of reasons .
" we have had to look at the history of the site , our own resources , the needs of electricity companies and the requests of the general public .
" the scheme that has been proposed , a specific type of barrier and a speed limit , takes all that in to account . "
the cabinet will consider the plan at a meeting on 6 september .
josh bartlett and marshall haynes , both 13 , their friend liam hastings , also 13 , and howard hillsdon , 21 , all died in the crash .

his mother died because of complications during childbirth , near the village of touka bayel in the drought-ravaged north of burkina faso .
a young victim of the food crisis that grips west africa , he lives on goat 's milk but has not had any for two days , because the women now looking after him are too poor to buy it regularly .
wrapped tightly to the back of his mother 's younger sister , tana fatimata hama , 24 , as she goes to get some medicine , he is a wide-eyed , foetal shadow of infancy .
a lethal combination of drought and locusts has savaged crops in the north of burkina faso , as it has done in neighbouring niger , mali and mauritania .
according to the world food programme -lrb- wfp -rrb- , 1m burkinabe are in need of food assistance .
double whammy burkina 's farmers rank among the poorest in the world , but this year has seen them lose up to 90 % of their harvest .
as a result they have had no crops to survive on , and have sold up to 75 % of their cattle to raise enough money to buy grain at inflated prices .
west africa hunger map the lack of food is turning an already difficult existence into a desperate battle for life .
" it 's much harder for the villagers , " says issa dicko hama , 21 , a trader in the market of dori , the nearest town .
" there 're really facing difficulties .
millet prices -lsb- per 100kg bag -rsb- have shot up from 10,000 cfa francs -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- to 25,000 cfa francs -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- and animal prices have collapsed . "
this double whammy has hit the fulani herders of the region hard .
they are fast running out of animals to sell .
herds of 300 have dwindled to 20 , either dead from hunger , or sold for a pittance in the struggle to raise money for millet , the staple crop .
the food does n't last long , with three cows buying enough grain to last a family three days .
rainy season " people are ill ; they ca n't eat , " says boukoum hama ousmane , 62 , the senior elder of touka bayel .
" husbands have fled . "
he says many men have left for war-torn ivory coast , where an estimated 3m burkinabe earn their crust , to look for work and food on cocoa and cotton plantations . "
people do n't come here anymore - people die in their homes " claris zongo , nurse " there 's war there but if you want to eat you can .
we 've been given a little only .
it 's not been enough . "
the wfp in burkina faso has requested an additional $ 1.4m to deal with the crisis .
but money wo n't stop the same thing from happening again .
" somebody has got to resolve the problem of mounting food prices and falling animal prices in the long term , " says ali ouattara , who runs the wfp 's regional office in dori .
" they have to bring them together to create a balance . "
the wet season brings its own problems .
like other villages in the region , touka bayel is remote , hidden at the end of rutted dirt tracks that twist to nothing .
heavy rains turn the roads of the sahel into quagmires that hold trucks fast , hampering the relief effort and prompting the wfp to distribute six months ' emergency rations to health centres , instead of three .
the normally sandy streets of dori are still awash with last week 's thunderous downpour .
illness the hospital and other buildings in the town have become islands amid lakes of stagnant water , breeding grounds for malaria .
although the rains have sent millet stalks thrusting skywards , the harvest will not be ready for another month .
in the meantime , touka bayel , and other villages across northern burkina faso , must hang on .
villagers are surviving on a diet of wild grass and milk from the few animals that remain .
many are too tired to work in the fields , at a vital time in the cultivating season .
illness has soared , but the health centre stays empty .
" people do n't come here anymore , " says claris zongo , a nurse there .
" people have malaria but they have no money and nothing to eat .
people die in their homes . "

a lethal combination of drought and locusts has savaged crops in the north of burkina faso , as it has done in neighbouring niger , mali and mauritania .
according to the world food programme -lrb- wfp -rrb- , 1m burkinabe are in need of food assistance .
double whammy burkina 's farmers rank among the poorest in the world , but this year has seen them lose up to 90 % of their harvest .
as a result they have had no crops to survive on , and have sold up to 75 % of their cattle to raise enough money to buy grain at inflated prices .

this double whammy has hit the fulani herders of the region hard .
they are fast running out of animals to sell .
herds of 300 have dwindled to 20 , either dead from hunger , or sold for a pittance in the struggle to raise money for millet , the staple crop .
the food does n't last long , with three cows buying enough grain to last a family three days .

many of the 9,748 attacks on passengers and staff involved alcohol , said british transport police .
it said it had " serious concerns " about plans to extend licensing hours as it launched its annual report .
the figures do not include the london bombings , but the force said it was facing the threat of further attacks and that it was training officers .
' alcohol connection ' overall , the number of offences british transport police dealt with was down 2 % .
transport crime 2004 there were a total of 9,748 cases of violent crime on the uk 's railways 1,604 fewer crimes were reported - a fall of 1.9 % robberies were down 20 % a third of all crime on the london underground and docklands light railway was pickpocketing violence rose 14 % on the london underground public order offences up 27 % .
violent crime up on the tube but it said the increase in violent crime - including a 23 % rise in wales and an 11 % rise in england - was worrying .
violent incidents fell by 2 % in scotland .
british transport police chief constable ian johnston said there had been a noticeable increase in the reporting of alcohol related incidents and longer pub opening hours could exacerbate the problem .
he told bbc news : " we flag crimes that have an alcohol connection .
so if we arrest a burglar or a robber who 's drunk we flag the crime .
" and we 've had about a 30 % increase in that level of flagging across the force over the last year . "
mr johnston said the " big issue " is that " longer hours means longer coverage " , with the possibility of resources being overstretched if officers have to spend more of their time dealing with drunks .
drinking culture it is not the first time government plans to extend licensing hours from 24 november have attracted criticism .
alcohol-related crime and disorder blighting our town and city centres is happening now department for culture , media and sport spokesman violence fear at new law judges have warned the move will lead to an increase in the number of rapes and serious assaults , while police chiefs have warned of a holiday-resort style drinking culture .
but the government said the " status quo " and not extended opening was the problem .
" flexible opening hours will reduce the need to speed drink , " said a spokesman for the department for culture , media and sport .
" it will end the double madness of people gulping two or three rounds of drinks to beat last orders and then all being thrown out onto the streets at the same time . "
rail maritime and transport union general secretary bob crow said : " it is deeply disturbing that violence on the railways is still on the increase .
" we need adequate staff on every station all the time they are open and a guard on every train , including on the tube . "
have you experienced crime on the railways ?
send us your comments .
who are they trying to kid .
the chances of finding a train still running after current closing time is extremely small .
finding a train after extended hours. no chance .
so how can it make the problem worse ?
r , manchester uk privatised rail companies mean as few staff as possible manning stations in order that costs are kept to a minimum .
it 's very rare to see transport police anywhere , and only when cardiff sees a big game , or there are terrorist attacks do you see any police .
why do n't the transport police advertise for specials ?
people could then legitimately police their own transport as they commute to and from work .
just a suggestion .
paul , wales the government are clearly trying their hardest to make the uk as difficult to live in as possible .
they need to wake up to the fact that as a nation we have a large drink problem and to think that solving this problem is to extend the amount of time people can and will drink in pubs , is crazy .
we are not like the rest of europe who do n't drink to get drunk .
how many more people have to get hurt before drink laws are tightened and the police get the support they need and deserve ?
l , manchester , england i 've seen violent or threatening behaviour on trains many times , sometimes alcohol-fuelled , sometimes not .
currently most people look the other way and try not to get involved .
the answer is simple ; eject them off the train immediately .
on some trains they sell alcohol .
that should be stopped too .
neil , wrexham , wales as a commuter between london and billericay for 12 years , i have seen all manner of appalling -lrb- and quite obviously drink-fuelled -rrb- behaviour on trains .
fights , over-amorous encounters , sustained vomiting , and general unruliness were all too common on friday night trains home .
the 12.51 service from liverpool street to southend earned its nickname " the vomit comet " every friday night .
one thing that was rarely seen , however , was either a police or train guard presence .
only in the last 6 months of my commute did i see either in attendance .
i am glad that i now no longer have to commute by train , and pity those that do , especially late at night .

british transport police chief constable ian johnston said there had been a noticeable increase in the reporting of alcohol related incidents and longer pub opening hours could exacerbate the problem .
he told bbc news : " we flag crimes that have an alcohol connection .
so if we arrest a burglar or a robber who 's drunk we flag the crime .
" and we 've had about a 30 % increase in that level of flagging across the force over the last year . "

" it will end the double madness of people gulping two or three rounds of drinks to beat last orders and then all being thrown out onto the streets at the same time . "
rail maritime and transport union general secretary bob crow said : " it is deeply disturbing that violence on the railways is still on the increase .

have you experienced crime on the railways ?
send us your comments .
who are they trying to kid .
the chances of finding a train still running after current closing time is extremely small .
finding a train after extended hours. no chance .
so how can it make the problem worse ?
r , manchester uk privatised rail companies mean as few staff as possible manning stations in order that costs are kept to a minimum .
it 's very rare to see transport police anywhere , and only when cardiff sees a big game , or there are terrorist attacks do you see any police .
why do n't the transport police advertise for specials ?
people could then legitimately police their own transport as they commute to and from work .
just a suggestion .

they need to wake up to the fact that as a nation we have a large drink problem and to think that solving this problem is to extend the amount of time people can and will drink in pubs , is crazy .
we are not like the rest of europe who do n't drink to get drunk .
how many more people have to get hurt before drink laws are tightened and the police get the support they need and deserve ?
l , manchester , england i 've seen violent or threatening behaviour on trains many times , sometimes alcohol-fuelled , sometimes not .
currently most people look the other way and try not to get involved .
the answer is simple ; eject them off the train immediately .
on some trains they sell alcohol .
that should be stopped too .
neil , wrexham , wales as a commuter between london and billericay for 12 years , i have seen all manner of appalling -lrb- and quite obviously drink-fuelled -rrb- behaviour on trains .
fights , over-amorous encounters , sustained vomiting , and general unruliness were all too common on friday night trains home .
the 12.51 service from liverpool street to southend earned its nickname " the vomit comet " every friday night .
one thing that was rarely seen , however , was either a police or train guard presence .
only in the last 6 months of my commute did i see either in attendance .
i am glad that i now no longer have to commute by train , and pity those that do , especially late at night .

the head of sony computer entertainment in the uk , ray maguire , told the bbc news website there would no price cut before christmas .
sony is hoping to buoy up sales by offering different types of ps2 games .
the xbox 360 is due to go on sale in november , while sony 's next generation console is due out early next year .
veteran console the ps2 was the first of the current generation of consoles to hit the shops .
it was first released in japan in march 2000 and in november of the same year in the uk .
sony has sold more than 7.5 million ps2s in the uk the console initially sold for £ 300 .
but the cost has progressively fallen as sony battled with microsoft and nintendo to dominate the console gaming market .
sony has historically chosen late august or early september to announced pre-christmas price cuts .
the last one was in august a year ago , when the retail price fell to £ 100 .
the console was redesigned around the same time to make it smaller and thinner .
sony 's strategy worked , with many seeking out a ps2 for christmas , though many shops were hit by stock shortages .
narrow margin in an interview with the bbc news website , mr maguire dashed hopes that history would repeat itself .
70 % of the uk does not have a playstation 2 ray maguire , sony computer entertainment uk he said sony was aiming to lower the cost of making the ps2 .
but he explained that with a retail price of £ 100 , there was little room for manoeuvre .
" we want to re-engineer the console and drive costs down , " said mr maguire , but he added there was little room for efficiencies in the components of the console .
when pressed on when the price might fall , he insisted it would not happen before christmas .
even though there were ps2s in 7.5 million homes in the uk , mr maguire said there was still room to grow .
" 70 % of the uk does not have a playstation 2 , " he said .
sony 's tactic to lure people who do not think of themselves as gamers is to focus on innovative games such as the music quiz game buzz and the exercise title kinetic .
the japanese games giant is also counting on its new handheld console , the playstation portable , to make a splash when it is released in the uk on 1 september .
this christmas will see the release of the first of the new wave of game consoles , with microsoft 's xbox 360 due out in november .
the playstation 3 is due out in the first half of next year , with nintendo 's revolution some time later .

the head of sony computer entertainment in the uk , ray maguire , told the bbc news website there would no price cut before christmas .
sony is hoping to buoy up sales by offering different types of ps2 games .
the xbox 360 is due to go on sale in november , while sony 's next generation console is due out early next year .
veteran console the ps2 was the first of the current generation of consoles to hit the shops .
it was first released in japan in march 2000 and in november of the same year in the uk .
the console initially sold for £ 300 .
but the cost has progressively fallen as sony battled with microsoft and nintendo to dominate the console gaming market .
sony has historically chosen late august or early september to announced pre-christmas price cuts .
the last one was in august a year ago , when the retail price fell to £ 100 .
the console was redesigned around the same time to make it smaller and thinner .
sony 's strategy worked , with many seeking out a ps2 for christmas , though many shops were hit by stock shortages .
narrow margin in an interview with the bbc news website , mr maguire dashed hopes that history would repeat itself . " 70 % of the uk does not have a playstation 2 " ray maguire , sony computer entertainment uk he said sony was aiming to lower the cost of making the ps2 .
but he explained that with a retail price of £ 100 , there was little room for manoeuvre .
" we want to re-engineer the console and drive costs down , " said mr maguire , but he added there was little room for efficiencies in the components of the console .
when pressed on when the price might fall , he insisted it would not happen before christmas .
even though there were ps2s in 7.5 million homes in the uk , mr maguire said there was still room to grow .
" 70 % of the uk does not have a playstation 2 , " he said .
sony 's tactic to lure people who do not think of themselves as gamers is to focus on innovative games such as the music quiz game buzz and the exercise title kinetic .
the japanese games giant is also counting on its new handheld console , the playstation portable , to make a splash when it is released in the uk on 1 september .
this christmas will see the release of the first of the new wave of game consoles , with microsoft 's xbox 360 due out in november .
the playstation 3 is due out in the first half of next year , with nintendo 's revolution some time later .

the campaign to protect rural england -lrb- cpre -rrb- said it should be made a legal duty of local authorities to enforce planning permission regulations .
but the office of the deputy prime minister said that was unnecessary .
it said it was working on regulations on controlling outdoor adverts and will be reminding councils of their powers .
some farmers who have hired out their fields for advertisements said they were only following the government 's advice to find more diverse sources of income .
regulatory consent ?
the cpre said many types of roadside advertising were authorised by regulations - but these were predominantly located in urban areas . "
billboards and hoardings are mushrooming alongside motorways and major roads " paul miner , cpre in a survey , it counted nearly 900 billboards on major routes in the countryside across england - an average of one every three miles .
these advertisements were either placed on trailers in fields or were on hoardings alongside roads , the cpre said .
the group said it believed many of the advertisements had been set up without the necessary regulatory consent .
" for more than 50 years , planning controls have saved the english landscape from the pox of outdoor advertising , " said paul miner , the cpre 's planning campaigner .
" this achievement is now in danger .
billboards and hoardings are mushrooming alongside motorways and major roads across england , despite government policy and regulations clearly stating they should be strictly controlled . "
" we are currently working on new regulations to control outdoor advertising " office of the deputy prime minister in a statement , the office of the deputy prime minister said : " we do not agree with the cpre 's call for a legal duty to enforce advertisement controls as it is often sufficient to get the advertisement removed by alerting the landowner to the penalties for displaying an unlawful advertisement .
" in july the office of the deputy prime minister wrote to all local planning authorities to remind them of their powers to deal with advertisements in fields alongside motorways and trunk roads .
" in addition we are currently working on new regulations to control outdoor advertising and intend to consult on them later this year , along with revised and updated guidance to remind local planning authorities of their powers to remove illegal advertisements . "

wherever possible , the statement continues , animal experiments must be replaced by methods that do not use them , and the number of animals in research must be reduced .

" we are building on that and the declaration will help . "
the rds declaration does not acknowledge the pain , suffering and distress that animal experiments cause brian mcgavin , rspca professor nancy rothwell , vice-president for research at the university of manchester , added : " it 's vitally important that the research community sends the message that animal research is crucial to medical progress , that it is conducted humanely , and that we work within strict regulations . "
however , animal welfare organisations have reacted with outrage to the declaration , arguing that it represents a lack of progress since the statement 15 years ago .
" we are concerned that in 15 years , doctors and scientists still appear committed to the unethical and potentially dangerous use of animals for medical research , " said adolfo sansolini , chief executive of the british union for the abolition of vivisection -lrb- buav -rrb- .
mr sansolini also disagrees with the assertion that there is a greater degree of transparency within the field of animal research .
" we had high hopes with the freedom of information act coming into force in january that animal experimentation would finally become more open , but this has not been the case , " he said .
brian mcgavin , of the rspca , told the bbc news website : " the rds declaration does not acknowledge the pain , suffering and distress that animal experiments cause , nor does it require any positive actions by the researchers who signed it . "

they have signed a declaration stating that a " small but vital " part of medical research involves animals .
the statement , which was drawn up by the research defence society -lrb- rds -rrb- , has disappointed animal welfare groups .
on tuesday , a staffordshire farm which breeds guinea pigs for medical research said it was to stop after intimidation by animal rights activists .
death threats the animals bred on family-run darley oaks farm , in newchurch , are used in developing treatments for respiratory diseases , such as asthma .
its owners and workers have been targeted , with some receiving death threats , during a six-year campaign by activists .
wednesday 's declaration , which is not linked to darley oaks ' decision , comes 15 years after a similar declaration by the british association for the advancement of science -lrb- ba -rrb- .
campaigners say it fails to acknowledge the " pain and suffering " animal experiments cause .
have your say " we would rather not use animals and we try hard to find alternatives " robin lovell-badge , nimr send us your comments signatories to the declaration on animals in medical research include three nobel laureates , 190 fellows of the royal society and the medical research college , as well as 250 university professors .
dr simon festing , executive director of rds , said : " we are delighted to have gathered over 500 signatures from top uk academic scientists and doctors in less than one month .
" it shows the strength and depth of support for humane animal research in this country . "
seeking alternatives the declaration states that researchers should gain the medical and scientific benefits that animal experiments can provide .
however , it also points out that scientists should make every effort to safeguard animal welfare and minimise suffering .
wherever possible , the statement continues , animal experiments must be replaced by methods that do not use them , and the number of animals in research must be reduced .
known as the " three r 's " , the concept of " replacement , refinement and reduction " forms the backbone of the uk government 's policy on animal research .
all the signatories have vowed to adhere to these principles .
" we would rather not use animals and we try hard to find alternatives , " said geneticist robin lovell-badge , of the national institute for medical research -lrb- nimr -rrb- in london .
" however , without the research we do there would be no progress in finding cures that alleviate pain , suffering and disease in animals as well as humans . "
' no progress ' the statement also promises to be more open about animal experimentation , urging research establishments to " provide clear information and foster rational discussion " .
" we have seen a mood of increased openness amongst researchers over the last two years , " said dr festing .
" we are building on that and the declaration will help . "

the firm has released a free service called google talk , which lets e-mail account holders talk to each other via a pc , microphone and speakers .
there had been speculation that google would use the cash from a $ 4bn share sale to buy its way into the market .
instead , google promised to try to make talk work with other firms ' offerings .
google talk will also offer instant messaging , but unlike other services such as skype or vonage it will not let users make calls to land lines or mobile phones .
' missing piece ' demand for online phone services is expected to surge in coming years as consumers look for cheaper ways of making calls and take advantage of quicker internet connections .
google is looking at different ways of boosting its revenues , and last year started offering a free e-mail service to a limited number of users - although they are now allowed to invite an effectively unlimited number of people to join as well .
it makes money from the e-mail service , called gmail , by placing small adverts along messages that are relevant to what is being discussed .
similarly , earlier this week the firm launched an updated version of a tool to search pc hard drives , which ties in closely with its online search engine .
google talk does not carry adverts , but google says it hopes it will drive people to sign up for gmail .
" this is a missing piece in google 's larger strategy as they emerge to become a bigger internet media player , " said greg sterling , an analyst at the kelsey group .
google talk 's software will be based on an open standard , meaning the firm will allow its technology to be integrated into other websites and applications .
google hopes that will encourage companies and individuals to expand its service and tailor it to better suit their needs .
catch up it also wants to offer users the ability to talk to people on other providers , something that some rivals with closed systems can not do at present .
analysts warned , however , that google had a lot of ground to make up on its rivals such as yahoo , aol and microsoft , which already have millions of signed up users .
