bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .

" i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president .

sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.01.2005 germany considers expanding dna testing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moshammer 's killer was arrested based on dna evidence a quickly solved high-profile murder case has led some german politicians to call for more dna testing .
but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .

but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .
above all , germany must set legal conditions for obligatory widespread genetic testing , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's your daddy ?

" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu . " schröder said the criteria should not be applied mechanically , but that credible growth and labor policies should allow countries to run higher deficits .
they should be given leeway if they introduced costly structural reforms or were suffering from economic stagnation , schröder wrote .
as an example , he pointed to his own government 's agenda 2010 labor market and tax reforms . the chancellor said allowances should also be made for countries shouldering " special economic burdens , " such as germany 's substantial financial transfers to its economically weak east as well its large contributions to the eu budget .

he also argued that the eu should have less power to take action against countries offending the rules . " the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions , " schröder wrote .
" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu . " schröder said the criteria should not be applied mechanically , but that credible growth and labor policies should allow countries to run higher deficits .
they should be given leeway if they introduced costly structural reforms or were suffering from economic stagnation , schröder wrote .
as an example , he pointed to his own government 's agenda 2010 labor market and tax reforms . the chancellor said allowances should also be made for countries shouldering " special economic burdens , " such as germany 's substantial financial transfers to its economically weak east as well its large contributions to the eu budget .
special treatment for germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros germany violated the stability pact for the third time in a row with its 2004 budget , which once more tipped the 3 percent deficit limit .
but it has n't been punished for its breaches . " we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't just designed for germany , but is valid for all the countries of the eurozone .
one country ca n't just say that its suffering exceptionally from it , " economist thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- , told dw-tv . since the euro has been able to hold its own , the rules should n't be softened , straubhaar said of the stability pact .
" otherwise , one should go ahead and bury it . " euro-zone finance ministers are set to meet in brussels monday evening to for two days of talks that will focus on changes to the stability pact . german finance minister hans eichel said monday he was hopeful that the eu would agree on changes to the euro rules in time for a european union summit in march .

" the acquisition appears to us to be motivated by empire-building .
if they -lrb- deutsche börse -rrb- were purely motivated by shareholder interests , they would put the acquisition to a vote , " said david slager , who manages atticus capital 's european fund , in remarks to the financial times . gathering voices of opposition atticus is the second major shareholder to publicly oppose the takeover plans .
british investment fund tci fund management llp -lrb- tci -rrb- , which says it holds around five percent of deutsche börse , voiced its opposition to the project on saturday . a tci statement similarly requested that an extraordinary shareholders meeting be held to vote on the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should instead buy back its own shares .
tci added that such a vote should also consider the possibility of replacing the german company 's entire supervisory board . german shareholders have also voiced their opposition .
union investment recently expressed reservations about the plans and said they would only support the move if the bidding price for the lse were not too high . " we favor a solution that would make sense from a businessman 's point of view .

" the acquisition appears to us to be motivated by empire-building .
if they -lrb- deutsche börse -rrb- were purely motivated by shareholder interests , they would put the acquisition to a vote , " said david slager , who manages atticus capital 's european fund , in remarks to the financial times . gathering voices of opposition atticus is the second major shareholder to publicly oppose the takeover plans .
british investment fund tci fund management llp -lrb- tci -rrb- , which says it holds around five percent of deutsche börse , voiced its opposition to the project on saturday . a tci statement similarly requested that an extraordinary shareholders meeting be held to vote on the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should instead buy back its own shares .
tci added that such a vote should also consider the possibility of replacing the german company 's entire supervisory board . german shareholders have also voiced their opposition .
union investment recently expressed reservations about the plans and said they would only support the move if the bidding price for the lse were not too high . " we favor a solution that would make sense from a businessman 's point of view .
if that is not possible , we would want that the liquid funds be paid out to shareholders , " rolf drees , spokesman for union investment , told the business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deutsche börse spokesperson told reuters over the weekend that the germans would try to win over those shareholders who were not convinced by the plan .
" management and the supervisory board will explain to minority shareholders such as tci why it is worth supporting the bid . " deal floundering over price the shareholder opposition to the proposed deal may ultimately prove to be irrelevant .
last month , deutsche börse put an informal offer of 530 pence per lse share on the table , pricing lse at nearly two billion euros , but the price was dismissed as too low by the london market . lse management then agreed to negotiate further with a view to obtaining a higher price , but appears to be hedging its bets by courting deutsche börse 's arch-rival , euronext in parallel talks . sources up stakes with unofficial deadlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it appears that competition for lse is making the germans jittery .
a deutsche börse supervisory board member reportedly told reuters on sunday that the german company was putting a two to four-week time span on the lse management to back its offer to buy the business . " at this point going hostile is not an option .
deutsche börse wants a deal that is recommended by the lse management .
deutsche börse 's objective is to convince lse 's management over the next two to four weeks .
deutsche börse has the means to increase the bid if they thought fit to do so , " the board member said , adding : " obviously no improved bid is imminent . " however , a deutsche börse spokesman refused to add credence to the statement , saying : " we can not imagine that this information comes from a supervisory board source and we refuse to comment . " if successful , the acquisition of lse by deutsche börse would create the world 's second-largest exchange after new york . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse launches charm offensive in its bid to win over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , german stock market operator deutsche börse appeared to be pulling out all the stops on wednesday to convince its london rival of the virtues of a merger .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .

he also argued that the eu should have less power to take action against countries offending the rules . " the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions , " schröder wrote .
" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu . " schröder said the criteria should not be applied mechanically , but that credible growth and labor policies should allow countries to run higher deficits .
they should be given leeway if they introduced costly structural reforms or were suffering from economic stagnation , schröder wrote .
as an example , he pointed to his own government 's agenda 2010 labor market and tax reforms . the chancellor said allowances should also be made for countries shouldering " special economic burdens , " such as germany 's substantial financial transfers to its economically weak east as well its large contributions to the eu budget .
special treatment for germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros germany violated the stability pact for the third time in a row with its 2004 budget , which once more tipped the 3 percent deficit limit .
but it has n't been punished for its breaches . " we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't just designed for germany , but is valid for all the countries of the eurozone .
one country ca n't just say that its suffering exceptionally from it , " economist thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- , told dw-tv . since the euro has been able to hold its own , the rules should n't be softened , straubhaar said of the stability pact .
" otherwise , one should go ahead and bury it . " euro-zone finance ministers are set to meet in brussels monday evening to for two days of talks that will focus on changes to the stability pact . german finance minister hans eichel said monday he was hopeful that the eu would agree on changes to the euro rules in time for a european union summit in march .

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country .

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .

but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .

but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .

he also argued that the eu should have less power to take action against countries offending the rules . " the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions , " schröder wrote .
" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu .

he also argued that the eu should have less power to take action against countries offending the rules . " the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions , " schröder wrote .
" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu . " schröder said the criteria should not be applied mechanically , but that credible growth and labor policies should allow countries to run higher deficits .
they should be given leeway if they introduced costly structural reforms or were suffering from economic stagnation , schröder wrote .
as an example , he pointed to his own government 's agenda 2010 labor market and tax reforms . the chancellor said allowances should also be made for countries shouldering " special economic burdens , " such as germany 's substantial financial transfers to its economically weak east as well its large contributions to the eu budget .
special treatment for germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros germany violated the stability pact for the third time in a row with its 2004 budget , which once more tipped the 3 percent deficit limit .
but it has n't been punished for its breaches . " we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't just designed for germany , but is valid for all the countries of the eurozone .
one country ca n't just say that its suffering exceptionally from it , " economist thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- , told dw-tv . since the euro has been able to hold its own , the rules should n't be softened , straubhaar said of the stability pact .
" otherwise , one should go ahead and bury it . " euro-zone finance ministers are set to meet in brussels monday evening to for two days of talks that will focus on changes to the stability pact . german finance minister hans eichel said monday he was hopeful that the eu would agree on changes to the euro rules in time for a european union summit in march .
he said he expected the 3 percent deficit limit to be retained . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and scientists also want to know if the equivalence principle holds for everything .
that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !
hundreds of years after galileo , the equivalence principle still holds – even for atoms .
and it has big implications for the way we see the universe .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and scientists also want to know if the equivalence principle holds for everything .
that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !
hundreds of years after galileo , the equivalence principle still holds – even for atoms .
and it has big implications for the way we see the universe .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .

a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .

naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "

einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .
he moved to princeton , new jersey , where he worked at the institute for advanced study at princeton university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of a younger einstein a committed pacifist , albert einstein lobbied for a single world government .
in the area of peace and conflict studies , einstein 's positions are still current , said thomas held of the german foundation for peace studies .
einstein had spent a good deal of time contemplating what a political means to peace might be .
" he was n't a pure pacifist , " said held .
einstein had also thought about the limits of civilian means toward peacekeeping , and had asked himself when the military would need to intervene .
thus einstein , fearing the germans would build atomic weapons , wrote a letter to then us president franklin d. roosevelt recommending the americans build an atom bomb .
it was a recommendation he later regretted .
bildunterschrift : einstein 's summer house in caputh , near potsdam on berlin 's southwest side .
the year of einstein will be celebrated with exhibits , international conferences , the reopening of einstein 's summer house near potsdam , and many other events related to the physicist .
the activities will be sponsored by , among others , the max planck institute and the einstein forum .
dw-tv is starting the year of einstein with a 12 part series .
every 14 days , the science program " tomorrow today " will have specials on einstein 's theories ; the first is on the relativity of time , others will focus on topics like the speed of light . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racing down einstein ’ s paths who are the researchers who are continuing to develop einstein ’ s theories ?

the results are exciting , entertaining and fascinating .
nuclear medicine : a formula and its results when an atom in a radioactive element decays , then part of the matter that makes up its nucleus is transformed into energy .
this is part of the proof that backs up einstein ’ s realization that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin .
einstein : linking mass and energy einstein once admitted that he didn ’ t know whether " god is laughing and leading me around by the nose “ , but his special theory of relativity soon became accepted by scientists everywhere .

if they -lrb- deutsche börse -rrb- were purely motivated by shareholder interests , they would put the acquisition to a vote , " said david slager , who manages atticus capital 's european fund , in remarks to the financial times . gathering voices of opposition atticus is the second major shareholder to publicly oppose the takeover plans .
british investment fund tci fund management llp -lrb- tci -rrb- , which says it holds around five percent of deutsche börse , voiced its opposition to the project on saturday . a tci statement similarly requested that an extraordinary shareholders meeting be held to vote on the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should instead buy back its own shares .
tci added that such a vote should also consider the possibility of replacing the german company 's entire supervisory board . german shareholders have also voiced their opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2005 calls for eu ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ban the offensive symbols throughout europe several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering . prince harry , who went to a costume party dressed in an afrika korps uniform with a swastika armband , " really lacked taste , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of neo-nazis celebrate during a rally in the eastern german city of leipzig , friday , may 1 , 1998 .
bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .

bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .
he moved to princeton , new jersey , where he worked at the institute for advanced study at princeton university .

in the area of peace and conflict studies , einstein 's positions are still current , said thomas held of the german foundation for peace studies .
einstein had spent a good deal of time contemplating what a political means to peace might be .
" he was n't a pure pacifist , " said held .
einstein had also thought about the limits of civilian means toward peacekeeping , and had asked himself when the military would need to intervene .

we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .

good thinking !

but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2005 calls for eu ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ban the offensive symbols throughout europe several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering . prince harry , who went to a costume party dressed in an afrika korps uniform with a swastika armband , " really lacked taste , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of neo-nazis celebrate during a rally in the eastern german city of leipzig , friday , may 1 , 1998 .
bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and scientists also want to know if the equivalence principle holds for everything .
that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !

he also argued that the eu should have less power to take action against countries offending the rules . " the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions , " schröder wrote .
" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu .

but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2005 calls for eu ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ban the offensive symbols throughout europe several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering . prince harry , who went to a costume party dressed in an afrika korps uniform with a swastika armband , " really lacked taste , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of neo-nazis celebrate during a rally in the eastern german city of leipzig , friday , may 1 , 1998 .
bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and scientists also want to know if the equivalence principle holds for everything .
that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !
hundreds of years after galileo , the equivalence principle still holds – even for atoms .
and it has big implications for the way we see the universe .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

" in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2005 calls for eu ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ban the offensive symbols throughout europe several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering . prince harry , who went to a costume party dressed in an afrika korps uniform with a swastika armband , " really lacked taste , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of neo-nazis celebrate during a rally in the eastern german city of leipzig , friday , may 1 , 1998 .
bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.01.2005 germany considers expanding dna testing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moshammer 's killer was arrested based on dna evidence a quickly solved high-profile murder case has led some german politicians to call for more dna testing .
but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .
above all , germany must set legal conditions for obligatory widespread genetic testing , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's your daddy ?
father 's rights groups in germany are fighting to retain their right to have secret paternity tests without a mother 's permission .
they say it is the only way to combat " paternity fraud . "

but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .
above all , germany must set legal conditions for obligatory widespread genetic testing , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's your daddy ?

however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .
above all , germany must set legal conditions for obligatory widespread genetic testing , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's your daddy ?

" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .
above all , germany must set legal conditions for obligatory widespread genetic testing , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's your daddy ?

earlier , the leader of the opposition cdu party , angela merkel , had supported the idea of the governing spd-green coalition to take legal action against politicians who were secretly receiving extra income from companies .
green party fraction leader katrin göring-eckardt had said that all rules would only make sense when appropriate sanctions were levied against politicians with undisclosed income .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and scientists also want to know if the equivalence principle holds for everything .
that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !
hundreds of years after galileo , the equivalence principle still holds – even for atoms .
and it has big implications for the way we see the universe .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and scientists also want to know if the equivalence principle holds for everything .
that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !
hundreds of years after galileo , the equivalence principle still holds – even for atoms .
and it has big implications for the way we see the universe .

" with our combined strength we will muck out this pig-sty , " dvu chief gerhard frey , told a congress in munich in southern germany . npd chief promises to shake up opposition meanwhile , npd boss udo voigt declared that the combined force of the two parties would shake the mainstream parties to their core and that the far-right 's election campaigns would be such that the opposition would be unable to believe their eyes or ears .
he gave no further details but offered a belligerent warning to those who wished to oppose them by force . " we will no longer be the whipping-boys of the left , " said voigt .
" whoever attacks us , should expect to get hurt , " he said after listing various attacks on far right supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leftist demonstrations against the far-right have turned violent in recent times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.01.2005 shareholders oppose deutsche börse 's lse plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future owners of the london stock exchange remain unknown deutsche börse , the company which runs the frankfurt stock exchange , is facing shareholder opposition in its proposed takeover of the london stock exchange . the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange 's proposed takeover of its british-based rival was thrown into further doubt on monday when the us-based hedge fund atticus capital became the latest major deutsche börse shareholder to voice opposition to the planned € 1.85 billion -lrb- $ 2.43 billion -rrb- buy-out of the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- . atticus , which controls roughly two percent of deutsche börse , wants the german company , which also owns the derivatives market eurex and the clearing firm clearstream , to buy back its own shares rather than buy the lse . " the acquisition appears to us to be motivated by empire-building .
if they -lrb- deutsche börse -rrb- were purely motivated by shareholder interests , they would put the acquisition to a vote , " said david slager , who manages atticus capital 's european fund , in remarks to the financial times . gathering voices of opposition atticus is the second major shareholder to publicly oppose the takeover plans .
british investment fund tci fund management llp -lrb- tci -rrb- , which says it holds around five percent of deutsche börse , voiced its opposition to the project on saturday . a tci statement similarly requested that an extraordinary shareholders meeting be held to vote on the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should instead buy back its own shares .
tci added that such a vote should also consider the possibility of replacing the german company 's entire supervisory board . german shareholders have also voiced their opposition .
union investment recently expressed reservations about the plans and said they would only support the move if the bidding price for the lse were not too high . " we favor a solution that would make sense from a businessman 's point of view .
if that is not possible , we would want that the liquid funds be paid out to shareholders , " rolf drees , spokesman for union investment , told the business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deutsche börse spokesperson told reuters over the weekend that the germans would try to win over those shareholders who were not convinced by the plan .
" management and the supervisory board will explain to minority shareholders such as tci why it is worth supporting the bid . " deal floundering over price the shareholder opposition to the proposed deal may ultimately prove to be irrelevant .
last month , deutsche börse put an informal offer of 530 pence per lse share on the table , pricing lse at nearly two billion euros , but the price was dismissed as too low by the london market . lse management then agreed to negotiate further with a view to obtaining a higher price , but appears to be hedging its bets by courting deutsche börse 's arch-rival , euronext in parallel talks . sources up stakes with unofficial deadlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it appears that competition for lse is making the germans jittery .
a deutsche börse supervisory board member reportedly told reuters on sunday that the german company was putting a two to four-week time span on the lse management to back its offer to buy the business . " at this point going hostile is not an option .
deutsche börse wants a deal that is recommended by the lse management .
deutsche börse 's objective is to convince lse 's management over the next two to four weeks .
deutsche börse has the means to increase the bid if they thought fit to do so , " the board member said , adding : " obviously no improved bid is imminent . " however , a deutsche börse spokesman refused to add credence to the statement , saying : " we can not imagine that this information comes from a supervisory board source and we refuse to comment . " if successful , the acquisition of lse by deutsche börse would create the world 's second-largest exchange after new york . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse launches charm offensive in its bid to win over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , german stock market operator deutsche börse appeared to be pulling out all the stops on wednesday to convince its london rival of the virtues of a merger .

if they -lrb- deutsche börse -rrb- were purely motivated by shareholder interests , they would put the acquisition to a vote , " said david slager , who manages atticus capital 's european fund , in remarks to the financial times . gathering voices of opposition atticus is the second major shareholder to publicly oppose the takeover plans .
british investment fund tci fund management llp -lrb- tci -rrb- , which says it holds around five percent of deutsche börse , voiced its opposition to the project on saturday . a tci statement similarly requested that an extraordinary shareholders meeting be held to vote on the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should instead buy back its own shares .
tci added that such a vote should also consider the possibility of replacing the german company 's entire supervisory board . german shareholders have also voiced their opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.01.2005 remembering einstein 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants science to be more accessible to the public chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death . in front of 800 german and international guests , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday officially opened the year of einstein , germany 's tribute to its most famous scientist .
schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .
he moved to princeton , new jersey , where he worked at the institute for advanced study at princeton university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of a younger einstein a committed pacifist , albert einstein lobbied for a single world government .
in the area of peace and conflict studies , einstein 's positions are still current , said thomas held of the german foundation for peace studies .
einstein had spent a good deal of time contemplating what a political means to peace might be .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .

numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .

bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .
he moved to princeton , new jersey , where he worked at the institute for advanced study at princeton university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of a younger einstein a committed pacifist , albert einstein lobbied for a single world government .
in the area of peace and conflict studies , einstein 's positions are still current , said thomas held of the german foundation for peace studies .
einstein had spent a good deal of time contemplating what a political means to peace might be .
" he was n't a pure pacifist , " said held .
einstein had also thought about the limits of civilian means toward peacekeeping , and had asked himself when the military would need to intervene .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .
he moved to princeton , new jersey , where he worked at the institute for advanced study at princeton university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of a younger einstein a committed pacifist , albert einstein lobbied for a single world government .
in the area of peace and conflict studies , einstein 's positions are still current , said thomas held of the german foundation for peace studies .
einstein had spent a good deal of time contemplating what a political means to peace might be .
" he was n't a pure pacifist , " said held .
einstein had also thought about the limits of civilian means toward peacekeeping , and had asked himself when the military would need to intervene .
thus einstein , fearing the germans would build atomic weapons , wrote a letter to then us president franklin d. roosevelt recommending the americans build an atom bomb .
it was a recommendation he later regretted .
bildunterschrift : einstein 's summer house in caputh , near potsdam on berlin 's southwest side .
the year of einstein will be celebrated with exhibits , international conferences , the reopening of einstein 's summer house near potsdam , and many other events related to the physicist .
the activities will be sponsored by , among others , the max planck institute and the einstein forum .
dw-tv is starting the year of einstein with a 12 part series .
every 14 days , the science program " tomorrow today " will have specials on einstein 's theories ; the first is on the relativity of time , others will focus on topics like the speed of light . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racing down einstein ’ s paths who are the researchers who are continuing to develop einstein ’ s theories ?

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and scientists also want to know if the equivalence principle holds for everything .
that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !
hundreds of years after galileo , the equivalence principle still holds – even for atoms .
and it has big implications for the way we see the universe .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.01.2005 remembering einstein 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants science to be more accessible to the public chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death . in front of 800 german and international guests , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday officially opened the year of einstein , germany 's tribute to its most famous scientist .
schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .
he moved to princeton , new jersey , where he worked at the institute for advanced study at princeton university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of a younger einstein a committed pacifist , albert einstein lobbied for a single world government .
in the area of peace and conflict studies , einstein 's positions are still current , said thomas held of the german foundation for peace studies .
einstein had spent a good deal of time contemplating what a political means to peace might be .
" he was n't a pure pacifist , " said held .
einstein had also thought about the limits of civilian means toward peacekeeping , and had asked himself when the military would need to intervene .
thus einstein , fearing the germans would build atomic weapons , wrote a letter to then us president franklin d. roosevelt recommending the americans build an atom bomb .
it was a recommendation he later regretted .
bildunterschrift : einstein 's summer house in caputh , near potsdam on berlin 's southwest side .
the year of einstein will be celebrated with exhibits , international conferences , the reopening of einstein 's summer house near potsdam , and many other events related to the physicist .
the activities will be sponsored by , among others , the max planck institute and the einstein forum .
dw-tv is starting the year of einstein with a 12 part series .
every 14 days , the science program " tomorrow today " will have specials on einstein 's theories ; the first is on the relativity of time , others will focus on topics like the speed of light . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de racing down einstein ’ s paths who are the researchers who are continuing to develop einstein ’ s theories ?

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .
he moved to princeton , new jersey , where he worked at the institute for advanced study at princeton university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of a younger einstein a committed pacifist , albert einstein lobbied for a single world government .
in the area of peace and conflict studies , einstein 's positions are still current , said thomas held of the german foundation for peace studies .
einstein had spent a good deal of time contemplating what a political means to peace might be .
" he was n't a pure pacifist , " said held .
einstein had also thought about the limits of civilian means toward peacekeeping , and had asked himself when the military would need to intervene .
thus einstein , fearing the germans would build atomic weapons , wrote a letter to then us president franklin d. roosevelt recommending the americans build an atom bomb .
it was a recommendation he later regretted .
bildunterschrift : einstein 's summer house in caputh , near potsdam on berlin 's southwest side .
the year of einstein will be celebrated with exhibits , international conferences , the reopening of einstein 's summer house near potsdam , and many other events related to the physicist .
the activities will be sponsored by , among others , the max planck institute and the einstein forum .
dw-tv is starting the year of einstein with a 12 part series .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.01.2005 germany considers expanding dna testing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moshammer 's killer was arrested based on dna evidence a quickly solved high-profile murder case has led some german politicians to call for more dna testing .
but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .
above all , germany must set legal conditions for obligatory widespread genetic testing , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's your daddy ?

" the acquisition appears to us to be motivated by empire-building .
if they -lrb- deutsche börse -rrb- were purely motivated by shareholder interests , they would put the acquisition to a vote , " said david slager , who manages atticus capital 's european fund , in remarks to the financial times . gathering voices of opposition atticus is the second major shareholder to publicly oppose the takeover plans .
british investment fund tci fund management llp -lrb- tci -rrb- , which says it holds around five percent of deutsche börse , voiced its opposition to the project on saturday . a tci statement similarly requested that an extraordinary shareholders meeting be held to vote on the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should instead buy back its own shares .
tci added that such a vote should also consider the possibility of replacing the german company 's entire supervisory board . german shareholders have also voiced their opposition .
union investment recently expressed reservations about the plans and said they would only support the move if the bidding price for the lse were not too high . " we favor a solution that would make sense from a businessman 's point of view .
if that is not possible , we would want that the liquid funds be paid out to shareholders , " rolf drees , spokesman for union investment , told the business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deutsche börse spokesperson told reuters over the weekend that the germans would try to win over those shareholders who were not convinced by the plan .
" management and the supervisory board will explain to minority shareholders such as tci why it is worth supporting the bid . " deal floundering over price the shareholder opposition to the proposed deal may ultimately prove to be irrelevant .
last month , deutsche börse put an informal offer of 530 pence per lse share on the table , pricing lse at nearly two billion euros , but the price was dismissed as too low by the london market . lse management then agreed to negotiate further with a view to obtaining a higher price , but appears to be hedging its bets by courting deutsche börse 's arch-rival , euronext in parallel talks . sources up stakes with unofficial deadlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it appears that competition for lse is making the germans jittery .
a deutsche börse supervisory board member reportedly told reuters on sunday that the german company was putting a two to four-week time span on the lse management to back its offer to buy the business . " at this point going hostile is not an option .
deutsche börse wants a deal that is recommended by the lse management .
deutsche börse 's objective is to convince lse 's management over the next two to four weeks .
deutsche börse has the means to increase the bid if they thought fit to do so , " the board member said , adding : " obviously no improved bid is imminent . " however , a deutsche börse spokesman refused to add credence to the statement , saying : " we can not imagine that this information comes from a supervisory board source and we refuse to comment . " if successful , the acquisition of lse by deutsche börse would create the world 's second-largest exchange after new york . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse launches charm offensive in its bid to win over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , german stock market operator deutsche börse appeared to be pulling out all the stops on wednesday to convince its london rival of the virtues of a merger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2005 calls for eu ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ban the offensive symbols throughout europe several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering . prince harry , who went to a costume party dressed in an afrika korps uniform with a swastika armband , " really lacked taste , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of neo-nazis celebrate during a rally in the eastern german city of leipzig , friday , may 1 , 1998 .
bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2005 calls for eu ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ban the offensive symbols throughout europe several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering . prince harry , who went to a costume party dressed in an afrika korps uniform with a swastika armband , " really lacked taste , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of neo-nazis celebrate during a rally in the eastern german city of leipzig , friday , may 1 , 1998 .
bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

" the acquisition appears to us to be motivated by empire-building .
if they -lrb- deutsche börse -rrb- were purely motivated by shareholder interests , they would put the acquisition to a vote , " said david slager , who manages atticus capital 's european fund , in remarks to the financial times . gathering voices of opposition atticus is the second major shareholder to publicly oppose the takeover plans .
british investment fund tci fund management llp -lrb- tci -rrb- , which says it holds around five percent of deutsche börse , voiced its opposition to the project on saturday . a tci statement similarly requested that an extraordinary shareholders meeting be held to vote on the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should instead buy back its own shares .
tci added that such a vote should also consider the possibility of replacing the german company 's entire supervisory board . german shareholders have also voiced their opposition .
union investment recently expressed reservations about the plans and said they would only support the move if the bidding price for the lse were not too high . " we favor a solution that would make sense from a businessman 's point of view .
if that is not possible , we would want that the liquid funds be paid out to shareholders , " rolf drees , spokesman for union investment , told the business daily handelsblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deutsche börse spokesperson told reuters over the weekend that the germans would try to win over those shareholders who were not convinced by the plan .
" management and the supervisory board will explain to minority shareholders such as tci why it is worth supporting the bid . " deal floundering over price the shareholder opposition to the proposed deal may ultimately prove to be irrelevant .
last month , deutsche börse put an informal offer of 530 pence per lse share on the table , pricing lse at nearly two billion euros , but the price was dismissed as too low by the london market . lse management then agreed to negotiate further with a view to obtaining a higher price , but appears to be hedging its bets by courting deutsche börse 's arch-rival , euronext in parallel talks . sources up stakes with unofficial deadlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it appears that competition for lse is making the germans jittery .
a deutsche börse supervisory board member reportedly told reuters on sunday that the german company was putting a two to four-week time span on the lse management to back its offer to buy the business . " at this point going hostile is not an option .
deutsche börse wants a deal that is recommended by the lse management .
deutsche börse 's objective is to convince lse 's management over the next two to four weeks .
deutsche börse has the means to increase the bid if they thought fit to do so , " the board member said , adding : " obviously no improved bid is imminent . " however , a deutsche börse spokesman refused to add credence to the statement , saying : " we can not imagine that this information comes from a supervisory board source and we refuse to comment . " if successful , the acquisition of lse by deutsche börse would create the world 's second-largest exchange after new york . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse launches charm offensive in its bid to win over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , german stock market operator deutsche börse appeared to be pulling out all the stops on wednesday to convince its london rival of the virtues of a merger .

but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2005 calls for eu ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ban the offensive symbols throughout europe several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering . prince harry , who went to a costume party dressed in an afrika korps uniform with a swastika armband , " really lacked taste , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of neo-nazis celebrate during a rally in the eastern german city of leipzig , friday , may 1 , 1998 .
bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .

that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !
hundreds of years after galileo , the equivalence principle still holds – even for atoms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2005 calls for eu ban on nazi symbols großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to ban the offensive symbols throughout europe several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering . prince harry , who went to a costume party dressed in an afrika korps uniform with a swastika armband , " really lacked taste , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy leader of germany 's conservative christian democratic parliamentary group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of neo-nazis celebrate during a rally in the eastern german city of leipzig , friday , may 1 , 1998 .
bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .
he moved to princeton , new jersey , where he worked at the institute for advanced study at princeton university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of a younger einstein a committed pacifist , albert einstein lobbied for a single world government .
in the area of peace and conflict studies , einstein 's positions are still current , said thomas held of the german foundation for peace studies .
einstein had spent a good deal of time contemplating what a political means to peace might be .
" he was n't a pure pacifist , " said held .
einstein had also thought about the limits of civilian means toward peacekeeping , and had asked himself when the military would need to intervene .
thus einstein , fearing the germans would build atomic weapons , wrote a letter to then us president franklin d. roosevelt recommending the americans build an atom bomb .
it was a recommendation he later regretted .
bildunterschrift : einstein 's summer house in caputh , near potsdam on berlin 's southwest side .
the year of einstein will be celebrated with exhibits , international conferences , the reopening of einstein 's summer house near potsdam , and many other events related to the physicist .
the activities will be sponsored by , among others , the max planck institute and the einstein forum .
dw-tv is starting the year of einstein with a 12 part series .

we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .

he also argued that the eu should have less power to take action against countries offending the rules . " the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions , " schröder wrote .
" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu . " schröder said the criteria should not be applied mechanically , but that credible growth and labor policies should allow countries to run higher deficits .
they should be given leeway if they introduced costly structural reforms or were suffering from economic stagnation , schröder wrote .
as an example , he pointed to his own government 's agenda 2010 labor market and tax reforms . the chancellor said allowances should also be made for countries shouldering " special economic burdens , " such as germany 's substantial financial transfers to its economically weak east as well its large contributions to the eu budget .

one country ca n't just say that its suffering exceptionally from it , " economist thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- , told dw-tv . since the euro has been able to hold its own , the rules should n't be softened , straubhaar said of the stability pact .
" otherwise , one should go ahead and bury it . " euro-zone finance ministers are set to meet in brussels monday evening to for two days of talks that will focus on changes to the stability pact . german finance minister hans eichel said monday he was hopeful that the eu would agree on changes to the euro rules in time for a european union summit in march .

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.01.2005 germany considers expanding dna testing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moshammer 's killer was arrested based on dna evidence a quickly solved high-profile murder case has led some german politicians to call for more dna testing .
but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .
above all , germany must set legal conditions for obligatory widespread genetic testing , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's your daddy ?

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and scientists also want to know if the equivalence principle holds for everything .
that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !
hundreds of years after galileo , the equivalence principle still holds – even for atoms .
and it has big implications for the way we see the universe .

but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .
above all , germany must set legal conditions for obligatory widespread genetic testing , he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who 's your daddy ?

" mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters .

in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .
good thinking !
the object with the parachute will certainly fall slower .
but that ’ s wind resistance – the gravitational acceleration is the same . -rrb-
the equivalence principle is a principle , not a theory .
that means it ’ s not something you can prove .
you can only observe it over and over again .
for hundreds of years , scientists have been dropping all kinds of things , from all kinds of heights , to double- and triple- and gadzoople-check the equivalence principle .
and gravity always accelerated them the same .
no one ever measured a difference .
but scientists are curious people , and they still want to know just exactly how exactly exact the equivalence principle is .
some of them guess that , actually , chemical composition does have an very small effect on gravitational acceleration .
so nasa scientists have an experiment where they shoot lasers at the moon , where they hit mirrors that astronauts put up there 30 years ago , and measure how long the lasers take to reflect back to earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and scientists also want to know if the equivalence principle holds for everything .
that ’ s where dr. sebastian fray comes in .
he ’ s at the max planck institute for quantum optics in garching , germany .
and his team has been measuring if the equivalence principle doesn ’ t just hold for candy , water balloons , and 100 euro bills , but for little strange things like atoms as well .
it turns out , it does !
hundreds of years after galileo , the equivalence principle still holds – even for atoms .
and it has big implications for the way we see the universe .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president .

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united .

" we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 .

sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

" i thank everybody who voted for me as well as all those who cast ballots .
i am proud of the maturity of croatia 's democracy , " mesic said in a victory speech early monday , immediately after the official results were announced .
" today croatia is marching with big steps towards europe .
now we have to be united and have a national consensus to achieve our goals .
we can do it only if we are united . " mesic , 70 , has pledged to lead the balkan country of some 4.4 million people into the eu before the end of the decade , a major prize for a country that was ravaged by a brutal inter-ethnic war only 10 years ago after it split from the yugoslav federation . " we have traveled a long way and croatia 's democracy has been confirmed .
the world can see that and that 's why we 're standing at the doorsteps of europe , " said mesic , a centrist politician who ran in the election as an independent . not ready for a female president ? kosor , a 51-year-old former radio journalist and the first woman to make the second round of a croatian presidential race , congratulated mesic and also praised hdz supporters and her party chief , prime minister ivo sanader -lrb- photo -rrb- , for his support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatian prime minister ivo sanader " i thank prime minister sanader for having the courage to put forward a woman as a candidate of the biggest and most historic croatian party , " she told supporters at hdz headquarters . " i 'm proud to have maintained a high level of dialogue in my campaign .
i have not spoken badly of my rivals .
in the runoff i did not accept a dialogue of disqualifications , which was sometimes below any acceptable level . "
sanader conceded defeat for the conservatives late sunday after exit polls showed mesic had an unassailable lead .
but he insisted the result was not a blow for the hdz , the former nationalist party which he has transformed into a mainstream conservative force since he was elected prime minister in november 2003 . " in this election we showed that the hdz has a permanent , strong and loyal constituency , " he said , adding : " maybe the time has not yet come for croatia to have a woman president . " in the first round on january 2 , mesic won 48.92 percent of the vote , just short of the 50 percent necessary to avoid a runoff and well ahead of kosor 's 20.3 percent . tudjman 's heirs while kosor is a relative newcomer to croatian politics , mesic was able to campaign on his first-term record of democratic reform and improved international relations following the isolation of his hardline nationalist predecessor , hdz founder franjo tudjman . eu leaders last month said they would open accession talks with croatia in march , but they warned that progress hinged on the transfer of war crimes indictee ante gotovina to the un tribunal at the hague .
sanader insists that gotovina , a former general who remains a hero to many croats , is no longer in the country , and mesic said during the election campaign that zagreb merely had to prove to brussels that it was " doing everything " to find him . mesic , who has the backing of the three main opposition parties , also reminded voters of the autocratic rule of tudjman , who died in 1999 , and warned against giving too much power to one party . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing croatian skepticism about eu croatia 's government is hoping to secure a date for accession talks when european union leaders huddle for their winter summit in brussels next thursday despite signs of growing euroskepticism at home .

but opponents say they still worry about privacy issues . following the quick arrest of the confessed killer of german tabloid personality rudolph moshammer , several german politicians and top law-enforcement officials have come out in favor of increased dna testing .
however , other politicians - notably some from the green and neo-liberal free democrat parties - have stuck to their arguments that broader dna testing could infringe on civil rights .
according to current law , dna testing can only be used in serious felonies and sex offenses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich fashion czar rudolph moshammer was killed last week within days of the death of german clothing designer and media figure rudolph moshammer , police arrested a 25-year-old iraqi who confessed to the killing .
the quick resolution was due to dna tracing , since the federal criminal police already had the suspect 's " genetic fingerprint " in their database .
the suspect had previously given a voluntary saliva specimen during an earlier , unrelated investigation .
' red-green blockade ' bavarian prime minister edmund stoiber came out in favor of widening the use of dna testing , saying he hopes it will become the 21st century 's most decisive investigation tool .
" dna analysis means criminals can no longer get off without paying for their crime , " stoiber said .
the christian democratic union has long been in favor more dna testing , hamburg justice minister roger kusch noted .
" for years , the union has been in favor of increasing the use of this important instrument in crime fighting , " he told news agencies monday .
but until now , all attempts have run up against the " red-green blockade " and the " pseudo-argument of data protection , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing dna the moshammer case seems to have unleashed a great deal of support for more dna testing , sometimes from unexpected quarters .
key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .

key politicians from the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , came out in favor of more testing on monday , including social democrat spokesman dieter wiefelspütz .
wiefelspütz told news agencies that he was " in favor of taking and storing dna whenever the police record someone 's data . "
police want dna databank and fritz behrens -lrb- spd -rrb- , interior minister of north rhine westfalia , told the rheinische post newspaper : " dna analysis must be a standard of police record keeping , like fingerprinting . "
top law enforcement officials also used the moshammer case to stress the importance of keeping a databank of dna samples , saying " genetic fingerprinting " has replaced classic fingerprinting in terms of its value .
konrad freiberg , head of germany 's policemen 's association , told the netzeitung internet newspaper : " the encroachment of genetic testing on civil rights is no greater than that of the classic fingerprint or the identification photograph . "
breach of privacy ?
he added , " the more genetic fingerprints from suspected criminals we have on register , the more crimes will be solved . "
but several green party officials have voiced their opposition to more testing .
jerzy montag , legal expert for the greens , warned against abusing the dna analysis .
" the apprehension of the criminal -lrb- in the moshammer case -rrb- took place according to the law , and proves that there is no hole in the current law , " he said .
" dna analysis is an excellent investigative tool - and also a serious intrusion of the basic rights of german law , as it applies to privacy and data protection , " he said .
thus there needs to be an " intelligent solution " to using the technology , he argued .
green party spokesman volker beck also opposed the tests .
dna tests can bring other personal information , such as illnesses , to light , he said .
because of the potential dangers of exposing this information , the bar must remain high for collecting and storing dna data , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday .
free democrat party spokesman max stadler also told the berliner zeitung he was opposed to raising dna analysis to the same level as other investigative techniques .

he also argued that the eu should have less power to take action against countries offending the rules . " the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions , " schröder wrote .
" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu . " schröder said the criteria should not be applied mechanically , but that credible growth and labor policies should allow countries to run higher deficits .
they should be given leeway if they introduced costly structural reforms or were suffering from economic stagnation , schröder wrote .
as an example , he pointed to his own government 's agenda 2010 labor market and tax reforms . the chancellor said allowances should also be made for countries shouldering " special economic burdens , " such as germany 's substantial financial transfers to its economically weak east as well its large contributions to the eu budget .
special treatment for germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euros germany violated the stability pact for the third time in a row with its 2004 budget , which once more tipped the 3 percent deficit limit .
but it has n't been punished for its breaches . " we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't just designed for germany , but is valid for all the countries of the eurozone .
one country ca n't just say that its suffering exceptionally from it , " economist thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- , told dw-tv . since the euro has been able to hold its own , the rules should n't be softened , straubhaar said of the stability pact .
" otherwise , one should go ahead and bury it . " euro-zone finance ministers are set to meet in brussels monday evening to for two days of talks that will focus on changes to the stability pact . german finance minister hans eichel said monday he was hopeful that the eu would agree on changes to the euro rules in time for a european union summit in march .
he said he expected the 3 percent deficit limit to be retained . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

please don ’ t do it , unless you are a sixteenth-century scientific genius , like galileo galilei .
-lrb- or if you happen to have 100 euros , and i ’ m right underneath you .
just don ’ t let the guard see us . -rrb-
we don ’ t know if galileo actually did drop anything from the leaning tower of pisa .
but he certainly fantasised something like that .
like in the picture above .
galileo wanted to show something called the universality of free fall , aka the " equivalence principle " .
it says if you drop two things from the same height , then , regardless of how much they weigh or what they 're made of , they 'll hit the ground at the same time .
more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .
you can drop two of the same plastic bags , one full of rock candy and the other full of gummy bears , and they 'll hit the ground at the exact same time .
or a cannonball and a styrofoam ball .
or a water balloon , and a bigger water balloon .
-lrb- but you ’ re probably thinking , what if one of them has a parachute .

more technically put , " gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate , regardless of their mass or composition . "
that 's right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.01.2005 remembering einstein 's legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants science to be more accessible to the public chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death . in front of 800 german and international guests , chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday officially opened the year of einstein , germany 's tribute to its most famous scientist .
schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "

if they -lrb- deutsche börse -rrb- were purely motivated by shareholder interests , they would put the acquisition to a vote , " said david slager , who manages atticus capital 's european fund , in remarks to the financial times . gathering voices of opposition atticus is the second major shareholder to publicly oppose the takeover plans .
british investment fund tci fund management llp -lrb- tci -rrb- , which says it holds around five percent of deutsche börse , voiced its opposition to the project on saturday . a tci statement similarly requested that an extraordinary shareholders meeting be held to vote on the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should instead buy back its own shares .
tci added that such a vote should also consider the possibility of replacing the german company 's entire supervisory board . german shareholders have also voiced their opposition .

last month , deutsche börse put an informal offer of 530 pence per lse share on the table , pricing lse at nearly two billion euros , but the price was dismissed as too low by the london market . lse management then agreed to negotiate further with a view to obtaining a higher price , but appears to be hedging its bets by courting deutsche börse 's arch-rival , euronext in parallel talks . sources up stakes with unofficial deadlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it appears that competition for lse is making the germans jittery .

schröder , who last year made innovation and new technology one of his government 's policy focus , said germany should create a " culture of science " that would create an atmosphere of technological advancement and risk-taking .
he also said researchers should more readily share their knowledge and make it understandable to the general public and hard-to-reach audiences , such as schoolchildren .
the chancellor 's speech in the german historical museum in berlin kicked off a year-long tribute to einstein , who died 50 years ago this year .
exhibits , cultural events and lectures on the man , his radical theories and his life in germany before fleeing the nazis in the 1932 will dominate the program .
featured prominently will be his general theory of relativity , which turns 100 this year .
e = mc ² enabled physicists to make predictions about the curvature of space through large masses and also the description of an expanding universe long before the theory of a big bang was established .
it also has been one of the world 's most enduring scientific lessons , even resonating with people who do n't know the first thing about physics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein writes out an equation for the density of the milky way a science revolution " through albert einstein 's work , humankind 's horizons expanded endlessly , and at the same time our image of the universe has reached a harmony and intimacy that people could only have dreamed of until then , " danish nobel prize-winning physicist niels bohr once said .
bildunterschrift : people step over a carpet bearing einstein quotes , made to mark the 100th anniversary of the theory of relativity christoph lehner , a historian at the max planck institute for the history of science in berlin , called einstein 's theories " millennial occasions . "
numerous circumstances had to come together in order for him to have made the discoveries , lehner said .
a certain amount of irreverence on einstein 's part was needed .
" einstein was an extremely independent thinker .
he absolutely refused to believe in authority , " lehner said .
this was an extremely important characteristic for his work , since he had to break with deep traditions for his work .
einstein 's own explanation for his creativity does n't sound anything like genius .
normal adults do n't think about the problem of time and space , he once said .
" that 's above all the work of children .
i , on the other hand , developed so very slowly that i first started to think about space and time as an adult .
naturally , i got deeper into the problem than an average child . "
physicist and pacifist but the nobel prize winner had more on his mind than just questions of physics .
einstein fled germany under the nazi regime in 1932 , never again to set foot on german soil .
he moved to princeton , new jersey , where he worked at the institute for advanced study at princeton university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a portrait of a younger einstein a committed pacifist , albert einstein lobbied for a single world government .
in the area of peace and conflict studies , einstein 's positions are still current , said thomas held of the german foundation for peace studies .
einstein had spent a good deal of time contemplating what a political means to peace might be .
" he was n't a pure pacifist , " said held .
einstein had also thought about the limits of civilian means toward peacekeeping , and had asked himself when the military would need to intervene .
thus einstein , fearing the germans would build atomic weapons , wrote a letter to then us president franklin d. roosevelt recommending the americans build an atom bomb .
it was a recommendation he later regretted .
bildunterschrift : einstein 's summer house in caputh , near potsdam on berlin 's southwest side .
the year of einstein will be celebrated with exhibits , international conferences , the reopening of einstein 's summer house near potsdam , and many other events related to the physicist .
the activities will be sponsored by , among others , the max planck institute and the einstein forum .
dw-tv is starting the year of einstein with a 12 part series .
every 14 days , the science program " tomorrow today " will have specials on einstein 's theories ; the first is on the relativity of time , others will focus on topics like the speed of light . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : racing down einstein ’ s paths who are the researchers who are continuing to develop einstein ’ s theories ?

bosbach said it was possible european justice ministers at an upcoming meeting would discuss bringing in a european prohibition on displaying the swastika and other nazi signs .
these already are banned in germany , which nonetheless has a worrying problem of xenophobic neo-nazi activities , particularly in the former communist east of the country . " all of europe has suffered in the past because of the crimes of the nazis , therefore it would be logical for nazi symbols to be banned all over europe , " added silvana koch-merin , who heads germany 's liberal free democrats in the european parliament .
she also called for the question of a ban to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of justice ministers . the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , michael müller , agreed that study was needed to find out how a german-style anti-nazi law could be transposed to the rest of europe .
dieter wiefelspütz , a social democratic party specialist on justice questions , said nazi symbols were reminders of a " humiliating " and " deathly " concept of humanity . eu ban unlikely but expanding the ban on nazi symbols across the eu is unlikely to happen , as many countries consider their display - no matter how repugnant - protected by democratic principles of free speech . backers of a ban want the issue rushed onto the agenda of a european union ministers ' meeting next week .
but the emotive issue generated immediate dispute , with some warning that it threatens freedom of expression .
" i understand how the burden of history weighs upon my german colleagues ' view , " said chris davies , leader of the british liberal democrats in the european parliament .
" however , banning symbols can not ban evil and risks playing into the hands of those who would seek to subvert the very liberties we most champion , " he added .
a spokesman for eu home affairs commissioner franco frattini said he " shares the general feeling of opprobrium at the use of the swastika and other nazi symbols " .
" it may be worth looking into the possibility of a europe-wide ban , to explore that possibility at least , " he added . harry 's gaffe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince harry has since apologized for his inappropriate choice of costume prince harry recently attended a fancy dress ball with the theme of " colonials and natives " dressed as a german afrika corps officer , apparently unaware despite years of education at one of britain 's most expensive schools , that the world is about to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp . his grandmother , queen elizabeth , is also due to host a reception for survivors of the holocaust before representing the nation at the holocaust memorial day national event . the wayward price has offered a written apology saying his choice of costume had been unfortunate .
however , the gaffe has outraged jewish groups including the simon wiesenthal center , which called the incident " a shameful act … displaying insensitivity " to both holocaust victims and allied soldiers " who gave their lives to defeat nazism .

the online survey also found that sir sean connery was the " most pleasant speaker " followed closely by ewan mcgregor and billy connolly .
in the uk as a whole , 54 % said they were happy with the way they spoke , while 73 % of respondents from scotland said they were proud of their accent .
the poll is part of a bbc project into the english language .
over the coming months , bbc voices project staff will record the spoken words of at least 1,000 interviewees from throughout the uk .
they will also aim to encourage at least 10,000 people to " have their say " on the bbc voices online survey .
what we want to unearth is real language and how it affects real people dr clive upton leeds university project director , mick ord , said : " we are combining bbc journalism and story telling with academic input and rigour to bring to life in an accessible and entertaining way a linguistic blueprint for britain .
" the challenge between now and august will be to turn the raw material into content . "
but first the bbc wants to hear what people think of the survey findings by logging their views on the official voices website or by phoning 0800 0566787 .
the uk sample as a whole ranked the scottish accent in general , and the edinburgh accent in particular , highly in terms of pleasantness , prestige and helpfulness in getting ahead in the jobs market .
however , the glasgow accent was ranked lowly in each case , being considered only more pleasant than the liverpool , asian , german , black country and birmingham accents .
there were 550 respondents who took part in the poll from scotland , which represents 11 % of those interviewed .
some of the comments included : " it is an accent called orcadian , it comes from the norse .
it 's a very lilting accent .
almost a singing accent . "
" shetlandic dialect with scottish undertones , perhaps gemanic and norwegian gutteral sounds , nasal , quite rapid when excited . "
" i do not regard myself as speaking english .
i am scottish and proud of my accent . "
" i have a scottish accent , i probably sound very broad scottish but i 'm not .
i cringe when i hear scottish accents on the tv .
everyone 's different i suppose . "
" smooth scottish accent which is soft and gentle not harsh like glaswegian ! "
" well i 'm scottish and proud of it and i never think of being english .
being scottish means that you are something that no-one else can be . "
the bbc project aims to contribute to updating the university of leeds ' survey of english dialects .
it is thought to be the first methodical and scientific attempt to map the accents and the special local idiosyncrasies in the language .
it will also provide content for an online interactive dialect map of the british isles .
the audio interviews will also be logged with the national sound archive at the british library and sound archives in scotland , wales and northern ireland .
' i 'm not going nowhere ' linguistics expert , dr clive upton , from leeds university , said : " scratch the surface and language can create huge debate .
" we are passionate about it because it 's about our identity who we are and where we are from .
" what we want to unearth is real language and how it affects real people .
" for example who is to say that non-standard english , phrases like ' i 'm not going nowhere , ' is substandard english .
this goes back to shakespeare and beyond . "
bbc audience and consumer research commissioned the poll of 5,010 respondents , which was undertaken by greenfield online between 17 and 26 november .

" we are passionate about it because it 's about our identity who we are and where we are from .
" what we want to unearth is real language and how it affects real people .
" for example who is to say that non-standard english , phrases like ' i 'm not going nowhere , ' is substandard english .
this goes back to shakespeare and beyond . "

sports minister patricia ferguson claimed the games would create millions of pounds for scotland from tourism .
she is due to tell a conference : " scotland stands shoulder to shoulder with london in its bid to host the olympics in 2012 . "
nationalists have argued that london would get gold from a successful bid , while scotland would be an also-ran .
the scottish nationalist party 's alex neil , convener of holyrood 's enterprise committee , said : " we 've already had the dome .
scotland 's share of that was £ 100m and this is dome mark two .
" it is us subsidising london , which has got three times the population of scotland and is far , far wealthier than scotland .
why should we subsidise london ?
" the danger for scotland is we could be robbed of something like £ 70m worth of lottery and other funding . "
mr neil added : " the fact of life is we 're going to get nowhere near £ 70m , but we are going to see our local sports clubs and other good causes going down the tube because there 's not going to be the lottery money there to sustain them . "
support for mr neil came from independent msp margo macdonald .
" my concern is that in getting the games so much money will have to be spent that the money that should be going into development of sport in scotland will have to be cut by £ 10m , " she said .
" that 's far too much money for us to lose . "
however , ms ferguson said : " i think the opportunity of a successful bid for the whole of scotland is immense .
" there are enormous spin-offs for us both culturally and in terms of sport and tourism .
but it 's up to us to maximise these benefits . "
ms ferguson added : " the scottish government does n't want to see money being diverted from good causes so we 're working very hard to make sure that does n't happen and if there is any kind of diversion , that is minimised as far we possibly can . "
in october , a london olympic bid chief urged scotland 's nationalist politicians to get behind the campaign to bring the games to london in 2012 .
mike lee 's plea came after polls indicated that people north of the border were less supportive than those in the rest of the uk .
mr lee , communications director of the london bid , said : " the national figures would be much higher if you took out scotland .
the levels of support in scotland are not great . "
and alastair dempster , chairman of sportscotland , said : " i wish to make it quite clear that sportscotland , and i believe scottish sport as a whole , is fully behind london 's bid to bring the olympic games to the uk in 2012 . "

more than 100 people came forward after fire service bosses said 17 of oxfordshire 's 24 stations were in dire need of more part-time personnel .
they said the appeal had been a success because of coverage in the media .
but they warned that there was still a " desperate need " for the retained firefighters across the county .
' crisis not over ' the ongoing shortage , caused by people moving out of the area and retirements , means appliances can not be manned locally and response times are slower .
john farrow , the county council 's executive member for community safety , said : " the crisis is n't over yet .
" we are still in desperate need of retained firefighters in deddington , watlington , wallingford , woodstock and bampton so i would like to encourage anyone living in those areas to think about applying and making a difference to their community . "
the service is looking to raise the current number of retained firefighters from 304 to 350 .
the county has six stations crewed by a mix of retained and full-time firefighters and 18 with just retained crews .

mr schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3 % limit if they met certain criteria .
writing in the financial times , mr schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms .
changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in march .
exemptions needed the current eu rules limit the size of a eurozone country 's deficit to 3 % of gdp .
countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the european commission , although several countries , including germany , have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment .
the european commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules . "
the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions is only permitted under very limited conditions " gerhard schroeder mr schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions .
" the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions , " he wrote .
" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu . "
cost of reform deficits should be allowed to rise above 3 % , mr schroeder argued , if countries meet several " mandatory criteria " .
these include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms , countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering " special economic burdens " .
the proposed changes would make it harder for the european commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact 's rules .
mr schroeder 's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 eurozone finance ministers on monday to discuss the pact .
the issue will also be discussed at tuesday 's ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 eu members .
mr schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact .
a number of eu finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone 's rules .

mr schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3 % limit if they met certain criteria .
writing in the financial times , mr schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms .
changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in march .
exemptions needed the current eu rules limit the size of a eurozone country 's deficit to 3 % of gdp .
countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the european commission , although several countries , including germany , have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment .
the european commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules .
the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions is only permitted under very limited conditions gerhard schroeder mr schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions .
" the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions , " he wrote .
" only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu . "
cost of reform deficits should be allowed to rise above 3 % , mr schroeder argued , if countries meet several " mandatory criteria " .
these include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms , countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering " special economic burdens " .
the proposed changes would make it harder for the european commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact 's rules .
mr schroeder 's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 eurozone finance ministers on monday to discuss the pact .
the issue will also be discussed at tuesday 's ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 eu members .

the environment agency said the shingle accumulates because of natural coastal processes , but the build-up will block the river unless it is moved .
sussex area flood defence manager andrew gilham said the work would be carried out in daylight during low tide , as in previous years .
" during winter months , the threat of flooding is never far away , " he said .
what is certain is that forecast rises in sea level will mean that the current maintenance regime is untenable andrew gilham " it is crucial that these works take place before the shingle has a chance to block the river .
" although the cuckmere valley is mainly rural , there are isolated properties that are at risk of flooding if the river is unable to discharge to sea . "
he said the agency was continuing to look at options for the long-term management of the valley and further technical studies are taking place .
" what is certain is that forecast rises in sea level will mean that the current maintenance regime is untenable . "
plan opposed the environment agency has put forward plans which would see the valley , created by the victorians in 1846 , turned into a salt marsh and nature reserve .
residents living near the valley have been fighting the scheme since 2003 .
people living nearby announced last year they were submitting their own planning application for the area , to build defences which would keep the valley in its current state .
they say the agency 's plan will destroy wildlife , footpaths and parts of the local beach .
