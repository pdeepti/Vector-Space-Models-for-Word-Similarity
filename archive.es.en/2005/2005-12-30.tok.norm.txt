"
" the meeting of the gas supply group will enable the -lrb- european -rrb- commission to establish the situation on the ground with respect to longer term issues and to discuss the appropriate european response , " the commission said in a statement . in the latest development in the feud , russian state-controlled gas giant gazprom rejected earlier friday a last-ditch appeal from ukraine for the extension of a deadline to pay four times as much for russian natural gas or have supplies cut off from sunday . gazprom , which holds a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 185-194 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of gas , up from the current price of $ 50 , from the start of 2006 . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly . alarm bells ringing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas giant gazprom chief alexei miller alarm bells are ringing in the eu , which depends on russia to supply about a quarter of its gas needs , because to cut off ukraine , gazprom will simply reduce the amount of gas running through the main pipeline that serves both ukraine and europe . " the commission is concerned , but remains confident that an agreement will be reached between the parties and that both russia and ukraine will honor their commitments to supply european gas markets as they have at all times in the past , " it added . gazprom 's chief alexei miller has said the company had a " detailed plan of measures " to guarantee eu supplies . nevertheless , if kiev compensates for its lost share by dipping into the gas destined for europe that could result in a deficit further down the line . cold weather causing concern the commission was " confident " that the dispute would not lead to a shortage just as demand spikes in europe on account of cold winter weather . " even if a limited part of european supplies were to be interrupted , given the level of gas stocks and supplies from other areas , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission is confident that this would not cause a gas shortage in europe in the short term , " it said . about a quarter of the eu 's gas supply comes from russia , and most of that transits through a pipeline in ukraine although an alternate route exists through belarus . the dispute has highlighted europe 's growing dependency on foreign natural gas , especially from russia . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .

how much influence will moscow really have ? the world 's most elite club faces a critical test starting sunday as russia takes the helm of the g8 for the first time , determined to prove it belongs despite stark differences with fellow members on basic issues ranging from democracy to iran 's nuclear program . the russian presidency of the group of eight top industrialized nations will also be a milestone for president vladimir putin , whose two terms in the kremlin have focused on restoring russia , humbled by the collapse of the soviet union , to the league of big powers . ' russia can not set the agenda ' but political analysts say his success is under question since moscow 's turn in the g8 driver 's seat has limited symbolic value and no practical benefit for russia . " little of what the g-8 does actually depends on russia , " yury korgunyuk , of the indem policy think tank in moscow , told afp news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in canada dressed up in papier mache heads of g-8 leaders " the presidency works by rotation , so there is nothing special in this .
it 's like saying ' we 'll have the meeting at your house today ' , but the practical agenda is worked out jointly .
russia can not set the g8 agenda by itself . " putin will play host to his fellow g8 leaders at a summit next july in his hometown of saint petersburg , determined to make a more solid transition from being the g8 's " poor relation " to being treated as a full member of the family . from beneficiary to contributor the promotion , analysts say , would involve huge expenditures on global g8 projects in fields like third world poverty reduction , environmental clean-up and weapons reduction programs - projects that moscow is more accustomed to being a beneficiary of rather than a contributor to . still by far the poorest of the world 's " rich " countries , the merits of russia 's membership in the g8 are still seriously questioned by many in the west and moscow admits itself it is not close to joining the club of group of seven finance ministers that controls the group 's purse strings . controversy over stifled ngos russia also faces criticism from other g8 governments over its political course under putin , which critics have characterized as a rollback of democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin has been criticized for stifling dissent on wednesday , a leading international human rights organization , human rights watch , said it wanted to see g8 leaders discuss controversial draft legislation imposing tighter controls on domestic and foreign non-governmental organizations operating in russia . ngos claim he new laws harm democratic development in russia ; the tighter controls could mean silencing one of the last remaining means of government criticism in the country .
putin has since intervened and ordered the bill toned down , but ngos called the move too little , too late . moscow meanwhile remains at odds with washington and three european g8 members over iran 's nuclear program .
while the west fears it is a cover for the islamic state to develop nuclear arms , russia disagrees and is continuing to help iran build its first nuclear power station . ' real influence ' over energy but while differences between russia and the other g8 members abound , they also converge in key areas - chief among them energy supplies , which russia possesses in vast quantities .
putin has said he will place " energy security " at the top of the g8 agenda during russia 's presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil production gives the country its clout " russia could have some real influence in this area , " korgunyuk said .
" it is the only net oil exporter among the g8 countries . " the g8 comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us .
russia 's path to the g8 presidency was long and difficult .
in 1992 , the then-g7 rejected the us proposal to make russia a full member .
for a while the phrase " g7 + 1 " was used to describe the group , when russia was included in discussion of a limited scope of g7 topics . yet even as part of the g8 , russia still is n't fully integrated .
it is not part of the group of seven finance ministers , excluded because of doubts about its economy , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
and russia claims to be in no hurry to join the finance ministers group . focus on kyoto despite its uncertain status , russia has big plans for the g8 presidency .
topping the agenda is energy policy . putin has also said he will push for a debt-relief program for the poor states of the ex-soviet union - especially in central asia .
and moscow said it also wants to see decisions made on putting the rules of the kyoto protocol into effect .
russia is a signatory to the kyoto accord , which aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions . " it is important to work with the countries that have yet to sign the treaty , " putin has frequently said .
the us and australia have refused to sign the treaty . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the appointment and said it is a sign that the united nations recognizes germany 's peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts in afghanistan . koenigs new job wo n't be his first at the un .
he headed the un verification mission in guatemala as a special representative for the secretary general .
the mission was established to monitor the peace agreement signed in 1996 between the former parties in the civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom koenigs has vast experience in war-ravaged countries the 61-year-old also played a key role for the united nations in kosovo from 1999 to 2002 where he was responsible for the general civil administration .
despite the extremely difficult situation in strife-ridden kosovo , koenigs remained pragmatic while trying to get the province back on its feet . " we would n't be here if there were n't huge problems so we should n't be surprised that there ’ s a lot of work to do , " he said at the time .
" everything from providing energy to education needs to be dealt with .
but despite this , the people here are optimistic and helping with the reconciliation process is worth it no matter how slow the process is . "
since january he has been germany 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid . warlords , taliban , opium trade await since crucial un-sponsored talks in bonn four years ago , afghanistan has held presidential elections and sworn in a new parliament .
but koenig 's predecessor in afghanistan has said much still needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has enjoyed a taste of democracy in recent months " the bonn process has moved forward fairly well ...
and frankly political change has taken place and the fact that that has not been accompanied by a decrease in a level of violence poses a certain question , " arnaud said .
" we should all sit down , the government of afghanistan and the international committee and look more closely at these questions . " koenigs will assume his new post in february , at a critical time for afghanistan .
the government is coming into its own , but the country is wracked by instability and experiences frequent attacks from ousted taliban militants .
the opium trade continues to thrive despite international efforts to quell it , and pressure is high to eradicate the opium poppy fields that provide most of western europe with its heroin . germany has played a major role in helping bring stability to afghanistan .
of the roughly 9,000 foreign troops that make up the nato-led international security assistance force , around 2,500 are german . despite the continuing need for peacekeepers , the relatively successful and peaceful parliamentary elections in september have given observers hope that the country could be on its way to stability . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's afghan job still important , still dangerous almost 2,000 german soldiers will move from kabul to northern afghanistan , leaving 500 in the capital , defense minister jung said on thursday .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .
-lrb- dec .
21 , 2005 -rrb- schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror . "
-lrb- dec.16 , 2005 -rrb- german ministers deny involvement in cia affair during bundestag hearings on wednesday , the german government denied any involvement in the alleged cia abductions of suspected terrorists , but not all parliamentarians were convinced .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .

bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the appointment and said it is a sign that the united nations recognizes germany 's peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts in afghanistan . koenigs new job wo n't be his first at the un .
he headed the un verification mission in guatemala as a special representative for the secretary general .
the mission was established to monitor the peace agreement signed in 1996 between the former parties in the civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom koenigs has vast experience in war-ravaged countries the 61-year-old also played a key role for the united nations in kosovo from 1999 to 2002 where he was responsible for the general civil administration .
despite the extremely difficult situation in strife-ridden kosovo , koenigs remained pragmatic while trying to get the province back on its feet . " we would n't be here if there were n't huge problems so we should n't be surprised that there ’ s a lot of work to do , " he said at the time .
" everything from providing energy to education needs to be dealt with .
but despite this , the people here are optimistic and helping with the reconciliation process is worth it no matter how slow the process is . "
since january he has been germany 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid . warlords , taliban , opium trade await since crucial un-sponsored talks in bonn four years ago , afghanistan has held presidential elections and sworn in a new parliament .
but koenig 's predecessor in afghanistan has said much still needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has enjoyed a taste of democracy in recent months " the bonn process has moved forward fairly well ...
and frankly political change has taken place and the fact that that has not been accompanied by a decrease in a level of violence poses a certain question , " arnaud said .
" we should all sit down , the government of afghanistan and the international committee and look more closely at these questions . " koenigs will assume his new post in february , at a critical time for afghanistan .
the government is coming into its own , but the country is wracked by instability and experiences frequent attacks from ousted taliban militants .
the opium trade continues to thrive despite international efforts to quell it , and pressure is high to eradicate the opium poppy fields that provide most of western europe with its heroin . germany has played a major role in helping bring stability to afghanistan .
of the roughly 9,000 foreign troops that make up the nato-led international security assistance force , around 2,500 are german . despite the continuing need for peacekeepers , the relatively successful and peaceful parliamentary elections in september have given observers hope that the country could be on its way to stability . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's afghan job still important , still dangerous almost 2,000 german soldiers will move from kabul to northern afghanistan , leaving 500 in the capital , defense minister jung said on thursday .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.12.2005 hsv challenge bayern 's pulling power in pursuit of podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's germany striker lukas podolski is a man much in demand germany striker lukas podolski looked destined to leave his beloved cologne for bayern munich in 2006 .
but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the appointment and said it is a sign that the united nations recognizes germany 's peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts in afghanistan . koenigs new job wo n't be his first at the un .
he headed the un verification mission in guatemala as a special representative for the secretary general .
the mission was established to monitor the peace agreement signed in 1996 between the former parties in the civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom koenigs has vast experience in war-ravaged countries the 61-year-old also played a key role for the united nations in kosovo from 1999 to 2002 where he was responsible for the general civil administration .
despite the extremely difficult situation in strife-ridden kosovo , koenigs remained pragmatic while trying to get the province back on its feet . " we would n't be here if there were n't huge problems so we should n't be surprised that there ’ s a lot of work to do , " he said at the time .
" everything from providing energy to education needs to be dealt with .
but despite this , the people here are optimistic and helping with the reconciliation process is worth it no matter how slow the process is . "
since january he has been germany 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid . warlords , taliban , opium trade await since crucial un-sponsored talks in bonn four years ago , afghanistan has held presidential elections and sworn in a new parliament .
but koenig 's predecessor in afghanistan has said much still needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has enjoyed a taste of democracy in recent months " the bonn process has moved forward fairly well ...
and frankly political change has taken place and the fact that that has not been accompanied by a decrease in a level of violence poses a certain question , " arnaud said .
" we should all sit down , the government of afghanistan and the international committee and look more closely at these questions . " koenigs will assume his new post in february , at a critical time for afghanistan .
the government is coming into its own , but the country is wracked by instability and experiences frequent attacks from ousted taliban militants .
the opium trade continues to thrive despite international efforts to quell it , and pressure is high to eradicate the opium poppy fields that provide most of western europe with its heroin . germany has played a major role in helping bring stability to afghanistan .
of the roughly 9,000 foreign troops that make up the nato-led international security assistance force , around 2,500 are german . despite the continuing need for peacekeepers , the relatively successful and peaceful parliamentary elections in september have given observers hope that the country could be on its way to stability . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's afghan job still important , still dangerous almost 2,000 german soldiers will move from kabul to northern afghanistan , leaving 500 in the capital , defense minister jung said on thursday .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

21 , 2005 -rrb- schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror . "
-lrb- dec.16 , 2005 -rrb- german ministers deny involvement in cia affair during bundestag hearings on wednesday , the german government denied any involvement in the alleged cia abductions of suspected terrorists , but not all parliamentarians were convinced .

" the commission is concerned , but remains confident that an agreement will be reached between the parties and that both russia and ukraine will honor their commitments to supply european gas markets as they have at all times in the past , " it added . gazprom 's chief alexei miller has said the company had a " detailed plan of measures " to guarantee eu supplies . nevertheless , if kiev compensates for its lost share by dipping into the gas destined for europe that could result in a deficit further down the line . cold weather causing concern the commission was " confident " that the dispute would not lead to a shortage just as demand spikes in europe on account of cold winter weather . " even if a limited part of european supplies were to be interrupted , given the level of gas stocks and supplies from other areas , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission is confident that this would not cause a gas shortage in europe in the short term , " it said . about a quarter of the eu 's gas supply comes from russia , and most of that transits through a pipeline in ukraine although an alternate route exists through belarus . the dispute has highlighted europe 's growing dependency on foreign natural gas , especially from russia . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.12.2005 germany 's koenigs appointed un 's afghan representative großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koenig 's appointment is seen as recognition of germany 's role in afghanistan united nations secretary general kofi annan has appointed germany ’ s tom koenigs as his special representative for afghanistan and head of the assistance mission . the green party politician replaces french diplomat jean arnault , who 's held the post since february 2004 .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the appointment and said it is a sign that the united nations recognizes germany 's peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts in afghanistan . koenigs new job wo n't be his first at the un .
he headed the un verification mission in guatemala as a special representative for the secretary general .
the mission was established to monitor the peace agreement signed in 1996 between the former parties in the civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom koenigs has vast experience in war-ravaged countries the 61-year-old also played a key role for the united nations in kosovo from 1999 to 2002 where he was responsible for the general civil administration .
despite the extremely difficult situation in strife-ridden kosovo , koenigs remained pragmatic while trying to get the province back on its feet . " we would n't be here if there were n't huge problems so we should n't be surprised that there ’ s a lot of work to do , " he said at the time .
" everything from providing energy to education needs to be dealt with .
but despite this , the people here are optimistic and helping with the reconciliation process is worth it no matter how slow the process is . "
since january he has been germany 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid . warlords , taliban , opium trade await since crucial un-sponsored talks in bonn four years ago , afghanistan has held presidential elections and sworn in a new parliament .
but koenig 's predecessor in afghanistan has said much still needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has enjoyed a taste of democracy in recent months " the bonn process has moved forward fairly well ...
and frankly political change has taken place and the fact that that has not been accompanied by a decrease in a level of violence poses a certain question , " arnaud said .
" we should all sit down , the government of afghanistan and the international committee and look more closely at these questions . " koenigs will assume his new post in february , at a critical time for afghanistan .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .
the agent did say , however , that the talks had not gone as far as discussing a transfer fee or personal terms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi could still join best mate schweini -lrb- center -rrb- at bayern this will alert bayern who will consider hsv 's announcement as a direct challenge to its superiority in the german transfer market and which should prompt much serenading and waving of check books .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .
in that way , the polish-born striker might consider hamburg a better club as he would be a guaranteed starter up front for hsv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a german hero , poldi could be one of a new breed of hsv stars there may also be more of a challenge at hsv .
while bayern could tempt him with domestic league and cup titles , and possibly a better chance of european glory , hamburg are a team on the up and it could be more attractive prospect to a young and hungry player to be part of bringing the good times back to one of germany 's oldest clubs . striker could favor challenge to bring glory days back success has mostly eluded hamburg since the team 's 1983 european cup win , a 1987 german cup win aside , but hsv is still considered a huge team in germany despite that . however , it has been a while since the club has enjoyed the pulling power necessary to bring the big names to the aol arena .
the signing of dutch star rafael van der vaart in 2005 may have been the catalyst for the club 's current title-challenging form but it could also pave the way for future high profile signings , such as podolski , and a return to the glory days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .
the agent did say , however , that the talks had not gone as far as discussing a transfer fee or personal terms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi could still join best mate schweini -lrb- center -rrb- at bayern this will alert bayern who will consider hsv 's announcement as a direct challenge to its superiority in the german transfer market and which should prompt much serenading and waving of check books .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .
in that way , the polish-born striker might consider hamburg a better club as he would be a guaranteed starter up front for hsv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a german hero , poldi could be one of a new breed of hsv stars there may also be more of a challenge at hsv .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .

europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

21 , 2005 -rrb- schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror . "

how much influence will moscow really have ? the world 's most elite club faces a critical test starting sunday as russia takes the helm of the g8 for the first time , determined to prove it belongs despite stark differences with fellow members on basic issues ranging from democracy to iran 's nuclear program . the russian presidency of the group of eight top industrialized nations will also be a milestone for president vladimir putin , whose two terms in the kremlin have focused on restoring russia , humbled by the collapse of the soviet union , to the league of big powers . ' russia can not set the agenda ' but political analysts say his success is under question since moscow 's turn in the g8 driver 's seat has limited symbolic value and no practical benefit for russia .

it 's like saying ' we 'll have the meeting at your house today ' , but the practical agenda is worked out jointly .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .
the agent did say , however , that the talks had not gone as far as discussing a transfer fee or personal terms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi could still join best mate schweini -lrb- center -rrb- at bayern this will alert bayern who will consider hsv 's announcement as a direct challenge to its superiority in the german transfer market and which should prompt much serenading and waving of check books .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .
in that way , the polish-born striker might consider hamburg a better club as he would be a guaranteed starter up front for hsv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a german hero , poldi could be one of a new breed of hsv stars there may also be more of a challenge at hsv .
while bayern could tempt him with domestic league and cup titles , and possibly a better chance of european glory , hamburg are a team on the up and it could be more attractive prospect to a young and hungry player to be part of bringing the good times back to one of germany 's oldest clubs . striker could favor challenge to bring glory days back success has mostly eluded hamburg since the team 's 1983 european cup win , a 1987 german cup win aside , but hsv is still considered a huge team in germany despite that . however , it has been a while since the club has enjoyed the pulling power necessary to bring the big names to the aol arena .
the signing of dutch star rafael van der vaart in 2005 may have been the catalyst for the club 's current title-challenging form but it could also pave the way for future high profile signings , such as podolski , and a return to the glory days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

how much influence will moscow really have ? the world 's most elite club faces a critical test starting sunday as russia takes the helm of the g8 for the first time , determined to prove it belongs despite stark differences with fellow members on basic issues ranging from democracy to iran 's nuclear program . the russian presidency of the group of eight top industrialized nations will also be a milestone for president vladimir putin , whose two terms in the kremlin have focused on restoring russia , humbled by the collapse of the soviet union , to the league of big powers . ' russia can not set the agenda ' but political analysts say his success is under question since moscow 's turn in the g8 driver 's seat has limited symbolic value and no practical benefit for russia . " little of what the g-8 does actually depends on russia , " yury korgunyuk , of the indem policy think tank in moscow , told afp news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in canada dressed up in papier mache heads of g-8 leaders " the presidency works by rotation , so there is nothing special in this .
it 's like saying ' we 'll have the meeting at your house today ' , but the practical agenda is worked out jointly .
russia can not set the g8 agenda by itself . " putin will play host to his fellow g8 leaders at a summit next july in his hometown of saint petersburg , determined to make a more solid transition from being the g8 's " poor relation " to being treated as a full member of the family . from beneficiary to contributor the promotion , analysts say , would involve huge expenditures on global g8 projects in fields like third world poverty reduction , environmental clean-up and weapons reduction programs - projects that moscow is more accustomed to being a beneficiary of rather than a contributor to . still by far the poorest of the world 's " rich " countries , the merits of russia 's membership in the g8 are still seriously questioned by many in the west and moscow admits itself it is not close to joining the club of group of seven finance ministers that controls the group 's purse strings . controversy over stifled ngos russia also faces criticism from other g8 governments over its political course under putin , which critics have characterized as a rollback of democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin has been criticized for stifling dissent on wednesday , a leading international human rights organization , human rights watch , said it wanted to see g8 leaders discuss controversial draft legislation imposing tighter controls on domestic and foreign non-governmental organizations operating in russia . ngos claim he new laws harm democratic development in russia ; the tighter controls could mean silencing one of the last remaining means of government criticism in the country .
putin has since intervened and ordered the bill toned down , but ngos called the move too little , too late . moscow meanwhile remains at odds with washington and three european g8 members over iran 's nuclear program .
while the west fears it is a cover for the islamic state to develop nuclear arms , russia disagrees and is continuing to help iran build its first nuclear power station . ' real influence ' over energy but while differences between russia and the other g8 members abound , they also converge in key areas - chief among them energy supplies , which russia possesses in vast quantities .
putin has said he will place " energy security " at the top of the g8 agenda during russia 's presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil production gives the country its clout " russia could have some real influence in this area , " korgunyuk said .
" it is the only net oil exporter among the g8 countries . " the g8 comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us .
russia 's path to the g8 presidency was long and difficult .
in 1992 , the then-g7 rejected the us proposal to make russia a full member .
for a while the phrase " g7 + 1 " was used to describe the group , when russia was included in discussion of a limited scope of g7 topics . yet even as part of the g8 , russia still is n't fully integrated .
it is not part of the group of seven finance ministers , excluded because of doubts about its economy , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
and russia claims to be in no hurry to join the finance ministers group . focus on kyoto despite its uncertain status , russia has big plans for the g8 presidency .
topping the agenda is energy policy . putin has also said he will push for a debt-relief program for the poor states of the ex-soviet union - especially in central asia .
and moscow said it also wants to see decisions made on putting the rules of the kyoto protocol into effect .
russia is a signatory to the kyoto accord , which aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions . " it is important to work with the countries that have yet to sign the treaty , " putin has frequently said .

how much influence will moscow really have ? the world 's most elite club faces a critical test starting sunday as russia takes the helm of the g8 for the first time , determined to prove it belongs despite stark differences with fellow members on basic issues ranging from democracy to iran 's nuclear program . the russian presidency of the group of eight top industrialized nations will also be a milestone for president vladimir putin , whose two terms in the kremlin have focused on restoring russia , humbled by the collapse of the soviet union , to the league of big powers . ' russia can not set the agenda ' but political analysts say his success is under question since moscow 's turn in the g8 driver 's seat has limited symbolic value and no practical benefit for russia . " little of what the g-8 does actually depends on russia , " yury korgunyuk , of the indem policy think tank in moscow , told afp news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in canada dressed up in papier mache heads of g-8 leaders " the presidency works by rotation , so there is nothing special in this .
it 's like saying ' we 'll have the meeting at your house today ' , but the practical agenda is worked out jointly .
russia can not set the g8 agenda by itself . " putin will play host to his fellow g8 leaders at a summit next july in his hometown of saint petersburg , determined to make a more solid transition from being the g8 's " poor relation " to being treated as a full member of the family . from beneficiary to contributor the promotion , analysts say , would involve huge expenditures on global g8 projects in fields like third world poverty reduction , environmental clean-up and weapons reduction programs - projects that moscow is more accustomed to being a beneficiary of rather than a contributor to . still by far the poorest of the world 's " rich " countries , the merits of russia 's membership in the g8 are still seriously questioned by many in the west and moscow admits itself it is not close to joining the club of group of seven finance ministers that controls the group 's purse strings . controversy over stifled ngos russia also faces criticism from other g8 governments over its political course under putin , which critics have characterized as a rollback of democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin has been criticized for stifling dissent on wednesday , a leading international human rights organization , human rights watch , said it wanted to see g8 leaders discuss controversial draft legislation imposing tighter controls on domestic and foreign non-governmental organizations operating in russia . ngos claim he new laws harm democratic development in russia ; the tighter controls could mean silencing one of the last remaining means of government criticism in the country .
putin has since intervened and ordered the bill toned down , but ngos called the move too little , too late . moscow meanwhile remains at odds with washington and three european g8 members over iran 's nuclear program .
while the west fears it is a cover for the islamic state to develop nuclear arms , russia disagrees and is continuing to help iran build its first nuclear power station . ' real influence ' over energy but while differences between russia and the other g8 members abound , they also converge in key areas - chief among them energy supplies , which russia possesses in vast quantities .
putin has said he will place " energy security " at the top of the g8 agenda during russia 's presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil production gives the country its clout " russia could have some real influence in this area , " korgunyuk said .
" it is the only net oil exporter among the g8 countries . " the g8 comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us .
russia 's path to the g8 presidency was long and difficult .
in 1992 , the then-g7 rejected the us proposal to make russia a full member .
for a while the phrase " g7 + 1 " was used to describe the group , when russia was included in discussion of a limited scope of g7 topics . yet even as part of the g8 , russia still is n't fully integrated .
it is not part of the group of seven finance ministers , excluded because of doubts about its economy , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
and russia claims to be in no hurry to join the finance ministers group . focus on kyoto despite its uncertain status , russia has big plans for the g8 presidency .
topping the agenda is energy policy . putin has also said he will push for a debt-relief program for the poor states of the ex-soviet union - especially in central asia .
and moscow said it also wants to see decisions made on putting the rules of the kyoto protocol into effect .
russia is a signatory to the kyoto accord , which aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions . " it is important to work with the countries that have yet to sign the treaty , " putin has frequently said .
the us and australia have refused to sign the treaty . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

21 , 2005 -rrb- schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror . "

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

"
" the meeting of the gas supply group will enable the -lrb- european -rrb- commission to establish the situation on the ground with respect to longer term issues and to discuss the appropriate european response , " the commission said in a statement . in the latest development in the feud , russian state-controlled gas giant gazprom rejected earlier friday a last-ditch appeal from ukraine for the extension of a deadline to pay four times as much for russian natural gas or have supplies cut off from sunday . gazprom , which holds a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 185-194 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of gas , up from the current price of $ 50 , from the start of 2006 . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly . alarm bells ringing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas giant gazprom chief alexei miller alarm bells are ringing in the eu , which depends on russia to supply about a quarter of its gas needs , because to cut off ukraine , gazprom will simply reduce the amount of gas running through the main pipeline that serves both ukraine and europe . " the commission is concerned , but remains confident that an agreement will be reached between the parties and that both russia and ukraine will honor their commitments to supply european gas markets as they have at all times in the past , " it added . gazprom 's chief alexei miller has said the company had a " detailed plan of measures " to guarantee eu supplies . nevertheless , if kiev compensates for its lost share by dipping into the gas destined for europe that could result in a deficit further down the line . cold weather causing concern the commission was " confident " that the dispute would not lead to a shortage just as demand spikes in europe on account of cold winter weather . " even if a limited part of european supplies were to be interrupted , given the level of gas stocks and supplies from other areas , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission is confident that this would not cause a gas shortage in europe in the short term , " it said . about a quarter of the eu 's gas supply comes from russia , and most of that transits through a pipeline in ukraine although an alternate route exists through belarus . the dispute has highlighted europe 's growing dependency on foreign natural gas , especially from russia . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the appointment and said it is a sign that the united nations recognizes germany 's peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts in afghanistan . koenigs new job wo n't be his first at the un .
he headed the un verification mission in guatemala as a special representative for the secretary general .
the mission was established to monitor the peace agreement signed in 1996 between the former parties in the civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom koenigs has vast experience in war-ravaged countries the 61-year-old also played a key role for the united nations in kosovo from 1999 to 2002 where he was responsible for the general civil administration .
despite the extremely difficult situation in strife-ridden kosovo , koenigs remained pragmatic while trying to get the province back on its feet . " we would n't be here if there were n't huge problems so we should n't be surprised that there ’ s a lot of work to do , " he said at the time .
" everything from providing energy to education needs to be dealt with .
but despite this , the people here are optimistic and helping with the reconciliation process is worth it no matter how slow the process is . "
since january he has been germany 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid . warlords , taliban , opium trade await since crucial un-sponsored talks in bonn four years ago , afghanistan has held presidential elections and sworn in a new parliament .
but koenig 's predecessor in afghanistan has said much still needs to be done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan has enjoyed a taste of democracy in recent months " the bonn process has moved forward fairly well ...
and frankly political change has taken place and the fact that that has not been accompanied by a decrease in a level of violence poses a certain question , " arnaud said .
" we should all sit down , the government of afghanistan and the international committee and look more closely at these questions . " koenigs will assume his new post in february , at a critical time for afghanistan .
the government is coming into its own , but the country is wracked by instability and experiences frequent attacks from ousted taliban militants .
the opium trade continues to thrive despite international efforts to quell it , and pressure is high to eradicate the opium poppy fields that provide most of western europe with its heroin . germany has played a major role in helping bring stability to afghanistan .
of the roughly 9,000 foreign troops that make up the nato-led international security assistance force , around 2,500 are german . despite the continuing need for peacekeepers , the relatively successful and peaceful parliamentary elections in september have given observers hope that the country could be on its way to stability . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's afghan job still important , still dangerous almost 2,000 german soldiers will move from kabul to northern afghanistan , leaving 500 in the capital , defense minister jung said on thursday .

"
" the meeting of the gas supply group will enable the -lrb- european -rrb- commission to establish the situation on the ground with respect to longer term issues and to discuss the appropriate european response , " the commission said in a statement . in the latest development in the feud , russian state-controlled gas giant gazprom rejected earlier friday a last-ditch appeal from ukraine for the extension of a deadline to pay four times as much for russian natural gas or have supplies cut off from sunday . gazprom , which holds a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 185-194 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of gas , up from the current price of $ 50 , from the start of 2006 . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly . alarm bells ringing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas giant gazprom chief alexei miller alarm bells are ringing in the eu , which depends on russia to supply about a quarter of its gas needs , because to cut off ukraine , gazprom will simply reduce the amount of gas running through the main pipeline that serves both ukraine and europe . " the commission is concerned , but remains confident that an agreement will be reached between the parties and that both russia and ukraine will honor their commitments to supply european gas markets as they have at all times in the past , " it added . gazprom 's chief alexei miller has said the company had a " detailed plan of measures " to guarantee eu supplies . nevertheless , if kiev compensates for its lost share by dipping into the gas destined for europe that could result in a deficit further down the line . cold weather causing concern the commission was " confident " that the dispute would not lead to a shortage just as demand spikes in europe on account of cold winter weather . " even if a limited part of european supplies were to be interrupted , given the level of gas stocks and supplies from other areas , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission is confident that this would not cause a gas shortage in europe in the short term , " it said . about a quarter of the eu 's gas supply comes from russia , and most of that transits through a pipeline in ukraine although an alternate route exists through belarus . the dispute has highlighted europe 's growing dependency on foreign natural gas , especially from russia . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .
-lrb- dec .
21 , 2005 -rrb- schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror . "
-lrb- dec.16 , 2005 -rrb- german ministers deny involvement in cia affair during bundestag hearings on wednesday , the german government denied any involvement in the alleged cia abductions of suspected terrorists , but not all parliamentarians were convinced .

one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

how much influence will moscow really have ? the world 's most elite club faces a critical test starting sunday as russia takes the helm of the g8 for the first time , determined to prove it belongs despite stark differences with fellow members on basic issues ranging from democracy to iran 's nuclear program . the russian presidency of the group of eight top industrialized nations will also be a milestone for president vladimir putin , whose two terms in the kremlin have focused on restoring russia , humbled by the collapse of the soviet union , to the league of big powers . ' russia can not set the agenda ' but political analysts say his success is under question since moscow 's turn in the g8 driver 's seat has limited symbolic value and no practical benefit for russia . " little of what the g-8 does actually depends on russia , " yury korgunyuk , of the indem policy think tank in moscow , told afp news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in canada dressed up in papier mache heads of g-8 leaders " the presidency works by rotation , so there is nothing special in this .
it 's like saying ' we 'll have the meeting at your house today ' , but the practical agenda is worked out jointly .
russia can not set the g8 agenda by itself . " putin will play host to his fellow g8 leaders at a summit next july in his hometown of saint petersburg , determined to make a more solid transition from being the g8 's " poor relation " to being treated as a full member of the family . from beneficiary to contributor the promotion , analysts say , would involve huge expenditures on global g8 projects in fields like third world poverty reduction , environmental clean-up and weapons reduction programs - projects that moscow is more accustomed to being a beneficiary of rather than a contributor to . still by far the poorest of the world 's " rich " countries , the merits of russia 's membership in the g8 are still seriously questioned by many in the west and moscow admits itself it is not close to joining the club of group of seven finance ministers that controls the group 's purse strings . controversy over stifled ngos russia also faces criticism from other g8 governments over its political course under putin , which critics have characterized as a rollback of democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin has been criticized for stifling dissent on wednesday , a leading international human rights organization , human rights watch , said it wanted to see g8 leaders discuss controversial draft legislation imposing tighter controls on domestic and foreign non-governmental organizations operating in russia . ngos claim he new laws harm democratic development in russia ; the tighter controls could mean silencing one of the last remaining means of government criticism in the country .
putin has since intervened and ordered the bill toned down , but ngos called the move too little , too late . moscow meanwhile remains at odds with washington and three european g8 members over iran 's nuclear program .
while the west fears it is a cover for the islamic state to develop nuclear arms , russia disagrees and is continuing to help iran build its first nuclear power station . ' real influence ' over energy but while differences between russia and the other g8 members abound , they also converge in key areas - chief among them energy supplies , which russia possesses in vast quantities .
putin has said he will place " energy security " at the top of the g8 agenda during russia 's presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil production gives the country its clout " russia could have some real influence in this area , " korgunyuk said .
" it is the only net oil exporter among the g8 countries . " the g8 comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us .
russia 's path to the g8 presidency was long and difficult .
in 1992 , the then-g7 rejected the us proposal to make russia a full member .
for a while the phrase " g7 + 1 " was used to describe the group , when russia was included in discussion of a limited scope of g7 topics . yet even as part of the g8 , russia still is n't fully integrated .
it is not part of the group of seven finance ministers , excluded because of doubts about its economy , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
and russia claims to be in no hurry to join the finance ministers group . focus on kyoto despite its uncertain status , russia has big plans for the g8 presidency .
topping the agenda is energy policy . putin has also said he will push for a debt-relief program for the poor states of the ex-soviet union - especially in central asia .
and moscow said it also wants to see decisions made on putting the rules of the kyoto protocol into effect .
russia is a signatory to the kyoto accord , which aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions . " it is important to work with the countries that have yet to sign the treaty , " putin has frequently said .
the us and australia have refused to sign the treaty . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .
the agent did say , however , that the talks had not gone as far as discussing a transfer fee or personal terms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi could still join best mate schweini -lrb- center -rrb- at bayern this will alert bayern who will consider hsv 's announcement as a direct challenge to its superiority in the german transfer market and which should prompt much serenading and waving of check books .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .
in that way , the polish-born striker might consider hamburg a better club as he would be a guaranteed starter up front for hsv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a german hero , poldi could be one of a new breed of hsv stars there may also be more of a challenge at hsv .
while bayern could tempt him with domestic league and cup titles , and possibly a better chance of european glory , hamburg are a team on the up and it could be more attractive prospect to a young and hungry player to be part of bringing the good times back to one of germany 's oldest clubs . striker could favor challenge to bring glory days back success has mostly eluded hamburg since the team 's 1983 european cup win , a 1987 german cup win aside , but hsv is still considered a huge team in germany despite that . however , it has been a while since the club has enjoyed the pulling power necessary to bring the big names to the aol arena .
the signing of dutch star rafael van der vaart in 2005 may have been the catalyst for the club 's current title-challenging form but it could also pave the way for future high profile signings , such as podolski , and a return to the glory days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .
the agent did say , however , that the talks had not gone as far as discussing a transfer fee or personal terms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi could still join best mate schweini -lrb- center -rrb- at bayern this will alert bayern who will consider hsv 's announcement as a direct challenge to its superiority in the german transfer market and which should prompt much serenading and waving of check books .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .
in that way , the polish-born striker might consider hamburg a better club as he would be a guaranteed starter up front for hsv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a german hero , poldi could be one of a new breed of hsv stars there may also be more of a challenge at hsv .
while bayern could tempt him with domestic league and cup titles , and possibly a better chance of european glory , hamburg are a team on the up and it could be more attractive prospect to a young and hungry player to be part of bringing the good times back to one of germany 's oldest clubs . striker could favor challenge to bring glory days back success has mostly eluded hamburg since the team 's 1983 european cup win , a 1987 german cup win aside , but hsv is still considered a huge team in germany despite that . however , it has been a while since the club has enjoyed the pulling power necessary to bring the big names to the aol arena .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .
in the meantime , however , the terrorist threat will not be going away anytime soon . gregg benzow -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : berlin protected a german citizen from cia german police in 2003 shielded a german national suspected of terrorism by the united states from questioning by the cia , according to a newspaper report to be published on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.12.2005 hsv challenge bayern 's pulling power in pursuit of podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's germany striker lukas podolski is a man much in demand germany striker lukas podolski looked destined to leave his beloved cologne for bayern munich in 2006 .
but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .
the agent did say , however , that the talks had not gone as far as discussing a transfer fee or personal terms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi could still join best mate schweini -lrb- center -rrb- at bayern this will alert bayern who will consider hsv 's announcement as a direct challenge to its superiority in the german transfer market and which should prompt much serenading and waving of check books .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .
in that way , the polish-born striker might consider hamburg a better club as he would be a guaranteed starter up front for hsv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a german hero , poldi could be one of a new breed of hsv stars there may also be more of a challenge at hsv .
while bayern could tempt him with domestic league and cup titles , and possibly a better chance of european glory , hamburg are a team on the up and it could be more attractive prospect to a young and hungry player to be part of bringing the good times back to one of germany 's oldest clubs . striker could favor challenge to bring glory days back success has mostly eluded hamburg since the team 's 1983 european cup win , a 1987 german cup win aside , but hsv is still considered a huge team in germany despite that . however , it has been a while since the club has enjoyed the pulling power necessary to bring the big names to the aol arena .
the signing of dutch star rafael van der vaart in 2005 may have been the catalyst for the club 's current title-challenging form but it could also pave the way for future high profile signings , such as podolski , and a return to the glory days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

" the meeting of the gas supply group will enable the -lrb- european -rrb- commission to establish the situation on the ground with respect to longer term issues and to discuss the appropriate european response , " the commission said in a statement . in the latest development in the feud , russian state-controlled gas giant gazprom rejected earlier friday a last-ditch appeal from ukraine for the extension of a deadline to pay four times as much for russian natural gas or have supplies cut off from sunday . gazprom , which holds a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 185-194 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of gas , up from the current price of $ 50 , from the start of 2006 . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly . alarm bells ringing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas giant gazprom chief alexei miller alarm bells are ringing in the eu , which depends on russia to supply about a quarter of its gas needs , because to cut off ukraine , gazprom will simply reduce the amount of gas running through the main pipeline that serves both ukraine and europe . " the commission is concerned , but remains confident that an agreement will be reached between the parties and that both russia and ukraine will honor their commitments to supply european gas markets as they have at all times in the past , " it added . gazprom 's chief alexei miller has said the company had a " detailed plan of measures " to guarantee eu supplies . nevertheless , if kiev compensates for its lost share by dipping into the gas destined for europe that could result in a deficit further down the line . cold weather causing concern the commission was " confident " that the dispute would not lead to a shortage just as demand spikes in europe on account of cold winter weather . " even if a limited part of european supplies were to be interrupted , given the level of gas stocks and supplies from other areas , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission is confident that this would not cause a gas shortage in europe in the short term , " it said . about a quarter of the eu 's gas supply comes from russia , and most of that transits through a pipeline in ukraine although an alternate route exists through belarus . the dispute has highlighted europe 's growing dependency on foreign natural gas , especially from russia . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.12.2005 hsv challenge bayern 's pulling power in pursuit of podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's germany striker lukas podolski is a man much in demand germany striker lukas podolski looked destined to leave his beloved cologne for bayern munich in 2006 .
but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .
the agent did say , however , that the talks had not gone as far as discussing a transfer fee or personal terms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi could still join best mate schweini -lrb- center -rrb- at bayern this will alert bayern who will consider hsv 's announcement as a direct challenge to its superiority in the german transfer market and which should prompt much serenading and waving of check books .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .
in that way , the polish-born striker might consider hamburg a better club as he would be a guaranteed starter up front for hsv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a german hero , poldi could be one of a new breed of hsv stars there may also be more of a challenge at hsv .
while bayern could tempt him with domestic league and cup titles , and possibly a better chance of european glory , hamburg are a team on the up and it could be more attractive prospect to a young and hungry player to be part of bringing the good times back to one of germany 's oldest clubs . striker could favor challenge to bring glory days back success has mostly eluded hamburg since the team 's 1983 european cup win , a 1987 german cup win aside , but hsv is still considered a huge team in germany despite that . however , it has been a while since the club has enjoyed the pulling power necessary to bring the big names to the aol arena .
the signing of dutch star rafael van der vaart in 2005 may have been the catalyst for the club 's current title-challenging form but it could also pave the way for future high profile signings , such as podolski , and a return to the glory days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .
both wins came despite mediocre performances from star striker lukas podolski .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .
the agent did say , however , that the talks had not gone as far as discussing a transfer fee or personal terms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi could still join best mate schweini -lrb- center -rrb- at bayern this will alert bayern who will consider hsv 's announcement as a direct challenge to its superiority in the german transfer market and which should prompt much serenading and waving of check books .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .
in that way , the polish-born striker might consider hamburg a better club as he would be a guaranteed starter up front for hsv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a german hero , poldi could be one of a new breed of hsv stars there may also be more of a challenge at hsv .
while bayern could tempt him with domestic league and cup titles , and possibly a better chance of european glory , hamburg are a team on the up and it could be more attractive prospect to a young and hungry player to be part of bringing the good times back to one of germany 's oldest clubs . striker could favor challenge to bring glory days back success has mostly eluded hamburg since the team 's 1983 european cup win , a 1987 german cup win aside , but hsv is still considered a huge team in germany despite that . however , it has been a while since the club has enjoyed the pulling power necessary to bring the big names to the aol arena .

but after admitting their interest in the player , hamburg officials hope to snatch poldi from his southern suitors . the power brokers at bayern munich are used to getting their own way in almost every aspect of german soccer , be it fashioning a team that can dominate the bundesliga or creating a marketing monster capable of getting the club 's crest on everything from toilet paper to thongs . but the club 's hegemony in german soccer may be put to the test in its pursuit of one of germany 's most sought-after young talents . in the summer of 2005 , it was almost a given that fc cologne 's lukas podolski was heading south to the german champions after the world cup in 2006 .
after a string of impressive performances for the national team in which he has scored 10 goals in 20 starts , prince poldi made it clear that , if he were to abdicate his throne , it would be to become a bayern player although he refused to speculate when . however , the striker 's future may in fact lie in the north .
at the end of last season , it would have been laughable to suggest that sv hamburg could be a serious challenger to the german champions in securing high profile signings , let alone challenge bayern for the title . title challengers want podolski but after a mediocre season last term , hamburg are in dogged pursuit of bayern in the league and , if hamburg 's sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer can be believed , are also as determined to sign podolski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants to get their hands on lukas podolski " we want to sign him -lrb- podolski -rrb- this summer , " beiersdorfer told the hamburger morgenpost .
we have met podolski , said that we would love to have him and told him about the prospects here .
we have enough sporting class to make it worthwhile for podolski to consider what is the right step for him , " beiersdorf said . it is a statement that underlines the team 's current ambition and one that suggests that it is far from fanciful to suggest poldi could be pulling on the white shirt of hsv rather than the red of munich in the near future . poldi 's agent admits discussions with hsv the 20-year-old fc cologne forward has a contract at the ruhr club until 2007 , although the player 's agent kon schramm has admitted that he and the player had already spoken to representatives from hamburg in november over an eventual move .
the agent did say , however , that the talks had not gone as far as discussing a transfer fee or personal terms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi could still join best mate schweini -lrb- center -rrb- at bayern this will alert bayern who will consider hsv 's announcement as a direct challenge to its superiority in the german transfer market and which should prompt much serenading and waving of check books .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge has said the german champions and league leaders want podolski from next season . bayern 's strikers may hinder poldi 's progress bayern 's dominance may actually be a disadvantage in the chase for poldi .
such are the embarrassment of riches at the munich club ; podolski may find himself down the pecking order of strikers behind the likes of roy makaay and claudio pizarro .
in that way , the polish-born striker might consider hamburg a better club as he would be a guaranteed starter up front for hsv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a german hero , poldi could be one of a new breed of hsv stars there may also be more of a challenge at hsv .
while bayern could tempt him with domestic league and cup titles , and possibly a better chance of european glory , hamburg are a team on the up and it could be more attractive prospect to a young and hungry player to be part of bringing the good times back to one of germany 's oldest clubs . striker could favor challenge to bring glory days back success has mostly eluded hamburg since the team 's 1983 european cup win , a 1987 german cup win aside , but hsv is still considered a huge team in germany despite that . however , it has been a while since the club has enjoyed the pulling power necessary to bring the big names to the aol arena .
the signing of dutch star rafael van der vaart in 2005 may have been the catalyst for the club 's current title-challenging form but it could also pave the way for future high profile signings , such as podolski , and a return to the glory days . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podolski 's problem in the bundesliga bundesliga club fc cologne started off strong in the bundesliga with two victories .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier welcomed the appointment and said it is a sign that the united nations recognizes germany 's peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts in afghanistan . koenigs new job wo n't be his first at the un .

" we should all sit down , the government of afghanistan and the international committee and look more closely at these questions . " koenigs will assume his new post in february , at a critical time for afghanistan .
the government is coming into its own , but the country is wracked by instability and experiences frequent attacks from ousted taliban militants .
the opium trade continues to thrive despite international efforts to quell it , and pressure is high to eradicate the opium poppy fields that provide most of western europe with its heroin . germany has played a major role in helping bring stability to afghanistan .
of the roughly 9,000 foreign troops that make up the nato-led international security assistance force , around 2,500 are german . despite the continuing need for peacekeepers , the relatively successful and peaceful parliamentary elections in september have given observers hope that the country could be on its way to stability . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's afghan job still important , still dangerous almost 2,000 german soldiers will move from kabul to northern afghanistan , leaving 500 in the capital , defense minister jung said on thursday .

how much influence will moscow really have ? the world 's most elite club faces a critical test starting sunday as russia takes the helm of the g8 for the first time , determined to prove it belongs despite stark differences with fellow members on basic issues ranging from democracy to iran 's nuclear program . the russian presidency of the group of eight top industrialized nations will also be a milestone for president vladimir putin , whose two terms in the kremlin have focused on restoring russia , humbled by the collapse of the soviet union , to the league of big powers . ' russia can not set the agenda ' but political analysts say his success is under question since moscow 's turn in the g8 driver 's seat has limited symbolic value and no practical benefit for russia . " little of what the g-8 does actually depends on russia , " yury korgunyuk , of the indem policy think tank in moscow , told afp news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in canada dressed up in papier mache heads of g-8 leaders " the presidency works by rotation , so there is nothing special in this .
it 's like saying ' we 'll have the meeting at your house today ' , but the practical agenda is worked out jointly .
russia can not set the g8 agenda by itself . " putin will play host to his fellow g8 leaders at a summit next july in his hometown of saint petersburg , determined to make a more solid transition from being the g8 's " poor relation " to being treated as a full member of the family . from beneficiary to contributor the promotion , analysts say , would involve huge expenditures on global g8 projects in fields like third world poverty reduction , environmental clean-up and weapons reduction programs - projects that moscow is more accustomed to being a beneficiary of rather than a contributor to . still by far the poorest of the world 's " rich " countries , the merits of russia 's membership in the g8 are still seriously questioned by many in the west and moscow admits itself it is not close to joining the club of group of seven finance ministers that controls the group 's purse strings . controversy over stifled ngos russia also faces criticism from other g8 governments over its political course under putin , which critics have characterized as a rollback of democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin has been criticized for stifling dissent on wednesday , a leading international human rights organization , human rights watch , said it wanted to see g8 leaders discuss controversial draft legislation imposing tighter controls on domestic and foreign non-governmental organizations operating in russia . ngos claim he new laws harm democratic development in russia ; the tighter controls could mean silencing one of the last remaining means of government criticism in the country .
putin has since intervened and ordered the bill toned down , but ngos called the move too little , too late . moscow meanwhile remains at odds with washington and three european g8 members over iran 's nuclear program .
while the west fears it is a cover for the islamic state to develop nuclear arms , russia disagrees and is continuing to help iran build its first nuclear power station . ' real influence ' over energy but while differences between russia and the other g8 members abound , they also converge in key areas - chief among them energy supplies , which russia possesses in vast quantities .
putin has said he will place " energy security " at the top of the g8 agenda during russia 's presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil production gives the country its clout " russia could have some real influence in this area , " korgunyuk said .
" it is the only net oil exporter among the g8 countries . " the g8 comprises britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us .
russia 's path to the g8 presidency was long and difficult .
in 1992 , the then-g7 rejected the us proposal to make russia a full member .
for a while the phrase " g7 + 1 " was used to describe the group , when russia was included in discussion of a limited scope of g7 topics . yet even as part of the g8 , russia still is n't fully integrated .
it is not part of the group of seven finance ministers , excluded because of doubts about its economy , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper .
and russia claims to be in no hurry to join the finance ministers group . focus on kyoto despite its uncertain status , russia has big plans for the g8 presidency .
topping the agenda is energy policy . putin has also said he will push for a debt-relief program for the poor states of the ex-soviet union - especially in central asia .
and moscow said it also wants to see decisions made on putting the rules of the kyoto protocol into effect .
russia is a signatory to the kyoto accord , which aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions . " it is important to work with the countries that have yet to sign the treaty , " putin has frequently said .

in the past year , events have forced governments to adapt to an ever-changing threat in the " war on terror . "
germany faces tough decisions in its own fight . the recent scandal surrounding secret prisoner transports by the cia in europe has energized the domestic security debate in germany .
one of the main questions raised is what tactics and strategies should , or should not , be allowed in the global war against terrorism . there is consensus on at least one aspect of the security debate : that the attacks on the world trade center towers in new york on sept .
11 , 2001 , changed the world . " since 9/11 we know we are faced with a terrorism that challenges virtually every facet of the rule of law , " dirk niebel , secretary general of the free-market liberal fdp party , summed up sentiment in germany .
" it is an asymmetric threat that has realigned the division between internal and external security , and the division between intelligence gathering and police work . " the problem is that the enemy operates in the shadows , often blending into the surroundings .
so , to protect its citizens , governments have had to alter their defensive strategies .
this raises a number of legal questions about what intelligence services can and can not do .
what limits are there to collecting information and how should that information be used ?
the debate over these issues is only just beginning . involvement in rendition poses human rights questions much of it has been triggered by revelations in the recent cia affair .
for germany , the scandal mainly revolves around the kidnapping of german citizen khaled el masri in macedonia and his subsequent rendition to afghanistan for interrogation .
europe is aöso investigating the alleged cooperation of states in providing airspace and runways for secret cia flights . it has also emerged that german intelligence agents interrogated terror suspects in the united states ' controversial guantanamo prison as well as in syrian jails that were known for torturing their inmates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri 's case is at the heart of germany 's own cia scandal german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who was responsible for the intelligence services in the previous government , found himself having to clarify the german position in parliament .
" the german government has always made clear that its cooperation with others is based on the rule of law .
and that is especially true in the masri case , " steinmeier said . green party domestic policy expert wolfgang wieland , however , has criticized the government for " overstepping the red line " and making use of what he called the " fruits of torture . " there is nothing in the new german government 's coalition agreement about the status of incarcerated terror suspects .
but the ruling coalition of christian democrats and the social democrats has agreed to expand the federal criminal office 's so-called preventative authority to simplify the pursuit and prosecution of terror suspects . bundeswehr deployment on home soil a hot topic but that 's not enough for interior minister wolfgang schäuble , who wants to use the german armed forces for domestic activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants troops on the streets for events like the world cup " it would be easy to imagine using the army in situations such as the world cup soccer championships , " said schäuble recently .
" if we do n't have enough police , then i think , for example , they could temporarily be used to protect buildings . " schäuble 's proposal has divided the coalition .
the social democrats have called it galling and damaging to the armed forces .
even defense minister franz joseph jung has said the army is not some kind of sheriff 's deputy . it will certainly take a lot of haggling for the coalition to reach a consensus , if it ever does .

up until then , the treatment was only being given to patients whose cancer was at an advanced stage .
ms clark was prepared to use human rights legislation the 49-year-old mother-of-two from bridgwater , somerset , who was willing to sell her home to pay privately for herceptin , is now raising money to help other women with cancer .
she spoke to bbc breakfast 's altered lives series .
i was having a shower one day and washing under my arm when i felt a tiny lump - probably only a quarter of an inch - really tiny , but really hard under the skin .
i went along to my gp and he fast-tracked me to a hospital .
i did n't know it was an aggressive form of cancer at the time but i went to the car and just sobbed .
two weeks later i went for my ' bad news consultation ' and i was told it was the most aggressive form of breast cancer .
it was her2 positive and even with chemotherapy and radio therapy i still only had a 14 % chance of being cancer free in the next year .
it was a terrible shock ...
i just came home and waited to die .
sole carer i told my oldest son first because he was 18 at the time ...
he was very brave but i saw him grow up overnight .
it was a very hard time .
three weeks into chemotherapy , i lost my hair in a couple of days - what a shock .
i think it was worse than having the cancer .
you almost do n't feel like a woman or even a man .
you do n't feel like a human being .
they were actually very kind and they did give it to me on exceptional needs i found the results of the roche trial of herceptin and realised straight away that it was my sort of tumour and it would make a real impact on my disease .
but it all went wrong when i went to the consultant and asked for it .
he said there was absolutely no way i would be getting it through the national health service .
i said : ' i 'm the sole carer of my terminally ill son , please help me ' .
he just said : ' well , what can i do ? '
i said : ' i 'm passionate about staying alive ' and he said : ' well , so is everyone ' .
exceptional need i was aware that there was possibly a case for me to bring a case under the human rights act .
apparently , i have a fundamental right to human life under that act .
so i went to see a human rights solicitor and he said : ' you know , you 're right .
i think you have got a case ' .
i contacted the primary care trust to let them know we were going to undertake legal proceedings .
they held an exceptional needs panel .
i went along .
i spoke to them .
i had 10 minutes to put my case to them ...
i just burst into tears .
there 's just so much emotion and such a short period of time to try and save your life .
but they were actually very kind and they did give it to me on -lrb- the grounds of -rrb- exceptional needs .
odds-on when i won the case for herceptin , and i was the first person in the country to get it , that was great .
it 's not good enough that a whole generation of woman have to die before this drug is administered but then i thought : ' what about all those other woman that do n't perhaps have a house to sell or do n't have exceptional need ? '
it 's not good enough that a whole generation of woman have to die before this drug is administered and so i started fighting for them too .
it gives me an odds-on chance of survival and 66 % sounds a lot better than 14 % .
i approach the new year with real hope but yes , i know it could come back .
but i am not going to give up and i hope if it does come back that i approach it with the same courage that i approached the cancer the first time around .

they were actually very kind and they did give it to me on exceptional needs i found the results of the roche trial of herceptin and realised straight away that it was my sort of tumour and it would make a real impact on my disease .
but it all went wrong when i went to the consultant and asked for it .
he said there was absolutely no way i would be getting it through the national health service .
i said : ' i 'm the sole carer of my terminally ill son , please help me ' .
he just said : ' well , what can i do ? '
i said : ' i 'm passionate about staying alive ' and he said : ' well , so is everyone ' .
exceptional need i was aware that there was possibly a case for me to bring a case under the human rights act .
apparently , i have a fundamental right to human life under that act .
so i went to see a human rights solicitor and he said : ' you know , you 're right .
i think you have got a case ' .
i contacted the primary care trust to let them know we were going to undertake legal proceedings .
they held an exceptional needs panel .
i went along .
i spoke to them .
i had 10 minutes to put my case to them ...
i just burst into tears .
there 's just so much emotion and such a short period of time to try and save your life .
but they were actually very kind and they did give it to me on -lrb- the grounds of -rrb- exceptional needs .
odds-on when i won the case for herceptin , and i was the first person in the country to get it , that was great .
it 's not good enough that a whole generation of woman have to die before this drug is administered but then i thought : ' what about all those other woman that do n't perhaps have a house to sell or do n't have exceptional need ? '
it 's not good enough that a whole generation of woman have to die before this drug is administered and so i started fighting for them too .
it gives me an odds-on chance of survival and 66 % sounds a lot better than 14 % .
i approach the new year with real hope but yes , i know it could come back .
but i am not going to give up and i hope if it does come back that i approach it with the same courage that i approached the cancer the first time around .

up until then , the treatment was only being given to patients whose cancer was at an advanced stage .
ms clark was prepared to use human rights legislation the 49-year-old mother-of-two from bridgwater , somerset , who was willing to sell her home to pay privately for herceptin , is now raising money to help other women with cancer .
she spoke to bbc breakfast 's altered lives series .
i was having a shower one day and washing under my arm when i felt a tiny lump - probably only a quarter of an inch - really tiny , but really hard under the skin .
i went along to my gp and he fast-tracked me to a hospital .
i did n't know it was an aggressive form of cancer at the time but i went to the car and just sobbed .
two weeks later i went for my ' bad news consultation ' and i was told it was the most aggressive form of breast cancer .
it was her2 positive and even with chemotherapy and radio therapy i still only had a 14 % chance of being cancer free in the next year .
it was a terrible shock ...
i just came home and waited to die .
sole carer i told my oldest son first because he was 18 at the time ...
he was very brave but i saw him grow up overnight .
it was a very hard time .
three weeks into chemotherapy , i lost my hair in a couple of days - what a shock .
i think it was worse than having the cancer .
you almost do n't feel like a woman or even a man .
you do n't feel like a human being .
they were actually very kind and they did give it to me on exceptional needs i found the results of the roche trial of herceptin and realised straight away that it was my sort of tumour and it would make a real impact on my disease .
but it all went wrong when i went to the consultant and asked for it .
he said there was absolutely no way i would be getting it through the national health service .
i said : ' i 'm the sole carer of my terminally ill son , please help me ' .
he just said : ' well , what can i do ? '
i said : ' i 'm passionate about staying alive ' and he said : ' well , so is everyone ' .
exceptional need i was aware that there was possibly a case for me to bring a case under the human rights act .
apparently , i have a fundamental right to human life under that act .
so i went to see a human rights solicitor and he said : ' you know , you 're right .
i think you have got a case ' .
i contacted the primary care trust to let them know we were going to undertake legal proceedings .
they held an exceptional needs panel .
i went along .
i spoke to them .
i had 10 minutes to put my case to them ...
i just burst into tears .
there 's just so much emotion and such a short period of time to try and save your life .
but they were actually very kind and they did give it to me on -lrb- the grounds of -rrb- exceptional needs .
odds-on when i won the case for herceptin , and i was the first person in the country to get it , that was great .
it 's not good enough that a whole generation of woman have to die before this drug is administered but then i thought : ' what about all those other woman that do n't perhaps have a house to sell or do n't have exceptional need ? '

world of warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game and , as that lengthy title implies , gives gamers the chance to control characters in a large net-based fantasy world .
characters can be one of several different races , that includes humans , orcs and cow-like creature called tauren , and can take up a profession as warrior , thief , wizard , priest and so on .
but for some warcraft players slaying monsters and gathering treasure is not enough .
instead of swords they are using economics as a weapon .
this is because for all its fantasy trappings , one aspect of warcraft is alarmingly similar to the real world and that is the importance of money .
money talks game cash in the form of copper , silver and gold coins helps characters buy better weapons and armour so they can stay alive longer and climb the ranks of their chosen profession .
powerful characters need cash to buy their mount and it is in the making of money that many players are starting to exploit the freedom of the game world .
most warcraft players ' efforts to build up a bankroll for their character revolve around the in-game auction houses .
in these virtual sale-rooms players earn cash by selling the loot that drops off monsters when they are killed .
others players auction off the raw materials they find in the game world so others can use them to make magic potions , magical items or other useful items .
but use of the auction house does not begin and end with bidding , buying and selling - many are turning use of it into as much of a game as adventuring in azeroth .
evidence for this can be found in the fact that at the recent blizzcon conference , the biggest cheer about the forthcoming wow expansion went to the news that it will give every city an auction house .
cash crop some warcraft players have turned into so-called " farmers " but this does not mean that they have turned their swords into ploughshares .
instead " farming " is jargon for those that stay in one area of the game world and repeatedly kill particular monsters just to get at the coveted loot , be it arms or armour , that they drop .
in warcraft many farmers repeatedly go through the game 's " instances " - stand alone dungeons - because the monsters in them are guaranteed to drop rare items .
stocked up with this loot , the farmers travel to an auction house and flog their gear for gold .
paul younger , co-editor of the worldofwar.net site , said many of these pro-players live in asia and the game currency they get hold of is sold for real cash .
more money means better equipment for your characters at the time of writing , 1000 gold pieces of warcraft money sold for about £ 50 .
since online games started to appear currency , items and characters for them have been sold via ebay and specialist sites that do nothing but trade in game gear .
edward castronova , a professor at indiana university who studies the economics of game gear sales , believes that annually gamers are spending at least $ 200m -lrb- £ 115m -rrb- to buy currencies , accounts and characters .
many use specially written programs to control the in-game characters and only intervene to fend off other players or suspicious community managers from warcraft controller blizzard .
others abuse loopholes in game code to make items or rack up huge amounts of virtual cash .
mr younger said " gold-farming " was risky as it could get players banned from the game .
but he admits that bans will not stop the farmers because the companies behind them make so much cash by re-selling game gold .
" although blizzard bans players caught farming by removing their account it would be practically impossible to prosecute the companies carrying out these operations , " he said .
playing players some look to maximise their returns by controlling the price of a particular item .
every time this item turns up on the auction house , the player buys it , then puts it up for auction again at a higher price to the keep the profits rolling in .
you even need cash to fly to new places in warcraft some have taken this to ridiculous lengths .
in april 2005 two players on the elune server bought all the tradable items on sale in the ironforge auction house .
they then promptly put everything back up for sale at a significant mark up .
but one player who has turned playing the auction house into almost an art is alex tabony .
he uses a warcraft add-on program called auctioneer to fine tune his exploitation of the auction house .
he describes his method as " pure bot reverse engineering " .
via auctioneer , mr tabony can find the highest price that items have sold for in earlier auctions .
many people use this function of the auctioneer software to track down bargains .
" my method is to artificially manipulate the high selling point of any item , " he told the bbc news website .
" if you can control the market price of a specific item type for a while you can ' set ' the high selling point for other user 's auctioneer data . "
once users get used to seeing items listed for very high prices , mr tabony then puts up lots of that item priced way below the high point .
players snap these up because they look cheap though in fact they may be paying much more than they need to .
it is a method that works with any tradable item , said mr tabony , not just coveted and powerful magic items .
by careful use of this price-setting system it is possible to get hundreds , or perhaps , thousands of gold pieces quite quickly .
" the limit is realistically how much time one wants to invest into it , " he said .

world of warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game and , as that lengthy title implies , gives gamers the chance to control characters in a large net-based fantasy world .
characters can be one of several different races , that includes humans , orcs and cow-like creature called tauren , and can take up a profession as warrior , thief , wizard , priest and so on .
but for some warcraft players slaying monsters and gathering treasure is not enough .
instead of swords they are using economics as a weapon .
this is because for all its fantasy trappings , one aspect of warcraft is alarmingly similar to the real world and that is the importance of money .
money talks game cash in the form of copper , silver and gold coins helps characters buy better weapons and armour so they can stay alive longer and climb the ranks of their chosen profession .
powerful characters need cash to buy their mount and it is in the making of money that many players are starting to exploit the freedom of the game world .
most warcraft players ' efforts to build up a bankroll for their character revolve around the in-game auction houses .
in these virtual sale-rooms players earn cash by selling the loot that drops off monsters when they are killed .
others players auction off the raw materials they find in the game world so others can use them to make magic potions , magical items or other useful items .
but use of the auction house does not begin and end with bidding , buying and selling - many are turning use of it into as much of a game as adventuring in azeroth .
evidence for this can be found in the fact that at the recent blizzcon conference , the biggest cheer about the forthcoming wow expansion went to the news that it will give every city an auction house .
cash crop some warcraft players have turned into so-called " farmers " but this does not mean that they have turned their swords into ploughshares .
instead " farming " is jargon for those that stay in one area of the game world and repeatedly kill particular monsters just to get at the coveted loot , be it arms or armour , that they drop .
in warcraft many farmers repeatedly go through the game 's " instances " - stand alone dungeons - because the monsters in them are guaranteed to drop rare items .
stocked up with this loot , the farmers travel to an auction house and flog their gear for gold .
paul younger , co-editor of the worldofwar.net site , said many of these pro-players live in asia and the game currency they get hold of is sold for real cash .
more money means better equipment for your characters at the time of writing , 1000 gold pieces of warcraft money sold for about £ 50 .
since online games started to appear currency , items and characters for them have been sold via ebay and specialist sites that do nothing but trade in game gear .
edward castronova , a professor at indiana university who studies the economics of game gear sales , believes that annually gamers are spending at least $ 200m -lrb- £ 115m -rrb- to buy currencies , accounts and characters .
many use specially written programs to control the in-game characters and only intervene to fend off other players or suspicious community managers from warcraft controller blizzard .
others abuse loopholes in game code to make items or rack up huge amounts of virtual cash .
mr younger said " gold-farming " was risky as it could get players banned from the game .
but he admits that bans will not stop the farmers because the companies behind them make so much cash by re-selling game gold .
" although blizzard bans players caught farming by removing their account it would be practically impossible to prosecute the companies carrying out these operations , " he said .
playing players some look to maximise their returns by controlling the price of a particular item .
every time this item turns up on the auction house , the player buys it , then puts it up for auction again at a higher price to the keep the profits rolling in .
you even need cash to fly to new places in warcraft some have taken this to ridiculous lengths .
in april 2005 two players on the elune server bought all the tradable items on sale in the ironforge auction house .
they then promptly put everything back up for sale at a significant mark up .
but one player who has turned playing the auction house into almost an art is alex tabony .
he uses a warcraft add-on program called auctioneer to fine tune his exploitation of the auction house .
he describes his method as " pure bot reverse engineering " .
via auctioneer , mr tabony can find the highest price that items have sold for in earlier auctions .
many people use this function of the auctioneer software to track down bargains .
" my method is to artificially manipulate the high selling point of any item , " he told the bbc news website .
" if you can control the market price of a specific item type for a while you can ' set ' the high selling point for other user 's auctioneer data . "
once users get used to seeing items listed for very high prices , mr tabony then puts up lots of that item priced way below the high point .
players snap these up because they look cheap though in fact they may be paying much more than they need to .
it is a method that works with any tradable item , said mr tabony , not just coveted and powerful magic items .
by careful use of this price-setting system it is possible to get hundreds , or perhaps , thousands of gold pieces quite quickly .
" the limit is realistically how much time one wants to invest into it , " he said .

he uses a warcraft add-on program called auctioneer to fine tune his exploitation of the auction house .
he describes his method as " pure bot reverse engineering " .
via auctioneer , mr tabony can find the highest price that items have sold for in earlier auctions .
many people use this function of the auctioneer software to track down bargains .
" my method is to artificially manipulate the high selling point of any item , " he told the bbc news website .
" if you can control the market price of a specific item type for a while you can ' set ' the high selling point for other user 's auctioneer data . "
once users get used to seeing items listed for very high prices , mr tabony then puts up lots of that item priced way below the high point .
players snap these up because they look cheap though in fact they may be paying much more than they need to .
it is a method that works with any tradable item , said mr tabony , not just coveted and powerful magic items .
by careful use of this price-setting system it is possible to get hundreds , or perhaps , thousands of gold pieces quite quickly .
" the limit is realistically how much time one wants to invest into it , " he said .

world of warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game and , as that lengthy title implies , gives gamers the chance to control characters in a large net-based fantasy world .
characters can be one of several different races , that includes humans , orcs and cow-like creature called tauren , and can take up a profession as warrior , thief , wizard , priest and so on .
but for some warcraft players slaying monsters and gathering treasure is not enough .
instead of swords they are using economics as a weapon .
this is because for all its fantasy trappings , one aspect of warcraft is alarmingly similar to the real world and that is the importance of money .
money talks game cash in the form of copper , silver and gold coins helps characters buy better weapons and armour so they can stay alive longer and climb the ranks of their chosen profession .
powerful characters need cash to buy their mount and it is in the making of money that many players are starting to exploit the freedom of the game world .
most warcraft players ' efforts to build up a bankroll for their character revolve around the in-game auction houses .
in these virtual sale-rooms players earn cash by selling the loot that drops off monsters when they are killed .
others players auction off the raw materials they find in the game world so others can use them to make magic potions , magical items or other useful items .
but use of the auction house does not begin and end with bidding , buying and selling - many are turning use of it into as much of a game as adventuring in azeroth .
evidence for this can be found in the fact that at the recent blizzcon conference , the biggest cheer about the forthcoming wow expansion went to the news that it will give every city an auction house .
cash crop some warcraft players have turned into so-called " farmers " but this does not mean that they have turned their swords into ploughshares .
instead " farming " is jargon for those that stay in one area of the game world and repeatedly kill particular monsters just to get at the coveted loot , be it arms or armour , that they drop .
in warcraft many farmers repeatedly go through the game 's " instances " - stand alone dungeons - because the monsters in them are guaranteed to drop rare items .
stocked up with this loot , the farmers travel to an auction house and flog their gear for gold .
paul younger , co-editor of the worldofwar.net site , said many of these pro-players live in asia and the game currency they get hold of is sold for real cash .
more money means better equipment for your characters at the time of writing , 1000 gold pieces of warcraft money sold for about £ 50 .
since online games started to appear currency , items and characters for them have been sold via ebay and specialist sites that do nothing but trade in game gear .
edward castronova , a professor at indiana university who studies the economics of game gear sales , believes that annually gamers are spending at least $ 200m -lrb- £ 115m -rrb- to buy currencies , accounts and characters .
many use specially written programs to control the in-game characters and only intervene to fend off other players or suspicious community managers from warcraft controller blizzard .
others abuse loopholes in game code to make items or rack up huge amounts of virtual cash .
mr younger said " gold-farming " was risky as it could get players banned from the game .
but he admits that bans will not stop the farmers because the companies behind them make so much cash by re-selling game gold .
" although blizzard bans players caught farming by removing their account it would be practically impossible to prosecute the companies carrying out these operations , " he said .
playing players some look to maximise their returns by controlling the price of a particular item .
every time this item turns up on the auction house , the player buys it , then puts it up for auction again at a higher price to the keep the profits rolling in .
you even need cash to fly to new places in warcraft some have taken this to ridiculous lengths .
in april 2005 two players on the elune server bought all the tradable items on sale in the ironforge auction house .
they then promptly put everything back up for sale at a significant mark up .

mr younger said " gold-farming " was risky as it could get players banned from the game .
but he admits that bans will not stop the farmers because the companies behind them make so much cash by re-selling game gold .
" although blizzard bans players caught farming by removing their account it would be practically impossible to prosecute the companies carrying out these operations , " he said .
playing players some look to maximise their returns by controlling the price of a particular item .
every time this item turns up on the auction house , the player buys it , then puts it up for auction again at a higher price to the keep the profits rolling in .
some have taken this to ridiculous lengths .
in april 2005 two players on the elune server bought all the tradable items on sale in the ironforge auction house .
they then promptly put everything back up for sale at a significant mark up .
but one player who has turned playing the auction house into almost an art is alex tabony .
he uses a warcraft add-on program called auctioneer to fine tune his exploitation of the auction house .
he describes his method as " pure bot reverse engineering " .
via auctioneer , mr tabony can find the highest price that items have sold for in earlier auctions .
many people use this function of the auctioneer software to track down bargains .
" my method is to artificially manipulate the high selling point of any item , " he told the bbc news website .
" if you can control the market price of a specific item type for a while you can ' set ' the high selling point for other user 's auctioneer data . "
once users get used to seeing items listed for very high prices , mr tabony then puts up lots of that item priced way below the high point .
players snap these up because they look cheap though in fact they may be paying much more than they need to .
it is a method that works with any tradable item , said mr tabony , not just coveted and powerful magic items .
by careful use of this price-setting system it is possible to get hundreds , or perhaps , thousands of gold pieces quite quickly .
" the limit is realistically how much time one wants to invest into it , " he said .

world of warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game and , as that lengthy title implies , gives gamers the chance to control characters in a large net-based fantasy world .
characters can be one of several different races , that includes humans , orcs and cow-like creature called tauren , and can take up a profession as warrior , thief , wizard , priest and so on .
but for some warcraft players slaying monsters and gathering treasure is not enough .
instead of swords they are using economics as a weapon .
this is because for all its fantasy trappings , one aspect of warcraft is alarmingly similar to the real world and that is the importance of money .
money talks game cash in the form of copper , silver and gold coins helps characters buy better weapons and armour so they can stay alive longer and climb the ranks of their chosen profession .
and it is in the making of money that many players are starting to exploit the freedom of the game world .
most warcraft players ' efforts to build up a bankroll for their character revolve around the in-game auction houses .
in these virtual sale-rooms players earn cash by selling the loot that drops off monsters when they are killed .
others players auction off the raw materials they find in the game world so others can use them to make magic potions , magical items or other useful items .
but use of the auction house does not begin and end with bidding , buying and selling - many are turning use of it into as much of a game as adventuring in azeroth .
evidence for this can be found in the fact that at the recent blizzcon conference , the biggest cheer about the forthcoming wow expansion went to the news that it will give every city an auction house .
cash crop some warcraft players have turned into so-called " farmers " but this does not mean that they have turned their swords into ploughshares .
instead " farming " is jargon for those that stay in one area of the game world and repeatedly kill particular monsters just to get at the coveted loot , be it arms or armour , that they drop .
in warcraft many farmers repeatedly go through the game 's " instances " - stand alone dungeons - because the monsters in them are guaranteed to drop rare items .
stocked up with this loot , the farmers travel to an auction house and flog their gear for gold .
paul younger , co-editor of the worldofwar.net site , said many of these pro-players live in asia and the game currency they get hold of is sold for real cash .
at the time of writing , 1000 gold pieces of warcraft money sold for about £ 50 .
since online games started to appear currency , items and characters for them have been sold via ebay and specialist sites that do nothing but trade in game gear .
edward castronova , a professor at indiana university who studies the economics of game gear sales , believes that annually gamers are spending at least $ 200m -lrb- £ 115m -rrb- to buy currencies , accounts and characters .
many use specially written programs to control the in-game characters and only intervene to fend off other players or suspicious community managers from warcraft controller blizzard .
others abuse loopholes in game code to make items or rack up huge amounts of virtual cash .
mr younger said " gold-farming " was risky as it could get players banned from the game .

china plans to bring in a market-making trading system for the yuan early in 2006 , letting it float more freely against foreign currencies .
according to reports , the 13 banks include foreign lenders citigroup , hsbc , abn amro and standard chartered .
the market-makers could begin their roles as early as next week .
critics have complained that the government 's tight control of the yuan has kept it undervalued , making chinese exports artificially cheap and damaging other countries ' trade balances .
government intervention china changed its exchange rate policy last summer , revaluing the yuan 2.1 % higher and getting rid of its tie to the dollar .
it is now allowed to rise or fall by 0.3 % a day against a basket of other currencies , including the japanese yen and the uk pound .
but close supervision by the government has meant that the yuan has risen by just 0.48 % since the revaluation .
the chinese government says that introducing market-makers , who must trade the yuan at quoted sell and buy prices , will limit the extent to which it can intervene in the currency markets .
meanwhile , chinese press reports say a consortium led by citigroup has made a successful bid of 24.1bn yuan -lrb- $ 3bn ; £ 1.7bn -rrb- for a controlling stake in guangdong development bank .
the deal is for 85 % of the state-owned bank , with citibank keeping a 50 % stake and the remaining shares split among several chinese partners .
it would make citigroup the first overseas company to buy a controlling stake in a state-run chinese bank .
such a deal would need to be approved by the government , which has set a 20 % limit on foreign investment in chinese banks .
china is obliged to open its banking sector to foreign competition under the terms of its admission to the world trade organization .

a tube strike is still threatening to disrupt the entire network on new year 's eve , after talks broke down .
thousands of london underground -lrb- lu -rrb- workers are due to walk out for 24 hours at noon on saturday .
on thursday the rmt union refused to attend talks , after lu turned down its request to delay the introduction of new rotas at the centre of the dispute .
london 's mayor said the strike would " spoil a great night out for hundreds of thousands of londoners " .
crowds fill the streets around trafalgar , parliament and leicester squares and the victoria embankment to hear big ben strike and watch the fireworks display at midnight .
the mayor had planned to offer free travel on the tube from 2345 gmt on new year 's eve to 0430 gmt the following day .
but now all tube lines face disruption , because of the row over the implications of shifting lu staff onto a 35-hour week .
we had no choice bobby law , rmt travel advice the rail , maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- union says when it agreed to make the change , it had not been shown new work patterns .
it says it understood 200 staff would be moved to new jobs , but claims there are plans to move up to 800 people - which it says will leave some stations short of staff and compromise safety .
the union had offered to suspend the action , if lu agreed to suspend the introduction of the rotas , to allow more time for talks .
but tube bosses turned down the " ultimatum " , saying it could have compromised holiday arrangements for thousands of staff .
of the strike , rmt regional organiser bobby law told the bbc : " we had no choice really .
striking on new year 's eve is not about industrial relations .
it is a cynical way to exploit londoners mike brown , lu " it 's lu that wo n't suspend the introduction of the rosters which we believe is unsafe - not just for our members - should they be introduced .
we believe they will be unsafe for the travelling public as well . "
lu 's chief operating officer , mike brown said the union had not raised any specific safety concerns with them .
" does anyone really expect that , after what we have seen this year where the underground staff behaved magnificently in the response to 7 july , that we would ever want to operate a system that was less safe ? " he said .
he said lu would remain available " for the next 24 hours , right up to the 11th hour before this strike " for talks .
" striking on new year 's eve is not about industrial relations , " he said .
" it is a cynical way to exploit londoners and i think it is a big mistake . "

brokeback mountain is leading the golden globe nominations nominations for the golden globe awards gave the first indication of which movies are likely to fare well in hollywood 's annual horse race .
brokeback mountain , the constant gardener and good night , and good luck are among the favourites .
at this stage in the game , most actors tend to feign indifference towards the oscars campaign as it rolls out during the winter months .
" it 's a real strange concept to me that films and actors can compete against each other , " says heath ledger , a front-runner for his role as a gay cowboy in brokeback mountain .
" we 're not running the same race , we 're not doing the same sports and we 're all training differently .
you ca n't really compare them , " says the 26-year-old actor from australia .
" it really is manufactured for marketing reasons , but we ca n't help but get dragged into it .
" other peoples ' opinions drag us as actors and filmmakers into this false sense of first , success , if they nominate you and then , secondly , a false sense of failure when you do n't win . "
you have to enjoy your moment - because it 's only a moment and then it 's gone .
and that 's fine . "
keira knightly ledger may have more reason than most to be playing it cool .
gay-themed films rarely do well in the best film category at the oscars .
the seemingly more liberal-minded voters of the foreign press association , responsible for the globes , tend to embrace films like brokeback mountain , more readily than their counterparts at the academy of motion picture arts and sciences .
when they are announced on 31 january , the nominations for the 78th academy awards are likely to feature the names of several british performers .
dame judi dench is no stranger to the oscars once again , the best actress category could be the most hotly contested .
dame judi dench is tipped to receive her fifth oscar nomination for her performance in mrs henderson presents .
" our job really is not to listen to speculation about that kind of thing but to say : ' have we told this story properly ? '
if we 've told it properly i 'll be really pleased , " says dame judi .
keira knightly could prove to be hot competition for her performance as elizabeth bennet in pride and prejudice .

the channel axed its five-day-a-week soap in august in order to invest its £ 10m budget in new primetime drama and comedy .
but had the soap 's " natural lifespan " come to an end , as five 's director of programmes dan chambers stated ?
family affairs was the first show broadcast on five when it launched in march 1997 , based around the middle class hart family living somewhere in maidenhead .
loyal viewers a ratings-chasing revamp saw most of that family perish in a boat accident before charnham was relocated to west london .
soon the villainy of pub landlord pete callan -lrb- played by david easter -rrb- , the relationship trauma of yasmin green -lrb- ebony thomas -rrb- and the gossip of sadie hargreaves lloyd -lrb- barbara young -rrb- took centre stage .
compared to rival soaps the show 's ratings remained low but consistent , attracting about one million viewers per episode .
long-term characters such as villain pete callan helped retain viewers " out of all the soaps , viewers remained incredibly loyal to family affairs , " says dominic treadwell-collins , who worked as story producer on the show .
" they related to the characters and cared a great deal about them . "
young , who played sadie for nearly seven years , agrees .
" i still get stopped in the street and lifted off my feet by very large ladies , " she says .
" i suppose they saw sadie as this lovable auntie figure .
she was nosey , but nice with it . "
the pace of production at family affairs - which shared its studio in merton , south london , with police drama the bill - was frenetic .
" i was filming in sheffield when i found out i had the part , " says young .

ex-family affairs producer johann knobel says writers used the show 's format of five weekly episodes to create longer " slow-burning " storylines .
" as the show was ' under the radar ' in many respects , we did not feel we were driven by ratings , " mr knobel says .
" this enabled us to take more risks with stories , developing plots with more depth and interest . "
he cites a storyline in which karen webb , played by tanya franks , fell in love with the surrogate mother of her baby .
" we told that story in a mature way , looking at issues of sexuality without making them sensational , " he says .
extra competition mr knobel says he was adamant that family affairs characters would never be changed merely to serve a twist in the plot .
" this gave characters an integrity that viewers could believe in , " he says .
a family affairs storyline , in which a couple learned that a family friend had abused their daughter , earned the show two british soap awards in may .
but since 1997 , rival soaps eastenders , coronation street and emmerdale added extra weekly episodes and all terrestrial tv shows faced increased multi-channel competition .
karen webb -lrb- left -rrb- fell in love with the surrogate mother of her baby the cancellation of the revived crossroads , itv 's night and day and channel 4 's long-running brookside in 2003 confirmed that soap opera longevity was no longer assured .
" with the awards under our belt we thought family affairs would be extended for longer than the usual year , " says mr treadwell-collins .
" instead it was axed . "
now a series story editor on eastenders , he is convinced the soap would have thrived on another channel .
" there is a stigma attached to five - some viewers still think it just shows boobs and keith chegwin , " he says .
" we also wanted the channel to publicise family affairs more . "
now a producer on holby city , mr knobel said five 's investment in the soap was " a huge amount of money " for the channel .
" it was purely an economic decision to cancel it . "
the final episode will see the entire cast assemble on stanley street for a final time , with a few potential surprises .
" we did not tie everything up , so some characters can have a life outside charnham , " says mr treadwell-collins .
" family affairs was a warm show so we wanted to give it a positive send-off . "
