a water-dropping aircraft from italy was due to join the efforts later against wildfires which circled coimbra , portugal 's third-largest city , and continued to threaten some built-up areas .
but three helicopters from germany , along with 25 anti-fire specialists , would likely not be deployed until tuesday because they will arrive too close to sundown , the agency said .
two fire-fighting helicopters sent from the netherlands were also due to arrive tuesday , dutch officials said . in total over 2,600 firefighters backed by 31 water-dropping aircraft and nearly 800 vehicles were involved in the firefighting operation in portugal , which is facing its worst drought since 1945 . bildunterschrift : european solidarity the president of the european commission , jose barroso , who on sunday visited areas affected by fires in his native portugal where he is on holiday , praised the aid offered by eu nations to portugal .
" we are all very impressed by the size of this problem .
but it is with satisfaction that we watch european solidarity once more at work , " he told reporters in northern portugal , in comments broadcast on lisbon-based tsf radio .
portugal appealed for help from its fellow european union member states on saturday after the number of blazes raging out of control in the country rose above 50 , the highest single day tally so far this year .
the fast-moving wildfires had already charred at least 12 homes on the outskirts of coimbra , located some 200 kilometers of lisbon , and forced the evacuation overnight of some 60 people , local officials said .
with a change in wind direction , coimbra itself was no longer threatened by the flames , but firefighters were on guard against the possibility of flare-ups in the charred areas near the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was a terrible night for the people of the city and for everyone involved in fighting the fire , " the governor of the district of coimbra , henrique fernandes , told state television rtp .
forecasters meanwhile predicted temperatures would soar above a scorching 35 degrees celsius -lrb- 95 fahrenheit -rrb- in some areas , raising the risk of new fires , and remain high until at least wednesday .
emergency workers were evacuating residents from a village near coimbra because of the the threat from the thick smoke and advancing flames , tsf reported . police said at least five roads in the center and north of the country were closed because of the flames and smoke . calls for joint fire-fighting force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on french radio , interior minister antonio costa said meanwhile that europe should combine its resources in fighting fires , notably by jointly building specialized water-bombing aircraft .
" it is essential to pool our resources because we have fires in portugal , but tomorrow there could be others in spain , in italy , in greece , " costa told french radio station europe 1 .
his comments echoed those of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who on sunday also called for the eu to set up a joint firefighting force .
ten firefighters have died so far this year battling blazes in portugal which have already destroyed 134,500 hectares -lrb- 332,000 acres -rrb- of land - more than in all of 2004 when just under 130,000 hectares burned . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heat wave fears rise as portugal burns as forest fires continue to rage throughout portugal , a deadly heat wave spreading across southern europe is causing concern in spain and france .

the employees will be allowed to continue working in a joint venture with an external partner , the paper said . the chief of opel 's workers ' union , klaus franz , said that the plan was contrary to the contract agreed on in march , but gm disagreed .

without missing a beat , she began dancing to turkish music with local residents and party supporters .
crowding around them and adding to the mayhem , a ring of journalists from many of germany 's major media outlets scrambled to capture the action . roth then led the throngs into a turkish diner shop , where she shaved meat from the giant spit while cameras hummed and whirred .
it was a textbook media opportunity . " the opposition likes to campaign at the cost of minorities , " roth told her cheering supporters .
" that really kills the mood in this country . " a serious reason behind the fun the greens have been going out of their way to make a scene in berlin this august to convey a simple message : we are a party that can have fun , and we are a party that still matters for the parliamentary election next month . in the past weeks , interested citizens have been invited by the party 's leadership to explore berlin 's neighborhoods on foot , on skates , and on the water - in a solar-powered boat , of course .
on these outings , participants receive an education in the green way of life and are meant to experience first hand the " chillness " of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer 's not just " peddling " green ideas the interested could play blitz chess with party co-chair reinhard bütikofer , tour the city 's bars with the green youth or discuss the country 's new prostitution law in a berlin brothel . despite the " fun factor " involved in the events , the party has a serious reason for offering them .
given the current party constellations and the rise of the newly founded left party , the greens need to do everything they can to make themselves apparent , said wolfgang donsbach , a political communications professor at dresden 's technical university . somewhat off-beat campaign events , such as the kreuzberg tour , could help the party if they reach a nationwide audience , he added .
with a new edition of the current governing coalition with the social democrats unlikely and having been overshadowed by the upstart left party as the " hot new thing , " greens must raise their profile somehow or they will run the risk of irrelevancy . repeating previous mistakes ? it 's an approach that 's been -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- tried before .
the green party 's idiosyncratic line-up of publicity events has been turning heads in berlin and perhaps effecting an image change .
but the campaign planners will have to be careful that too much mirth can damage the perception of the greens as a party fit to govern germany . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung recently referred to the " fun campaign of the eco-party , " drawing a parallel to similar attempts by the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- to woo voters during the 2002 election . the fdp garnered the moniker of " fun party " mostly through the antics of party chief guido westerwelle , who was hoping to create a new image with the ambitious goal of reaching 18 percent of the vote .
but westerwelle 's shenanigans failed to grab media attention and linked the fdp with levity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun times did n't last long for the free democrats the result at the polls was certainly not a laughing matter .
despite the " guidomobile " , the flashy yellow motor home westerwelle used to tour germany under the motto " politics can also be fun " ; despite the ' 18 % ' garishly inscribed on his shoe soles ; despite his appearance on the voyeuristic tv show big brother ; or rather , as many say , because of these silly actions , the fdp reached a disappointing 7.4 percent of the vote , putting a jarring end to the party 's summer of fun . optimism backed by plans this summer , the mood for the premature bundestag election campaign is visibly more solemn .
when german voters go to the polls on sept .
18 , the " fun factor " probably is n't high on their lists : the malaise surrounding record unemployment and sluggish growth preclude any campaign strategies with non-serious content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jürgen trittin checks out a hippopotamus at berlin 's zoo karl rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisberg-essen in western germany , said that the times are too dire for a " fun party . " but the greens do n't seem to follow in the fdp 's footsteps , korte added . " they do n't want to be the fun party , but perhaps lighten their image somewhat , " korte said .
" they want to avoid the stigma that ' if it 's green , then it must taste bad . '
they want to develop a profile of wellness . " exuding an optimistic , positive attitude is crucial for the success of a party , donsbach said . the perception of a " good mood " is essential , " but it has to be supported by good policies , " he said .
" only with fun , only with ballyhoo , it wo n't work .

it was a textbook media opportunity . " the opposition likes to campaign at the cost of minorities , " roth told her cheering supporters .
" that really kills the mood in this country . " a serious reason behind the fun the greens have been going out of their way to make a scene in berlin this august to convey a simple message : we are a party that can have fun , and we are a party that still matters for the parliamentary election next month . in the past weeks , interested citizens have been invited by the party 's leadership to explore berlin 's neighborhoods on foot , on skates , and on the water - in a solar-powered boat , of course .
on these outings , participants receive an education in the green way of life and are meant to experience first hand the " chillness " of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer 's not just " peddling " green ideas the interested could play blitz chess with party co-chair reinhard bütikofer , tour the city 's bars with the green youth or discuss the country 's new prostitution law in a berlin brothel . despite the " fun factor " involved in the events , the party has a serious reason for offering them .
given the current party constellations and the rise of the newly founded left party , the greens need to do everything they can to make themselves apparent , said wolfgang donsbach , a political communications professor at dresden 's technical university . somewhat off-beat campaign events , such as the kreuzberg tour , could help the party if they reach a nationwide audience , he added .
with a new edition of the current governing coalition with the social democrats unlikely and having been overshadowed by the upstart left party as the " hot new thing , " greens must raise their profile somehow or they will run the risk of irrelevancy . repeating previous mistakes ? it 's an approach that 's been -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- tried before .
the green party 's idiosyncratic line-up of publicity events has been turning heads in berlin and perhaps effecting an image change .
but the campaign planners will have to be careful that too much mirth can damage the perception of the greens as a party fit to govern germany . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung recently referred to the " fun campaign of the eco-party , " drawing a parallel to similar attempts by the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- to woo voters during the 2002 election . the fdp garnered the moniker of " fun party " mostly through the antics of party chief guido westerwelle , who was hoping to create a new image with the ambitious goal of reaching 18 percent of the vote .
but westerwelle 's shenanigans failed to grab media attention and linked the fdp with levity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun times did n't last long for the free democrats the result at the polls was certainly not a laughing matter .
despite the " guidomobile " , the flashy yellow motor home westerwelle used to tour germany under the motto " politics can also be fun " ; despite the ' 18 % ' garishly inscribed on his shoe soles ; despite his appearance on the voyeuristic tv show big brother ; or rather , as many say , because of these silly actions , the fdp reached a disappointing 7.4 percent of the vote , putting a jarring end to the party 's summer of fun . optimism backed by plans this summer , the mood for the premature bundestag election campaign is visibly more solemn .
when german voters go to the polls on sept .
18 , the " fun factor " probably is n't high on their lists : the malaise surrounding record unemployment and sluggish growth preclude any campaign strategies with non-serious content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jürgen trittin checks out a hippopotamus at berlin 's zoo karl rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisberg-essen in western germany , said that the times are too dire for a " fun party . " but the greens do n't seem to follow in the fdp 's footsteps , korte added . " they do n't want to be the fun party , but perhaps lighten their image somewhat , " korte said .
" they want to avoid the stigma that ' if it 's green , then it must taste bad . '
they want to develop a profile of wellness . " exuding an optimistic , positive attitude is crucial for the success of a party , donsbach said . the perception of a " good mood " is essential , " but it has to be supported by good policies , " he said .

apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .
nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?
what was he doing in sheerness , and how did he get there ?
as images of the haunted-looking figure went round the world and captured the public imagination , perplexed doctors reported that the man must have suffered some kind of nervous breakdown which had left him mute and stricken with amnesia . while missing persons helplines fielded hundreds of calls from people trying to identify him , the media was quick to pick up on his purported piano skills and floated various theories about his origins - one day , he was believed to be an irish student resident in norway , another day he was identified as a czech concert pianist , while yet another theory had him pegged as a french street musician . suicidal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truth appears to be somewhat less glamorous .
according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .
in fact , all he ever did was tap one key over and over again . " a nurse went into his room last friday and said ' are you going to speak to us today ? '
he simply answered , ' yes , i think i will , " ' a hospital insider told the paper . " he claims he was found by police as he was trying to commit suicide , " she added .
" he was obviously in a distressed state and did n't talk to police .
then it just went from there . " just a hoax allegedly , he also told hospital staff that he was a german who 'd travelled to britain by eurostar .
according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung , he comes from the small town of waldmünchen near the czech border in eastern bavaria .
he also revealed he 'd recently lost a job in paris , was gay , and had two sisters and a father who owned a farm . crucially , he also said that he 'd worked with mentally ill patients .
the revelation clears up at least one mystery - how a suicidal german managed to fool so many people for so long .
experts now believe he copied some of their behavioral mannerisms in order to convince therapists he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
his tactics worked . " his -lrb- behavior -rrb- is very reminiscent of autism , " said one doctor from the british autistic society .
a clinical psychologist from edinburgh university agreed .
" when people are suffering from this kind of catatonia syndrome it could be schizophrenia , " he said . with the piano man now back in germany , the mirror also reports that doctors are considering suing their former patient , arguing that his treatment cost the cash-strapped national health thousands of pounds and wasted expert time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's mental health headache health ministers and ngo representatives from the 52 member states in the world health organization ’ s european region have put their heads together in helsinki this week to discuss the issue of mental health .

how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?
not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches . in the days before stylists fussed over her hair and clothing and before public relations advisors taught her how to smile more , angela merkel was no one 's idea of the perfect chancellor candidate . now , the woman from the eastern german fishing village of templin is a vision in colorful button-down suits , and her face tries its very best to exude a politician 's false warmth . all that 's missing is a little rock n ' roll - and who better to provide that than the granddaddies of the genre themselves ? recently , angela - or angie , as her campaign staff would like germans to think of her - has been leaving the stage following her stump speeches to the strains of the rolling stones ' eponymous song . the soulful wail of mick jagger over a mournful melody of piano and guitar is , apparently , supposed to let germans know that this woman feels their pain .
but did anyone in her coterie think to pay a little bit more to what mick and co. were singing ?
and did anyone ask the kings of rock n ' roll if a conservative chancellor candidate in germany could even use the hit from 1973 ?
the stones say no .

" we did n't grant permission , " said a spokesman for the band over the weekend in great britain 's observer . " we are surprised that permission was not requested .
if it had been , we would have said no . " a merkel spokesman , on the other hand , said the campaign consulted with germany 's music distribution rights agency , which told them they did n't need permission .
the row wo n't likely end up in court , but the candidate 's campaign team wo n't win any points for packaging . merkel , for all her newfound charm and style , still could n't be less rock n ' roll , something the song 's lyrics weirdly seem to acknowledge .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .
it has been really fun . "
world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .
" he is tough and will be able to move the church in a new direction , " said oliver boss , secretary to the archbishop of cologne .

world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .

a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .

world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .
" he is tough and will be able to move the church in a new direction , " said oliver boss , secretary to the archbishop of cologne .
" don ’ t underestimate him .

apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .
nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 piano man is bavarian ... and bogus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not what he seemed germany 's foreign ministry confirmed monday that the unidentified man who washed up on a british beach four months ago is a 20-year-old bavarian .
apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .
nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?
what was he doing in sheerness , and how did he get there ?
as images of the haunted-looking figure went round the world and captured the public imagination , perplexed doctors reported that the man must have suffered some kind of nervous breakdown which had left him mute and stricken with amnesia . while missing persons helplines fielded hundreds of calls from people trying to identify him , the media was quick to pick up on his purported piano skills and floated various theories about his origins - one day , he was believed to be an irish student resident in norway , another day he was identified as a czech concert pianist , while yet another theory had him pegged as a french street musician . suicidal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truth appears to be somewhat less glamorous .
according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .
in fact , all he ever did was tap one key over and over again . " a nurse went into his room last friday and said ' are you going to speak to us today ? '
he simply answered , ' yes , i think i will , " ' a hospital insider told the paper . " he claims he was found by police as he was trying to commit suicide , " she added .
" he was obviously in a distressed state and did n't talk to police .
then it just went from there . " just a hoax allegedly , he also told hospital staff that he was a german who 'd travelled to britain by eurostar .
according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung , he comes from the small town of waldmünchen near the czech border in eastern bavaria .
he also revealed he 'd recently lost a job in paris , was gay , and had two sisters and a father who owned a farm . crucially , he also said that he 'd worked with mentally ill patients .
the revelation clears up at least one mystery - how a suicidal german managed to fool so many people for so long .
experts now believe he copied some of their behavioral mannerisms in order to convince therapists he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
his tactics worked . " his -lrb- behavior -rrb- is very reminiscent of autism , " said one doctor from the british autistic society .
a clinical psychologist from edinburgh university agreed .
" when people are suffering from this kind of catatonia syndrome it could be schizophrenia , " he said . with the piano man now back in germany , the mirror also reports that doctors are considering suing their former patient , arguing that his treatment cost the cash-strapped national health thousands of pounds and wasted expert time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's mental health headache health ministers and ngo representatives from the 52 member states in the world health organization ’ s european region have put their heads together in helsinki this week to discuss the issue of mental health .

crowding around them and adding to the mayhem , a ring of journalists from many of germany 's major media outlets scrambled to capture the action . roth then led the throngs into a turkish diner shop , where she shaved meat from the giant spit while cameras hummed and whirred .

" a serious reason behind the fun the greens have been going out of their way to make a scene in berlin this august to convey a simple message : we are a party that can have fun , and we are a party that still matters for the parliamentary election next month . in the past weeks , interested citizens have been invited by the party 's leadership to explore berlin 's neighborhoods on foot , on skates , and on the water - in a solar-powered boat , of course .

given the current party constellations and the rise of the newly founded left party , the greens need to do everything they can to make themselves apparent , said wolfgang donsbach , a political communications professor at dresden 's technical university . somewhat off-beat campaign events , such as the kreuzberg tour , could help the party if they reach a nationwide audience , he added .
with a new edition of the current governing coalition with the social democrats unlikely and having been overshadowed by the upstart left party as the " hot new thing , " greens must raise their profile somehow or they will run the risk of irrelevancy . repeating previous mistakes ? it 's an approach that 's been -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- tried before .
the green party 's idiosyncratic line-up of publicity events has been turning heads in berlin and perhaps effecting an image change .
but the campaign planners will have to be careful that too much mirth can damage the perception of the greens as a party fit to govern germany . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung recently referred to the " fun campaign of the eco-party , " drawing a parallel to similar attempts by the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- to woo voters during the 2002 election . the fdp garnered the moniker of " fun party " mostly through the antics of party chief guido westerwelle , who was hoping to create a new image with the ambitious goal of reaching 18 percent of the vote .
but westerwelle 's shenanigans failed to grab media attention and linked the fdp with levity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun times did n't last long for the free democrats the result at the polls was certainly not a laughing matter .
despite the " guidomobile " , the flashy yellow motor home westerwelle used to tour germany under the motto " politics can also be fun " ; despite the ' 18 % ' garishly inscribed on his shoe soles ; despite his appearance on the voyeuristic tv show big brother ; or rather , as many say , because of these silly actions , the fdp reached a disappointing 7.4 percent of the vote , putting a jarring end to the party 's summer of fun . optimism backed by plans this summer , the mood for the premature bundestag election campaign is visibly more solemn .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .
it has been really fun . "
world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .
it has been really fun . "
world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 22.08.2005 mixed fortunes for big guns in dfb cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski & co. do n't have to worry about the distractions of the cup now the minnows often relish their chances to take a nip out of the bigger fish but the natural order of things prevailed , for the most part , in the first round of the german cup last week . traditionally the first round of the german cup is one where the smaller clubs get to pit their talents against their better and more financially blessed relatives from the bundesliga .
often it all goes to plan for the big names but sometimes the script gets rewritten . fc cologne may be fifth in the bundesliga table but they crashed out of the german cup at the first hurdle with second division kickers offenbach triumphing 3-1 on saturday . cologne took a 29th minute lead through markus feulner but the sending-off of their zambian midfielder andrew sinkala after 56 minutes changed the complexion of the match . " we had the game under control for an hour and then came the sending off , " said cologne manager uwe rapolder .
" it is a shame to go out and it has shown us that there is work still to do . " qualid mokhtari leveled for offenbach in the 65th minute and suat turker then put the hosts in front seven minutes later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 when the pope and pilgrims have gone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " up the stairs to the jet , holiness " all but a fraction of the one million visitors have now left cologne after world youth day - an accomplishment that went over with only a few hitches . on sunday , one million visitors were trying to leave the marienfeld , a large meadow and formerly an open pit mine , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- west of cologne after having celebrated mass with the pope .
for the organizers , it was a logistical nightmare that guaranteed complications .
a whole stretch of a major autobahn near the western german city was converted into a parking lot and one-way street so that busses could shuttle the young spiritual visitors away from the marienfeld with as little difficulty as possible for them and the expected return of vacationers in the state of north-rhine westphalia , where school starts again this week .
the german railway added an extra 400 trains to get the throngs back to cologne from the makeshift place of worship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict celebrates sunday mass , the climax of the world youth day in cologne dozens of journalists found out personally just what it means to be a pilgrim when they were sent from one exit to the next to find where the shuttle busses were departing .
but at the end of the day , security officials said that the million teens and early 20-year-olds were cooperative .
" all but 6,000 have left cologne -lrb- as of monday morning -rrb- , " was the word from the police .
security tight but seldom needed over the course of pope benedict 's four-day visit to germany , police reported that there were eight security breaches in the air , including a hot-air balloon that soared on saturday night over the marienfeld where wyd held its vigil .
on sunday , the pope-mobile took another route to the marienfeld due to the discovery of what appeared to be a bomb , but later turned out to be a fake .
" the guest was never exposed to a dangerous situation , " was the assessment from cologne 's police chief , klaus steffenhagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence was on hand but there were no major incidents during the six-day event in all , over 4,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia , bordering states and other european countries provided protection for the pope and to assure that matters remained under control .
the police reported that the majority of crimes committed during the span of wyd was primarily theft of articles from backpacks .
home hamlet receives low-flying pope while hundreds of thousands made their way by bus , boat and airplane back to their respective home countries , benedict boarded a plane that was chosen specifically for the pope as it 's named after the bavarian town of regensburg , where the he worked as a university professor for many years and still owns a house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents celebrated the pope 's election in front of the house where he was born on april 19 the residents of benedict 's birthplace , marktl am inn in bavaria , received their most-famous son in an unusual fashion .
it was n't a personal visit , but the pope 's airplane flew low enough for him to see the illuminated city .
the fire brigade shone spotlights on the house where benedict was born joseph ratzinger on april 16 , 1927 .
also , candles were lit to create an effect visible from the air .
it also was not limited to the visual .
from the plane 's cockpit , benedict communicated with marktl residents via radio and prayed with them . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

she also defended the man slated to be her finance minister and his ambitious tax reform plans . smiling a lot more and sitting comfortably in the single seat across from host sabine christiansen , christian democratic candidate angela merkel put on the charm .
it was the same seat in which chancellor gerhard schröder put his talents as an accomplished campaigner on full display two weeks earlier , warmly joking with christiansen and the audience while still appearing statesmanlike .
on sunday night , merkel , who is four points behind schröder in popularity polls , was in the hot seat . luckily for the former east german physicist , germans are voting for parties , not personalities , in the planned sept .
18 elections .
and it 's on the strength of their party platform , and the widespread disappointment in schröder 's economic reforms , that the christian democratic union has built a comfortable lead over the chancellor 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : angela merkel , here with the show 's host , sabine christiansen merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has promised to bring down unemployment by making germany an attractive place for investors .
a key challenge , bringing down the deficit by cutting germany 's debt , will be the job of paul kirchhof , a former constitutional court judge whose ideas have reaped a lot of criticism from party members .
on sunday , merkel went out of her way to stand behind the man she 'll like appoint finance minister in the event of her victory . kirchhof a " visionary " kirchhof 's plans are " visionary , " merkel told christiansen .
she said she saw no major problem with his call for a 25 percent tax rate , which clashes with the cdu platform , saying that kirchhof 's job will be to " push us and spur us on . " the cdu plans a tax reform concept that sets rates between 12 and 39 percent .
that is " a very significant step towards his vision , " she added .
even as most of his party critics returned to toeing the line over the weekend , members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- took further jabs at kirchhof .
dirk niebel , general secretary of the cdu 's likely coalition partners , said his idea was not financially viable at the moment , as a lower rate would cut the government 's tax income . unjust and brutal critics from the spd went even further .
wolfgang thierse , the president of germany 's bundestag , called kirchhof 's plans " seductively simple , brutally unjust and not financially feasible . " kirchhof himself stuck to his guns .
in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel he said he planned to eliminate all 418 tax loopholes in an effort to simplify and improve the tax system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof " if you let one or the other loophole stay , people will ask , ' why this one and not the others ? " ' he said .
kirchhof said last week he wanted a tax system that would allow people to do their taxes in ten minutes .
in the long-term he 's advocating for a system that taxes both people and companies the same regardless of how they make their money . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax reformer tapped for finance post angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .

but thanks to an increasingly wireless world , the " next big thing " in mobile phones is making a comeback . umts - the four letters that stand for universal mobile telecommunications system once sent excited chills through the mobile phone industry , promising fantastic technological leaps and big profits .
nowadays , it 's more likely to be the source of exasperated sighs , as one of the worst investments in the industry 's history . the once hyped umts standard -lrb- also called g3 -rrb- is still waiting for its big break .
an estimated 25 million mobile phones are equipped with the technology , but that number makes up only 1 percent of all phones worldwide . german experts say there are an estimated 500,000 umts clients in germany , including a few hundred thousand clients who surf the internet with their laptop using mobile cards . but only 10 percent of the umts network 's capacity in germany is being used , proof that five years after the country 's biggest telecoms companies handed the government 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.1 billion -rrb- for the right to use the network , the big break has been slow in coming . the next big thing tanks five years ago , the industry could n't get enough umts , widely tipping it to be the " next big thing . "
the massive amounts of data that could travel from mobile to mobile at high speeds promised the advent of television shows watched in the palm of a hand , and internet surfing anywhere on earth . but things have progressed a lot more slowly .
the stock market crash meant telecom companies soon ran out of the cash necessary to build umts networks .
mobile phone manufacturers took longer than expected in working out the technology 's bugs .
the first phones were heavy and clunky and did n't work properly . then came the arrival of a competitor nobody had counted on .
wireless lan networks also promised wireless surfing , for far less money .
at industry events like 2003 's technology trade fair cebit in hanover , germany , some wondered whether umts was on its way out . early-adaptors good for everyone telecom companies soon learned to welcome the competition .
thanks to w-lan technology more and more people are getting used to the concept of wireless surfing , made possible by surfing " hot spots " spread across cities all across the world .
whether it 's dw-world.de , bbc or cnn , all major web portals are now offering the possibility to surf their content with a mobile phone while on the road . bildunterschrift : dw-world readers get a chance to surf on their mobiles the news out of japan that young people are getting more and more used to watching short video clips on their mobiles is as encouraging .
though the price may still be prohibitive , the rates are sinking and it will only be a matter of time for mobile surfing is included in a flat rate offered phone clients when they sign their contracts . vodafone , the world market leader , is certainly optimistic , hoping for close to 10 million umts clients by early 2006 .
whether that will be enough to compensate for the millions spent five years ago is still up in the air .
but , in the end , vodafone , t-mobile and others will probably care less what sort of technology will be used : mobile surfing will make them lot 's of money in the coming years . holger hank -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world 's biggest it fair comes to town cebit , the trade fair that delivers the latest in technological innovation to an increasingly hungry public , opens this week in hanover .
after a number of lean years , exhibitors are gradually returning in numbers .
-lrb- march 7 , 2005 -rrb- third generation mobile phones arrive in germany it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany .

how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?
not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches . in the days before stylists fussed over her hair and clothing and before public relations advisors taught her how to smile more , angela merkel was no one 's idea of the perfect chancellor candidate . now , the woman from the eastern german fishing village of templin is a vision in colorful button-down suits , and her face tries its very best to exude a politician 's false warmth . all that 's missing is a little rock n ' roll - and who better to provide that than the granddaddies of the genre themselves ? recently , angela - or angie , as her campaign staff would like germans to think of her - has been leaving the stage following her stump speeches to the strains of the rolling stones ' eponymous song . the soulful wail of mick jagger over a mournful melody of piano and guitar is , apparently , supposed to let germans know that this woman feels their pain .
but did anyone in her coterie think to pay a little bit more to what mick and co. were singing ?
and did anyone ask the kings of rock n ' roll if a conservative chancellor candidate in germany could even use the hit from 1973 ?
the stones say no .

the row wo n't likely end up in court , but the candidate 's campaign team wo n't win any points for packaging . merkel , for all her newfound charm and style , still could n't be less rock n ' roll , something the song 's lyrics weirdly seem to acknowledge .

"
how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?
not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches . in the days before stylists fussed over her hair and clothing and before public relations advisors taught her how to smile more , angela merkel was no one 's idea of the perfect chancellor candidate . now , the woman from the eastern german fishing village of templin is a vision in colorful button-down suits , and her face tries its very best to exude a politician 's false warmth . all that 's missing is a little rock n ' roll - and who better to provide that than the granddaddies of the genre themselves ? recently , angela - or angie , as her campaign staff would like germans to think of her - has been leaving the stage following her stump speeches to the strains of the rolling stones ' eponymous song . the soulful wail of mick jagger over a mournful melody of piano and guitar is , apparently , supposed to let germans know that this woman feels their pain .
but did anyone in her coterie think to pay a little bit more to what mick and co. were singing ?
and did anyone ask the kings of rock n ' roll if a conservative chancellor candidate in germany could even use the hit from 1973 ?
the stones say no .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolling stones ' mick jagger sings at fenway park in boston on sunday , where the rolling stones opened their " a bigger bang " world tour .
" we did n't grant permission , " said a spokesman for the band over the weekend in great britain 's observer . " we are surprised that permission was not requested .
if it had been , we would have said no . " a merkel spokesman , on the other hand , said the campaign consulted with germany 's music distribution rights agency , which told them they did n't need permission .
the row wo n't likely end up in court , but the candidate 's campaign team wo n't win any points for packaging . merkel , for all her newfound charm and style , still could n't be less rock n ' roll , something the song 's lyrics weirdly seem to acknowledge .
" angie , you 're beautiful , but ai n't it time we said goodbye ? " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern germans not crazy about angela much has been made of the east german roots of angela merkel , christian democratic party head and possibly germany 's first female chancellor .
but in the area she grew up in , she does n't enjoy any hometown advantage .

9 , 2005 -rrb- no sweat , angela chancellor candidate angela merkel 's apricot ensemble attracted all eyes at the premiere of the richard wagner festival .
and some did n't like what they saw , including an editor with a liberal approach towards photoshop .
-lrb- july 28 , 2005 -rrb- a madam chancellor for germany ?
after years of working toward her goal , angela merkel is just a technicality away from running for germany 's highest office .
which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 piano man is bavarian ... and bogus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not what he seemed germany 's foreign ministry confirmed monday that the unidentified man who washed up on a british beach four months ago is a 20-year-old bavarian .
apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .
nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?
what was he doing in sheerness , and how did he get there ?
as images of the haunted-looking figure went round the world and captured the public imagination , perplexed doctors reported that the man must have suffered some kind of nervous breakdown which had left him mute and stricken with amnesia . while missing persons helplines fielded hundreds of calls from people trying to identify him , the media was quick to pick up on his purported piano skills and floated various theories about his origins - one day , he was believed to be an irish student resident in norway , another day he was identified as a czech concert pianist , while yet another theory had him pegged as a french street musician . suicidal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truth appears to be somewhat less glamorous .
according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .
in fact , all he ever did was tap one key over and over again . " a nurse went into his room last friday and said ' are you going to speak to us today ? '
he simply answered , ' yes , i think i will , " ' a hospital insider told the paper . " he claims he was found by police as he was trying to commit suicide , " she added .
" he was obviously in a distressed state and did n't talk to police .

not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches . in the days before stylists fussed over her hair and clothing and before public relations advisors taught her how to smile more , angela merkel was no one 's idea of the perfect chancellor candidate . now , the woman from the eastern german fishing village of templin is a vision in colorful button-down suits , and her face tries its very best to exude a politician 's false warmth . all that 's missing is a little rock n ' roll - and who better to provide that than the granddaddies of the genre themselves ? recently , angela - or angie , as her campaign staff would like germans to think of her - has been leaving the stage following her stump speeches to the strains of the rolling stones ' eponymous song . the soulful wail of mick jagger over a mournful melody of piano and guitar is , apparently , supposed to let germans know that this woman feels their pain .
but did anyone in her coterie think to pay a little bit more to what mick and co. were singing ?
and did anyone ask the kings of rock n ' roll if a conservative chancellor candidate in germany could even use the hit from 1973 ?
the stones say no .

" we did n't grant permission , " said a spokesman for the band over the weekend in great britain 's observer . " we are surprised that permission was not requested .
if it had been , we would have said no . " a merkel spokesman , on the other hand , said the campaign consulted with germany 's music distribution rights agency , which told them they did n't need permission .
the row wo n't likely end up in court , but the candidate 's campaign team wo n't win any points for packaging . merkel , for all her newfound charm and style , still could n't be less rock n ' roll , something the song 's lyrics weirdly seem to acknowledge .

she also defended the man slated to be her finance minister and his ambitious tax reform plans . smiling a lot more and sitting comfortably in the single seat across from host sabine christiansen , christian democratic candidate angela merkel put on the charm .
it was the same seat in which chancellor gerhard schröder put his talents as an accomplished campaigner on full display two weeks earlier , warmly joking with christiansen and the audience while still appearing statesmanlike .
on sunday night , merkel , who is four points behind schröder in popularity polls , was in the hot seat . luckily for the former east german physicist , germans are voting for parties , not personalities , in the planned sept .
18 elections .
and it 's on the strength of their party platform , and the widespread disappointment in schröder 's economic reforms , that the christian democratic union has built a comfortable lead over the chancellor 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : angela merkel , here with the show 's host , sabine christiansen merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has promised to bring down unemployment by making germany an attractive place for investors .
a key challenge , bringing down the deficit by cutting germany 's debt , will be the job of paul kirchhof , a former constitutional court judge whose ideas have reaped a lot of criticism from party members .
on sunday , merkel went out of her way to stand behind the man she 'll like appoint finance minister in the event of her victory . kirchhof a " visionary " kirchhof 's plans are " visionary , " merkel told christiansen .
she said she saw no major problem with his call for a 25 percent tax rate , which clashes with the cdu platform , saying that kirchhof 's job will be to " push us and spur us on . " the cdu plans a tax reform concept that sets rates between 12 and 39 percent .
that is " a very significant step towards his vision , " she added .
even as most of his party critics returned to toeing the line over the weekend , members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- took further jabs at kirchhof .
dirk niebel , general secretary of the cdu 's likely coalition partners , said his idea was not financially viable at the moment , as a lower rate would cut the government 's tax income . unjust and brutal critics from the spd went even further .
wolfgang thierse , the president of germany 's bundestag , called kirchhof 's plans " seductively simple , brutally unjust and not financially feasible . " kirchhof himself stuck to his guns .
in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel he said he planned to eliminate all 418 tax loopholes in an effort to simplify and improve the tax system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof " if you let one or the other loophole stay , people will ask , ' why this one and not the others ? " ' he said .
kirchhof said last week he wanted a tax system that would allow people to do their taxes in ten minutes .
in the long-term he 's advocating for a system that taxes both people and companies the same regardless of how they make their money . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax reformer tapped for finance post angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .

for the organizers , it was a logistical nightmare that guaranteed complications .
a whole stretch of a major autobahn near the western german city was converted into a parking lot and one-way street so that busses could shuttle the young spiritual visitors away from the marienfeld with as little difficulty as possible for them and the expected return of vacationers in the state of north-rhine westphalia , where school starts again this week .
the german railway added an extra 400 trains to get the throngs back to cologne from the makeshift place of worship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict celebrates sunday mass , the climax of the world youth day in cologne dozens of journalists found out personally just what it means to be a pilgrim when they were sent from one exit to the next to find where the shuttle busses were departing .
but at the end of the day , security officials said that the million teens and early 20-year-olds were cooperative .
" all but 6,000 have left cologne -lrb- as of monday morning -rrb- , " was the word from the police .
security tight but seldom needed over the course of pope benedict 's four-day visit to germany , police reported that there were eight security breaches in the air , including a hot-air balloon that soared on saturday night over the marienfeld where wyd held its vigil .
on sunday , the pope-mobile took another route to the marienfeld due to the discovery of what appeared to be a bomb , but later turned out to be a fake .
" the guest was never exposed to a dangerous situation , " was the assessment from cologne 's police chief , klaus steffenhagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence was on hand but there were no major incidents during the six-day event in all , over 4,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia , bordering states and other european countries provided protection for the pope and to assure that matters remained under control .
the police reported that the majority of crimes committed during the span of wyd was primarily theft of articles from backpacks .
home hamlet receives low-flying pope while hundreds of thousands made their way by bus , boat and airplane back to their respective home countries , benedict boarded a plane that was chosen specifically for the pope as it 's named after the bavarian town of regensburg , where the he worked as a university professor for many years and still owns a house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents celebrated the pope 's election in front of the house where he was born on april 19 the residents of benedict 's birthplace , marktl am inn in bavaria , received their most-famous son in an unusual fashion .
it was n't a personal visit , but the pope 's airplane flew low enough for him to see the illuminated city .
the fire brigade shone spotlights on the house where benedict was born joseph ratzinger on april 16 , 1927 .
also , candles were lit to create an effect visible from the air .
it also was not limited to the visual .
from the plane 's cockpit , benedict communicated with marktl residents via radio and prayed with them . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

a water-dropping aircraft from italy was due to join the efforts later against wildfires which circled coimbra , portugal 's third-largest city , and continued to threaten some built-up areas .
but three helicopters from germany , along with 25 anti-fire specialists , would likely not be deployed until tuesday because they will arrive too close to sundown , the agency said .
two fire-fighting helicopters sent from the netherlands were also due to arrive tuesday , dutch officials said . in total over 2,600 firefighters backed by 31 water-dropping aircraft and nearly 800 vehicles were involved in the firefighting operation in portugal , which is facing its worst drought since 1945 . bildunterschrift : european solidarity the president of the european commission , jose barroso , who on sunday visited areas affected by fires in his native portugal where he is on holiday , praised the aid offered by eu nations to portugal .
" we are all very impressed by the size of this problem .
but it is with satisfaction that we watch european solidarity once more at work , " he told reporters in northern portugal , in comments broadcast on lisbon-based tsf radio .
portugal appealed for help from its fellow european union member states on saturday after the number of blazes raging out of control in the country rose above 50 , the highest single day tally so far this year .
the fast-moving wildfires had already charred at least 12 homes on the outskirts of coimbra , located some 200 kilometers of lisbon , and forced the evacuation overnight of some 60 people , local officials said .

his comments echoed those of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who on sunday also called for the eu to set up a joint firefighting force .
ten firefighters have died so far this year battling blazes in portugal which have already destroyed 134,500 hectares -lrb- 332,000 acres -rrb- of land - more than in all of 2004 when just under 130,000 hectares burned . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heat wave fears rise as portugal burns as forest fires continue to rage throughout portugal , a deadly heat wave spreading across southern europe is causing concern in spain and france .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .

as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .

bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "

" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "

" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "

world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .
it has been really fun . "
world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .
" he is tough and will be able to move the church in a new direction , " said oliver boss , secretary to the archbishop of cologne .
" don ’ t underestimate him . " jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope calls on muslims to fight terror pope benedict xvi urged muslim leaders to join christians to help defeat the intolerance which he said was at the root of the terrorist violence seeking to poison ties between the two religions .

apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .

according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .

given the current party constellations and the rise of the newly founded left party , the greens need to do everything they can to make themselves apparent , said wolfgang donsbach , a political communications professor at dresden 's technical university . somewhat off-beat campaign events , such as the kreuzberg tour , could help the party if they reach a nationwide audience , he added .

the green party 's idiosyncratic line-up of publicity events has been turning heads in berlin and perhaps effecting an image change .
but the campaign planners will have to be careful that too much mirth can damage the perception of the greens as a party fit to govern germany . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung recently referred to the " fun campaign of the eco-party , " drawing a parallel to similar attempts by the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- to woo voters during the 2002 election . the fdp garnered the moniker of " fun party " mostly through the antics of party chief guido westerwelle , who was hoping to create a new image with the ambitious goal of reaching 18 percent of the vote .
but westerwelle 's shenanigans failed to grab media attention and linked the fdp with levity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun times did n't last long for the free democrats the result at the polls was certainly not a laughing matter .
despite the " guidomobile " , the flashy yellow motor home westerwelle used to tour germany under the motto " politics can also be fun " ; despite the ' 18 % ' garishly inscribed on his shoe soles ; despite his appearance on the voyeuristic tv show big brother ; or rather , as many say , because of these silly actions , the fdp reached a disappointing 7.4 percent of the vote , putting a jarring end to the party 's summer of fun . optimism backed by plans this summer , the mood for the premature bundestag election campaign is visibly more solemn .
when german voters go to the polls on sept .

" but the greens do n't seem to follow in the fdp 's footsteps , korte added . " they do n't want to be the fun party , but perhaps lighten their image somewhat , " korte said .
" they want to avoid the stigma that ' if it 's green , then it must taste bad . '
they want to develop a profile of wellness . " exuding an optimistic , positive attitude is crucial for the success of a party , donsbach said . the perception of a " good mood " is essential , " but it has to be supported by good policies , " he said .

for the organizers , it was a logistical nightmare that guaranteed complications .
a whole stretch of a major autobahn near the western german city was converted into a parking lot and one-way street so that busses could shuttle the young spiritual visitors away from the marienfeld with as little difficulty as possible for them and the expected return of vacationers in the state of north-rhine westphalia , where school starts again this week .
the german railway added an extra 400 trains to get the throngs back to cologne from the makeshift place of worship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict celebrates sunday mass , the climax of the world youth day in cologne dozens of journalists found out personally just what it means to be a pilgrim when they were sent from one exit to the next to find where the shuttle busses were departing .
but at the end of the day , security officials said that the million teens and early 20-year-olds were cooperative .
" all but 6,000 have left cologne -lrb- as of monday morning -rrb- , " was the word from the police .
security tight but seldom needed over the course of pope benedict 's four-day visit to germany , police reported that there were eight security breaches in the air , including a hot-air balloon that soared on saturday night over the marienfeld where wyd held its vigil .
on sunday , the pope-mobile took another route to the marienfeld due to the discovery of what appeared to be a bomb , but later turned out to be a fake .
" the guest was never exposed to a dangerous situation , " was the assessment from cologne 's police chief , klaus steffenhagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence was on hand but there were no major incidents during the six-day event in all , over 4,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia , bordering states and other european countries provided protection for the pope and to assure that matters remained under control .
the police reported that the majority of crimes committed during the span of wyd was primarily theft of articles from backpacks .
home hamlet receives low-flying pope while hundreds of thousands made their way by bus , boat and airplane back to their respective home countries , benedict boarded a plane that was chosen specifically for the pope as it 's named after the bavarian town of regensburg , where the he worked as a university professor for many years and still owns a house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents celebrated the pope 's election in front of the house where he was born on april 19 the residents of benedict 's birthplace , marktl am inn in bavaria , received their most-famous son in an unusual fashion .
it was n't a personal visit , but the pope 's airplane flew low enough for him to see the illuminated city .
the fire brigade shone spotlights on the house where benedict was born joseph ratzinger on april 16 , 1927 .
also , candles were lit to create an effect visible from the air .
it also was not limited to the visual .
from the plane 's cockpit , benedict communicated with marktl residents via radio and prayed with them . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

a water-dropping aircraft from italy was due to join the efforts later against wildfires which circled coimbra , portugal 's third-largest city , and continued to threaten some built-up areas .
but three helicopters from germany , along with 25 anti-fire specialists , would likely not be deployed until tuesday because they will arrive too close to sundown , the agency said .
two fire-fighting helicopters sent from the netherlands were also due to arrive tuesday , dutch officials said . in total over 2,600 firefighters backed by 31 water-dropping aircraft and nearly 800 vehicles were involved in the firefighting operation in portugal , which is facing its worst drought since 1945 . bildunterschrift : european solidarity the president of the european commission , jose barroso , who on sunday visited areas affected by fires in his native portugal where he is on holiday , praised the aid offered by eu nations to portugal .
" we are all very impressed by the size of this problem .
but it is with satisfaction that we watch european solidarity once more at work , " he told reporters in northern portugal , in comments broadcast on lisbon-based tsf radio .
portugal appealed for help from its fellow european union member states on saturday after the number of blazes raging out of control in the country rose above 50 , the highest single day tally so far this year .
the fast-moving wildfires had already charred at least 12 homes on the outskirts of coimbra , located some 200 kilometers of lisbon , and forced the evacuation overnight of some 60 people , local officials said .
with a change in wind direction , coimbra itself was no longer threatened by the flames , but firefighters were on guard against the possibility of flare-ups in the charred areas near the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was a terrible night for the people of the city and for everyone involved in fighting the fire , " the governor of the district of coimbra , henrique fernandes , told state television rtp .
forecasters meanwhile predicted temperatures would soar above a scorching 35 degrees celsius -lrb- 95 fahrenheit -rrb- in some areas , raising the risk of new fires , and remain high until at least wednesday .
emergency workers were evacuating residents from a village near coimbra because of the the threat from the thick smoke and advancing flames , tsf reported . police said at least five roads in the center and north of the country were closed because of the flames and smoke . calls for joint fire-fighting force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on french radio , interior minister antonio costa said meanwhile that europe should combine its resources in fighting fires , notably by jointly building specialized water-bombing aircraft .
" it is essential to pool our resources because we have fires in portugal , but tomorrow there could be others in spain , in italy , in greece , " costa told french radio station europe 1 .
his comments echoed those of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who on sunday also called for the eu to set up a joint firefighting force .
ten firefighters have died so far this year battling blazes in portugal which have already destroyed 134,500 hectares -lrb- 332,000 acres -rrb- of land - more than in all of 2004 when just under 130,000 hectares burned . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heat wave fears rise as portugal burns as forest fires continue to rage throughout portugal , a deadly heat wave spreading across southern europe is causing concern in spain and france .

it was the same seat in which chancellor gerhard schröder put his talents as an accomplished campaigner on full display two weeks earlier , warmly joking with christiansen and the audience while still appearing statesmanlike .
on sunday night , merkel , who is four points behind schröder in popularity polls , was in the hot seat . luckily for the former east german physicist , germans are voting for parties , not personalities , in the planned sept .

that is " a very significant step towards his vision , " she added .
even as most of his party critics returned to toeing the line over the weekend , members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- took further jabs at kirchhof .
dirk niebel , general secretary of the cdu 's likely coalition partners , said his idea was not financially viable at the moment , as a lower rate would cut the government 's tax income . unjust and brutal critics from the spd went even further .
wolfgang thierse , the president of germany 's bundestag , called kirchhof 's plans " seductively simple , brutally unjust and not financially feasible . " kirchhof himself stuck to his guns .

a water-dropping aircraft from italy was due to join the efforts later against wildfires which circled coimbra , portugal 's third-largest city , and continued to threaten some built-up areas .
but three helicopters from germany , along with 25 anti-fire specialists , would likely not be deployed until tuesday because they will arrive too close to sundown , the agency said .
two fire-fighting helicopters sent from the netherlands were also due to arrive tuesday , dutch officials said . in total over 2,600 firefighters backed by 31 water-dropping aircraft and nearly 800 vehicles were involved in the firefighting operation in portugal , which is facing its worst drought since 1945 . bildunterschrift : european solidarity the president of the european commission , jose barroso , who on sunday visited areas affected by fires in his native portugal where he is on holiday , praised the aid offered by eu nations to portugal .
" we are all very impressed by the size of this problem .
but it is with satisfaction that we watch european solidarity once more at work , " he told reporters in northern portugal , in comments broadcast on lisbon-based tsf radio .
portugal appealed for help from its fellow european union member states on saturday after the number of blazes raging out of control in the country rose above 50 , the highest single day tally so far this year .
the fast-moving wildfires had already charred at least 12 homes on the outskirts of coimbra , located some 200 kilometers of lisbon , and forced the evacuation overnight of some 60 people , local officials said .
with a change in wind direction , coimbra itself was no longer threatened by the flames , but firefighters were on guard against the possibility of flare-ups in the charred areas near the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was a terrible night for the people of the city and for everyone involved in fighting the fire , " the governor of the district of coimbra , henrique fernandes , told state television rtp .

emergency workers were evacuating residents from a village near coimbra because of the the threat from the thick smoke and advancing flames , tsf reported . police said at least five roads in the center and north of the country were closed because of the flames and smoke . calls for joint fire-fighting force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on french radio , interior minister antonio costa said meanwhile that europe should combine its resources in fighting fires , notably by jointly building specialized water-bombing aircraft .
" it is essential to pool our resources because we have fires in portugal , but tomorrow there could be others in spain , in italy , in greece , " costa told french radio station europe 1 .
his comments echoed those of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who on sunday also called for the eu to set up a joint firefighting force .
ten firefighters have died so far this year battling blazes in portugal which have already destroyed 134,500 hectares -lrb- 332,000 acres -rrb- of land - more than in all of 2004 when just under 130,000 hectares burned . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heat wave fears rise as portugal burns as forest fires continue to rage throughout portugal , a deadly heat wave spreading across southern europe is causing concern in spain and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 when the pope and pilgrims have gone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " up the stairs to the jet , holiness " all but a fraction of the one million visitors have now left cologne after world youth day - an accomplishment that went over with only a few hitches . on sunday , one million visitors were trying to leave the marienfeld , a large meadow and formerly an open pit mine , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- west of cologne after having celebrated mass with the pope .
for the organizers , it was a logistical nightmare that guaranteed complications .
a whole stretch of a major autobahn near the western german city was converted into a parking lot and one-way street so that busses could shuttle the young spiritual visitors away from the marienfeld with as little difficulty as possible for them and the expected return of vacationers in the state of north-rhine westphalia , where school starts again this week .
the german railway added an extra 400 trains to get the throngs back to cologne from the makeshift place of worship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict celebrates sunday mass , the climax of the world youth day in cologne dozens of journalists found out personally just what it means to be a pilgrim when they were sent from one exit to the next to find where the shuttle busses were departing .
but at the end of the day , security officials said that the million teens and early 20-year-olds were cooperative .
" all but 6,000 have left cologne -lrb- as of monday morning -rrb- , " was the word from the police .
security tight but seldom needed over the course of pope benedict 's four-day visit to germany , police reported that there were eight security breaches in the air , including a hot-air balloon that soared on saturday night over the marienfeld where wyd held its vigil .
on sunday , the pope-mobile took another route to the marienfeld due to the discovery of what appeared to be a bomb , but later turned out to be a fake .
" the guest was never exposed to a dangerous situation , " was the assessment from cologne 's police chief , klaus steffenhagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence was on hand but there were no major incidents during the six-day event in all , over 4,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia , bordering states and other european countries provided protection for the pope and to assure that matters remained under control .
the police reported that the majority of crimes committed during the span of wyd was primarily theft of articles from backpacks .
home hamlet receives low-flying pope while hundreds of thousands made their way by bus , boat and airplane back to their respective home countries , benedict boarded a plane that was chosen specifically for the pope as it 's named after the bavarian town of regensburg , where the he worked as a university professor for many years and still owns a house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents celebrated the pope 's election in front of the house where he was born on april 19 the residents of benedict 's birthplace , marktl am inn in bavaria , received their most-famous son in an unusual fashion .
it was n't a personal visit , but the pope 's airplane flew low enough for him to see the illuminated city .
the fire brigade shone spotlights on the house where benedict was born joseph ratzinger on april 16 , 1927 .
also , candles were lit to create an effect visible from the air .
it also was not limited to the visual .
from the plane 's cockpit , benedict communicated with marktl residents via radio and prayed with them . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

two fire-fighting helicopters sent from the netherlands were also due to arrive tuesday , dutch officials said . in total over 2,600 firefighters backed by 31 water-dropping aircraft and nearly 800 vehicles were involved in the firefighting operation in portugal , which is facing its worst drought since 1945 . bildunterschrift : european solidarity the president of the european commission , jose barroso , who on sunday visited areas affected by fires in his native portugal where he is on holiday , praised the aid offered by eu nations to portugal .
" we are all very impressed by the size of this problem .
but it is with satisfaction that we watch european solidarity once more at work , " he told reporters in northern portugal , in comments broadcast on lisbon-based tsf radio .
portugal appealed for help from its fellow european union member states on saturday after the number of blazes raging out of control in the country rose above 50 , the highest single day tally so far this year .
the fast-moving wildfires had already charred at least 12 homes on the outskirts of coimbra , located some 200 kilometers of lisbon , and forced the evacuation overnight of some 60 people , local officials said .
with a change in wind direction , coimbra itself was no longer threatened by the flames , but firefighters were on guard against the possibility of flare-ups in the charred areas near the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was a terrible night for the people of the city and for everyone involved in fighting the fire , " the governor of the district of coimbra , henrique fernandes , told state television rtp .
forecasters meanwhile predicted temperatures would soar above a scorching 35 degrees celsius -lrb- 95 fahrenheit -rrb- in some areas , raising the risk of new fires , and remain high until at least wednesday .
emergency workers were evacuating residents from a village near coimbra because of the the threat from the thick smoke and advancing flames , tsf reported . police said at least five roads in the center and north of the country were closed because of the flames and smoke . calls for joint fire-fighting force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on french radio , interior minister antonio costa said meanwhile that europe should combine its resources in fighting fires , notably by jointly building specialized water-bombing aircraft .
" it is essential to pool our resources because we have fires in portugal , but tomorrow there could be others in spain , in italy , in greece , " costa told french radio station europe 1 .
his comments echoed those of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who on sunday also called for the eu to set up a joint firefighting force .
ten firefighters have died so far this year battling blazes in portugal which have already destroyed 134,500 hectares -lrb- 332,000 acres -rrb- of land - more than in all of 2004 when just under 130,000 hectares burned . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heat wave fears rise as portugal burns as forest fires continue to rage throughout portugal , a deadly heat wave spreading across southern europe is causing concern in spain and france .

for the organizers , it was a logistical nightmare that guaranteed complications .
a whole stretch of a major autobahn near the western german city was converted into a parking lot and one-way street so that busses could shuttle the young spiritual visitors away from the marienfeld with as little difficulty as possible for them and the expected return of vacationers in the state of north-rhine westphalia , where school starts again this week .
the german railway added an extra 400 trains to get the throngs back to cologne from the makeshift place of worship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict celebrates sunday mass , the climax of the world youth day in cologne dozens of journalists found out personally just what it means to be a pilgrim when they were sent from one exit to the next to find where the shuttle busses were departing .
but at the end of the day , security officials said that the million teens and early 20-year-olds were cooperative .
" all but 6,000 have left cologne -lrb- as of monday morning -rrb- , " was the word from the police .
security tight but seldom needed over the course of pope benedict 's four-day visit to germany , police reported that there were eight security breaches in the air , including a hot-air balloon that soared on saturday night over the marienfeld where wyd held its vigil .
on sunday , the pope-mobile took another route to the marienfeld due to the discovery of what appeared to be a bomb , but later turned out to be a fake .
" the guest was never exposed to a dangerous situation , " was the assessment from cologne 's police chief , klaus steffenhagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence was on hand but there were no major incidents during the six-day event in all , over 4,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia , bordering states and other european countries provided protection for the pope and to assure that matters remained under control .
the police reported that the majority of crimes committed during the span of wyd was primarily theft of articles from backpacks .
home hamlet receives low-flying pope while hundreds of thousands made their way by bus , boat and airplane back to their respective home countries , benedict boarded a plane that was chosen specifically for the pope as it 's named after the bavarian town of regensburg , where the he worked as a university professor for many years and still owns a house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents celebrated the pope 's election in front of the house where he was born on april 19 the residents of benedict 's birthplace , marktl am inn in bavaria , received their most-famous son in an unusual fashion .
it was n't a personal visit , but the pope 's airplane flew low enough for him to see the illuminated city .
the fire brigade shone spotlights on the house where benedict was born joseph ratzinger on april 16 , 1927 .
also , candles were lit to create an effect visible from the air .
it also was not limited to the visual .
from the plane 's cockpit , benedict communicated with marktl residents via radio and prayed with them . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 benedict : an effective faith-offensive ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi was welcomed like a pop star at the open air mass the successor to the charismatic john paul ii has been under close scrutiny on his first foreign visit as pope as to whether he can inspire the young as his predecessor did .
many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .

world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .

but thanks to an increasingly wireless world , the " next big thing " in mobile phones is making a comeback . umts - the four letters that stand for universal mobile telecommunications system once sent excited chills through the mobile phone industry , promising fantastic technological leaps and big profits .
nowadays , it 's more likely to be the source of exasperated sighs , as one of the worst investments in the industry 's history . the once hyped umts standard -lrb- also called g3 -rrb- is still waiting for its big break .
an estimated 25 million mobile phones are equipped with the technology , but that number makes up only 1 percent of all phones worldwide . german experts say there are an estimated 500,000 umts clients in germany , including a few hundred thousand clients who surf the internet with their laptop using mobile cards . but only 10 percent of the umts network 's capacity in germany is being used , proof that five years after the country 's biggest telecoms companies handed the government 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.1 billion -rrb- for the right to use the network , the big break has been slow in coming . the next big thing tanks five years ago , the industry could n't get enough umts , widely tipping it to be the " next big thing . "
the massive amounts of data that could travel from mobile to mobile at high speeds promised the advent of television shows watched in the palm of a hand , and internet surfing anywhere on earth . but things have progressed a lot more slowly .
the stock market crash meant telecom companies soon ran out of the cash necessary to build umts networks .
mobile phone manufacturers took longer than expected in working out the technology 's bugs .
the first phones were heavy and clunky and did n't work properly . then came the arrival of a competitor nobody had counted on .
wireless lan networks also promised wireless surfing , for far less money .
at industry events like 2003 's technology trade fair cebit in hanover , germany , some wondered whether umts was on its way out . early-adaptors good for everyone telecom companies soon learned to welcome the competition .
thanks to w-lan technology more and more people are getting used to the concept of wireless surfing , made possible by surfing " hot spots " spread across cities all across the world .
whether it 's dw-world.de , bbc or cnn , all major web portals are now offering the possibility to surf their content with a mobile phone while on the road . bildunterschrift : dw-world readers get a chance to surf on their mobiles the news out of japan that young people are getting more and more used to watching short video clips on their mobiles is as encouraging .
though the price may still be prohibitive , the rates are sinking and it will only be a matter of time for mobile surfing is included in a flat rate offered phone clients when they sign their contracts . vodafone , the world market leader , is certainly optimistic , hoping for close to 10 million umts clients by early 2006 .
whether that will be enough to compensate for the millions spent five years ago is still up in the air .
but , in the end , vodafone , t-mobile and others will probably care less what sort of technology will be used : mobile surfing will make them lot 's of money in the coming years . holger hank -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world 's biggest it fair comes to town cebit , the trade fair that delivers the latest in technological innovation to an increasingly hungry public , opens this week in hanover .
after a number of lean years , exhibitors are gradually returning in numbers .

the employees will be allowed to continue working in a joint venture with an external partner , the paper said . the chief of opel 's workers ' union , klaus franz , said that the plan was contrary to the contract agreed on in march , but gm disagreed .
general motors ' europe speaker , rüdiger assion , said that outsourcing plans had been part of the contract from the beginning , and that it was planned all along to move the 100 bochum jobs to an external contractor .
the opel workers ' union nonetheless applied for a provisional order at a court in bochum , which resulted in the planned outsourcing being postponed until november 30th .
until then , the opel workers ' union will negotiate with opel 's management . dw-world.de gm reveals cuts at opel general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 benedict : an effective faith-offensive ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi was welcomed like a pop star at the open air mass the successor to the charismatic john paul ii has been under close scrutiny on his first foreign visit as pope as to whether he can inspire the young as his predecessor did .
many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .
it has been really fun . "
world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .
" he is tough and will be able to move the church in a new direction , " said oliver boss , secretary to the archbishop of cologne .

she also defended the man slated to be her finance minister and his ambitious tax reform plans . smiling a lot more and sitting comfortably in the single seat across from host sabine christiansen , christian democratic candidate angela merkel put on the charm .
it was the same seat in which chancellor gerhard schröder put his talents as an accomplished campaigner on full display two weeks earlier , warmly joking with christiansen and the audience while still appearing statesmanlike .
on sunday night , merkel , who is four points behind schröder in popularity polls , was in the hot seat . luckily for the former east german physicist , germans are voting for parties , not personalities , in the planned sept .
18 elections .
and it 's on the strength of their party platform , and the widespread disappointment in schröder 's economic reforms , that the christian democratic union has built a comfortable lead over the chancellor 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : angela merkel , here with the show 's host , sabine christiansen merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has promised to bring down unemployment by making germany an attractive place for investors .
a key challenge , bringing down the deficit by cutting germany 's debt , will be the job of paul kirchhof , a former constitutional court judge whose ideas have reaped a lot of criticism from party members .
on sunday , merkel went out of her way to stand behind the man she 'll like appoint finance minister in the event of her victory . kirchhof a " visionary " kirchhof 's plans are " visionary , " merkel told christiansen .
she said she saw no major problem with his call for a 25 percent tax rate , which clashes with the cdu platform , saying that kirchhof 's job will be to " push us and spur us on . " the cdu plans a tax reform concept that sets rates between 12 and 39 percent .
that is " a very significant step towards his vision , " she added .
even as most of his party critics returned to toeing the line over the weekend , members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- took further jabs at kirchhof .
dirk niebel , general secretary of the cdu 's likely coalition partners , said his idea was not financially viable at the moment , as a lower rate would cut the government 's tax income . unjust and brutal critics from the spd went even further .
wolfgang thierse , the president of germany 's bundestag , called kirchhof 's plans " seductively simple , brutally unjust and not financially feasible . " kirchhof himself stuck to his guns .
in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel he said he planned to eliminate all 418 tax loopholes in an effort to simplify and improve the tax system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof " if you let one or the other loophole stay , people will ask , ' why this one and not the others ? " ' he said .
kirchhof said last week he wanted a tax system that would allow people to do their taxes in ten minutes .
in the long-term he 's advocating for a system that taxes both people and companies the same regardless of how they make their money . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax reformer tapped for finance post angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .

often it all goes to plan for the big names but sometimes the script gets rewritten . fc cologne may be fifth in the bundesliga table but they crashed out of the german cup at the first hurdle with second division kickers offenbach triumphing 3-1 on saturday . cologne took a 29th minute lead through markus feulner but the sending-off of their zambian midfielder andrew sinkala after 56 minutes changed the complexion of the match . " we had the game under control for an hour and then came the sending off , " said cologne manager uwe rapolder .
" it is a shame to go out and it has shown us that there is work still to do . " qualid mokhtari leveled for offenbach in the 65th minute and suat turker then put the hosts in front seven minutes later .
former german international christian rahn scored an own goal four minutes from time to seal 10-man cologne 's misery . on the following monday dortmund were beaten 2-1 by the second division side eintracht braunschweig in a match watched by a passionate home crowd of 22,200 . jan koller gave bvb the lead on 28 minutes , but a brilliant diving header by jürgen rische on 41 and a dramatic 84th-minute strike from captain daniel graf took the underdogs into the second round and dumped the woeful big league visitors out of the cup . the other bundesliga teams in action over the weekend had little trouble in securing passage to the second round and big guns such as bayer leverkusen , werder bremen and sv hamburg were in fine form . most bundesliga sides progress at a stroll leverkusen crushed rot-weiss erfurt amateure 8-0 with serbia and montenegro star danko lazovic scoring a hat-trick inside ten minutes midway through the second half . " it was a great day for me , " lazovic said .
" i am just glad to have this chance at a great club like leverkusen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen , winners in 2004 , ran out 3-1 victors over wattenscheid while hamburg hammered stuttgart kickers 5-1 . hamburg crashed out 4-2 to sc paderborn in the first round of last season 's competition although it was later revealed that disgraced referee robert hoyer had manipulated the tie for financial gain . last season 's quarter-finalists paderborn had no time for giant killing this time around as they fell 2-0 to vfl wolfsburg . schalke 04 were runners-up to bayern munich in last season 's final and they justified their favorite tag with a 3-0 thrashing of unknowns bremerhaven . danish international soren larsen continues to shine since arriving in the close season scoring twice to help the visitors ease through . it was far from easy for bundesliga outfit hertha berlin who needed extra-time to defeat koblenz 3-2 . hertha were 2-1 down at one stage but brazilian marcelinho equalized and niko kovac scored the winner to save the club 's blushes . stuttgart let out of jail with extra-time victory vfb stuttgart had a scare against amateur club tsg hoffenheim on sunday .
the home side scraped through to the second round of the german cup with a 4-3 extra-time win .
the early season crisis , in which stuttgart have taken just a point from their opening two bundesliga matches , looked to be going from bad to worse when they fell 2-1 behind to the regional third division side at the end of the first half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new signing jon dahl tomasson equalized in the 54th minute to send the match into extra-time , however , and goals from croatia 's mario carevic and brazilian forward cacau sent them clear . hoffenheim defender matthias orum pulled one back late in the game but stuttgart held on for a much needed victory . cup holders bayern munich made light work of msv 1919 neuruppin in berlin on sunday , winning 4-0 in their first game of their defense . two goals from golden oldie mehmet scholl sealed the win after valerien ismael had opened the scoring with his first goal for bayern since his pre-season move from werder bremen .

not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches . in the days before stylists fussed over her hair and clothing and before public relations advisors taught her how to smile more , angela merkel was no one 's idea of the perfect chancellor candidate . now , the woman from the eastern german fishing village of templin is a vision in colorful button-down suits , and her face tries its very best to exude a politician 's false warmth . all that 's missing is a little rock n ' roll - and who better to provide that than the granddaddies of the genre themselves ? recently , angela - or angie , as her campaign staff would like germans to think of her - has been leaving the stage following her stump speeches to the strains of the rolling stones ' eponymous song . the soulful wail of mick jagger over a mournful melody of piano and guitar is , apparently , supposed to let germans know that this woman feels their pain .
but did anyone in her coterie think to pay a little bit more to what mick and co. were singing ?

not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches . in the days before stylists fussed over her hair and clothing and before public relations advisors taught her how to smile more , angela merkel was no one 's idea of the perfect chancellor candidate . now , the woman from the eastern german fishing village of templin is a vision in colorful button-down suits , and her face tries its very best to exude a politician 's false warmth . all that 's missing is a little rock n ' roll - and who better to provide that than the granddaddies of the genre themselves ? recently , angela - or angie , as her campaign staff would like germans to think of her - has been leaving the stage following her stump speeches to the strains of the rolling stones ' eponymous song . the soulful wail of mick jagger over a mournful melody of piano and guitar is , apparently , supposed to let germans know that this woman feels their pain .
but did anyone in her coterie think to pay a little bit more to what mick and co. were singing ?
and did anyone ask the kings of rock n ' roll if a conservative chancellor candidate in germany could even use the hit from 1973 ?
the stones say no .

often it all goes to plan for the big names but sometimes the script gets rewritten . fc cologne may be fifth in the bundesliga table but they crashed out of the german cup at the first hurdle with second division kickers offenbach triumphing 3-1 on saturday . cologne took a 29th minute lead through markus feulner but the sending-off of their zambian midfielder andrew sinkala after 56 minutes changed the complexion of the match . " we had the game under control for an hour and then came the sending off , " said cologne manager uwe rapolder .
" it is a shame to go out and it has shown us that there is work still to do . " qualid mokhtari leveled for offenbach in the 65th minute and suat turker then put the hosts in front seven minutes later .
former german international christian rahn scored an own goal four minutes from time to seal 10-man cologne 's misery . on the following monday dortmund were beaten 2-1 by the second division side eintracht braunschweig in a match watched by a passionate home crowd of 22,200 . jan koller gave bvb the lead on 28 minutes , but a brilliant diving header by jürgen rische on 41 and a dramatic 84th-minute strike from captain daniel graf took the underdogs into the second round and dumped the woeful big league visitors out of the cup . the other bundesliga teams in action over the weekend had little trouble in securing passage to the second round and big guns such as bayer leverkusen , werder bremen and sv hamburg were in fine form . most bundesliga sides progress at a stroll leverkusen crushed rot-weiss erfurt amateure 8-0 with serbia and montenegro star danko lazovic scoring a hat-trick inside ten minutes midway through the second half . " it was a great day for me , " lazovic said .
" i am just glad to have this chance at a great club like leverkusen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen , winners in 2004 , ran out 3-1 victors over wattenscheid while hamburg hammered stuttgart kickers 5-1 . hamburg crashed out 4-2 to sc paderborn in the first round of last season 's competition although it was later revealed that disgraced referee robert hoyer had manipulated the tie for financial gain . last season 's quarter-finalists paderborn had no time for giant killing this time around as they fell 2-0 to vfl wolfsburg . schalke 04 were runners-up to bayern munich in last season 's final and they justified their favorite tag with a 3-0 thrashing of unknowns bremerhaven . danish international soren larsen continues to shine since arriving in the close season scoring twice to help the visitors ease through . it was far from easy for bundesliga outfit hertha berlin who needed extra-time to defeat koblenz 3-2 . hertha were 2-1 down at one stage but brazilian marcelinho equalized and niko kovac scored the winner to save the club 's blushes . stuttgart let out of jail with extra-time victory vfb stuttgart had a scare against amateur club tsg hoffenheim on sunday .
the home side scraped through to the second round of the german cup with a 4-3 extra-time win .
the early season crisis , in which stuttgart have taken just a point from their opening two bundesliga matches , looked to be going from bad to worse when they fell 2-1 behind to the regional third division side at the end of the first half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new signing jon dahl tomasson equalized in the 54th minute to send the match into extra-time , however , and goals from croatia 's mario carevic and brazilian forward cacau sent them clear . hoffenheim defender matthias orum pulled one back late in the game but stuttgart held on for a much needed victory . cup holders bayern munich made light work of msv 1919 neuruppin in berlin on sunday , winning 4-0 in their first game of their defense . two goals from golden oldie mehmet scholl sealed the win after valerien ismael had opened the scoring with his first goal for bayern since his pre-season move from werder bremen .
youngster andreas ottl also got his first senior goal to ease the champions ' passage to the next round . while not such a giant force in their own league , hanover 96 are positively enormous compared to cologne amateurs who play in the regional third division .
the miss-matched tie on friday evening offered few surprises with the bundesliga outfit putting four past the youth team without reply . vahid hashemian , the iranian international signed by hanover from bayern munich , opened the scoring in the sixth minute .
hanover finished the game at a stroll after cologne 's tobias nickenig was sent off midway through the first half and completed the rout with goals from thomas brdaric , chavdar yankov and jiri stajner . the other top league side in action on friday was recently promoted eintracht frankfurt who won in less comfortable circumstances against rot-weiss oberhausen , holding on to a 2-1 victory for their first win of the season . new signings benjamin huggel and ioannis amanatidis put frankfurt 2-0 up before dalibor gataric 's reply 13 minutes from time set up a nervous finale . cottbus keeper the saviour and hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pick of the other six matches was the cliff-hanger between second division energie cottbus and amateurs rot-weiss essen which finished in favor of the professionals from the east after a dramatic penalty shoot-out which cottbus won 5-4 . the hero of the night was energie 's bosnian goalkeeper tomislav piplica -lrb- photo , right -rrb- who saved from lennart lynge larsen at 4-4 in the shootout before scoring the winner himself . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big names hoping to avoid cup slip-ups while there is no league action this weekend , bundesliga sides are still facing challenges in the first round of the dfb cup which traditionally throws davids and goliaths together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 piano man is bavarian ... and bogus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not what he seemed germany 's foreign ministry confirmed monday that the unidentified man who washed up on a british beach four months ago is a 20-year-old bavarian .
apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .
nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?
what was he doing in sheerness , and how did he get there ?
as images of the haunted-looking figure went round the world and captured the public imagination , perplexed doctors reported that the man must have suffered some kind of nervous breakdown which had left him mute and stricken with amnesia . while missing persons helplines fielded hundreds of calls from people trying to identify him , the media was quick to pick up on his purported piano skills and floated various theories about his origins - one day , he was believed to be an irish student resident in norway , another day he was identified as a czech concert pianist , while yet another theory had him pegged as a french street musician . suicidal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truth appears to be somewhat less glamorous .
according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .
in fact , all he ever did was tap one key over and over again . " a nurse went into his room last friday and said ' are you going to speak to us today ? '
he simply answered , ' yes , i think i will , " ' a hospital insider told the paper . " he claims he was found by police as he was trying to commit suicide , " she added .
" he was obviously in a distressed state and did n't talk to police .
then it just went from there . " just a hoax allegedly , he also told hospital staff that he was a german who 'd travelled to britain by eurostar .
according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung , he comes from the small town of waldmünchen near the czech border in eastern bavaria .
he also revealed he 'd recently lost a job in paris , was gay , and had two sisters and a father who owned a farm . crucially , he also said that he 'd worked with mentally ill patients .
the revelation clears up at least one mystery - how a suicidal german managed to fool so many people for so long .
experts now believe he copied some of their behavioral mannerisms in order to convince therapists he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
his tactics worked . " his -lrb- behavior -rrb- is very reminiscent of autism , " said one doctor from the british autistic society .
a clinical psychologist from edinburgh university agreed .

apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .
nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?
what was he doing in sheerness , and how did he get there ?
as images of the haunted-looking figure went round the world and captured the public imagination , perplexed doctors reported that the man must have suffered some kind of nervous breakdown which had left him mute and stricken with amnesia . while missing persons helplines fielded hundreds of calls from people trying to identify him , the media was quick to pick up on his purported piano skills and floated various theories about his origins - one day , he was believed to be an irish student resident in norway , another day he was identified as a czech concert pianist , while yet another theory had him pegged as a french street musician . suicidal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truth appears to be somewhat less glamorous .
according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .
in fact , all he ever did was tap one key over and over again . " a nurse went into his room last friday and said ' are you going to speak to us today ? '
he simply answered , ' yes , i think i will , " ' a hospital insider told the paper . " he claims he was found by police as he was trying to commit suicide , " she added .
" he was obviously in a distressed state and did n't talk to police .
then it just went from there . " just a hoax allegedly , he also told hospital staff that he was a german who 'd travelled to britain by eurostar .
according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung , he comes from the small town of waldmünchen near the czech border in eastern bavaria .
he also revealed he 'd recently lost a job in paris , was gay , and had two sisters and a father who owned a farm . crucially , he also said that he 'd worked with mentally ill patients .
the revelation clears up at least one mystery - how a suicidal german managed to fool so many people for so long .
experts now believe he copied some of their behavioral mannerisms in order to convince therapists he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
his tactics worked . " his -lrb- behavior -rrb- is very reminiscent of autism , " said one doctor from the british autistic society .
a clinical psychologist from edinburgh university agreed .
" when people are suffering from this kind of catatonia syndrome it could be schizophrenia , " he said . with the piano man now back in germany , the mirror also reports that doctors are considering suing their former patient , arguing that his treatment cost the cash-strapped national health thousands of pounds and wasted expert time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's mental health headache health ministers and ngo representatives from the 52 member states in the world health organization ’ s european region have put their heads together in helsinki this week to discuss the issue of mental health .

a water-dropping aircraft from italy was due to join the efforts later against wildfires which circled coimbra , portugal 's third-largest city , and continued to threaten some built-up areas .
but three helicopters from germany , along with 25 anti-fire specialists , would likely not be deployed until tuesday because they will arrive too close to sundown , the agency said .
two fire-fighting helicopters sent from the netherlands were also due to arrive tuesday , dutch officials said . in total over 2,600 firefighters backed by 31 water-dropping aircraft and nearly 800 vehicles were involved in the firefighting operation in portugal , which is facing its worst drought since 1945 . bildunterschrift : european solidarity the president of the european commission , jose barroso , who on sunday visited areas affected by fires in his native portugal where he is on holiday , praised the aid offered by eu nations to portugal .
" we are all very impressed by the size of this problem .
but it is with satisfaction that we watch european solidarity once more at work , " he told reporters in northern portugal , in comments broadcast on lisbon-based tsf radio .
portugal appealed for help from its fellow european union member states on saturday after the number of blazes raging out of control in the country rose above 50 , the highest single day tally so far this year .
the fast-moving wildfires had already charred at least 12 homes on the outskirts of coimbra , located some 200 kilometers of lisbon , and forced the evacuation overnight of some 60 people , local officials said .
with a change in wind direction , coimbra itself was no longer threatened by the flames , but firefighters were on guard against the possibility of flare-ups in the charred areas near the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was a terrible night for the people of the city and for everyone involved in fighting the fire , " the governor of the district of coimbra , henrique fernandes , told state television rtp .
forecasters meanwhile predicted temperatures would soar above a scorching 35 degrees celsius -lrb- 95 fahrenheit -rrb- in some areas , raising the risk of new fires , and remain high until at least wednesday .
emergency workers were evacuating residents from a village near coimbra because of the the threat from the thick smoke and advancing flames , tsf reported . police said at least five roads in the center and north of the country were closed because of the flames and smoke . calls for joint fire-fighting force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on french radio , interior minister antonio costa said meanwhile that europe should combine its resources in fighting fires , notably by jointly building specialized water-bombing aircraft .
" it is essential to pool our resources because we have fires in portugal , but tomorrow there could be others in spain , in italy , in greece , " costa told french radio station europe 1 .
his comments echoed those of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who on sunday also called for the eu to set up a joint firefighting force .
ten firefighters have died so far this year battling blazes in portugal which have already destroyed 134,500 hectares -lrb- 332,000 acres -rrb- of land - more than in all of 2004 when just under 130,000 hectares burned . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heat wave fears rise as portugal burns as forest fires continue to rage throughout portugal , a deadly heat wave spreading across southern europe is causing concern in spain and france .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .
it has been really fun . "
world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .
" he is tough and will be able to move the church in a new direction , " said oliver boss , secretary to the archbishop of cologne .

she also defended the man slated to be her finance minister and his ambitious tax reform plans . smiling a lot more and sitting comfortably in the single seat across from host sabine christiansen , christian democratic candidate angela merkel put on the charm .
it was the same seat in which chancellor gerhard schröder put his talents as an accomplished campaigner on full display two weeks earlier , warmly joking with christiansen and the audience while still appearing statesmanlike .
on sunday night , merkel , who is four points behind schröder in popularity polls , was in the hot seat . luckily for the former east german physicist , germans are voting for parties , not personalities , in the planned sept .
18 elections .
and it 's on the strength of their party platform , and the widespread disappointment in schröder 's economic reforms , that the christian democratic union has built a comfortable lead over the chancellor 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : angela merkel , here with the show 's host , sabine christiansen merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has promised to bring down unemployment by making germany an attractive place for investors .
a key challenge , bringing down the deficit by cutting germany 's debt , will be the job of paul kirchhof , a former constitutional court judge whose ideas have reaped a lot of criticism from party members .
on sunday , merkel went out of her way to stand behind the man she 'll like appoint finance minister in the event of her victory . kirchhof a " visionary " kirchhof 's plans are " visionary , " merkel told christiansen .
she said she saw no major problem with his call for a 25 percent tax rate , which clashes with the cdu platform , saying that kirchhof 's job will be to " push us and spur us on . " the cdu plans a tax reform concept that sets rates between 12 and 39 percent .
that is " a very significant step towards his vision , " she added .
even as most of his party critics returned to toeing the line over the weekend , members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- took further jabs at kirchhof .
dirk niebel , general secretary of the cdu 's likely coalition partners , said his idea was not financially viable at the moment , as a lower rate would cut the government 's tax income . unjust and brutal critics from the spd went even further .
wolfgang thierse , the president of germany 's bundestag , called kirchhof 's plans " seductively simple , brutally unjust and not financially feasible . " kirchhof himself stuck to his guns .
in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel he said he planned to eliminate all 418 tax loopholes in an effort to simplify and improve the tax system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof " if you let one or the other loophole stay , people will ask , ' why this one and not the others ? " ' he said .
kirchhof said last week he wanted a tax system that would allow people to do their taxes in ten minutes .
in the long-term he 's advocating for a system that taxes both people and companies the same regardless of how they make their money . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax reformer tapped for finance post angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .

she also defended the man slated to be her finance minister and his ambitious tax reform plans . smiling a lot more and sitting comfortably in the single seat across from host sabine christiansen , christian democratic candidate angela merkel put on the charm .
it was the same seat in which chancellor gerhard schröder put his talents as an accomplished campaigner on full display two weeks earlier , warmly joking with christiansen and the audience while still appearing statesmanlike .
on sunday night , merkel , who is four points behind schröder in popularity polls , was in the hot seat . luckily for the former east german physicist , germans are voting for parties , not personalities , in the planned sept .
18 elections .
and it 's on the strength of their party platform , and the widespread disappointment in schröder 's economic reforms , that the christian democratic union has built a comfortable lead over the chancellor 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : angela merkel , here with the show 's host , sabine christiansen merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has promised to bring down unemployment by making germany an attractive place for investors .
a key challenge , bringing down the deficit by cutting germany 's debt , will be the job of paul kirchhof , a former constitutional court judge whose ideas have reaped a lot of criticism from party members .
on sunday , merkel went out of her way to stand behind the man she 'll like appoint finance minister in the event of her victory . kirchhof a " visionary " kirchhof 's plans are " visionary , " merkel told christiansen .
she said she saw no major problem with his call for a 25 percent tax rate , which clashes with the cdu platform , saying that kirchhof 's job will be to " push us and spur us on . " the cdu plans a tax reform concept that sets rates between 12 and 39 percent .
that is " a very significant step towards his vision , " she added .
even as most of his party critics returned to toeing the line over the weekend , members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- took further jabs at kirchhof .
dirk niebel , general secretary of the cdu 's likely coalition partners , said his idea was not financially viable at the moment , as a lower rate would cut the government 's tax income . unjust and brutal critics from the spd went even further .
wolfgang thierse , the president of germany 's bundestag , called kirchhof 's plans " seductively simple , brutally unjust and not financially feasible . " kirchhof himself stuck to his guns .
in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel he said he planned to eliminate all 418 tax loopholes in an effort to simplify and improve the tax system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof " if you let one or the other loophole stay , people will ask , ' why this one and not the others ? " ' he said .
kirchhof said last week he wanted a tax system that would allow people to do their taxes in ten minutes .
in the long-term he 's advocating for a system that taxes both people and companies the same regardless of how they make their money . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax reformer tapped for finance post angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .
it has been really fun . "
world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .
" he is tough and will be able to move the church in a new direction , " said oliver boss , secretary to the archbishop of cologne .

"
how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?
not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches . in the days before stylists fussed over her hair and clothing and before public relations advisors taught her how to smile more , angela merkel was no one 's idea of the perfect chancellor candidate . now , the woman from the eastern german fishing village of templin is a vision in colorful button-down suits , and her face tries its very best to exude a politician 's false warmth . all that 's missing is a little rock n ' roll - and who better to provide that than the granddaddies of the genre themselves ? recently , angela - or angie , as her campaign staff would like germans to think of her - has been leaving the stage following her stump speeches to the strains of the rolling stones ' eponymous song . the soulful wail of mick jagger over a mournful melody of piano and guitar is , apparently , supposed to let germans know that this woman feels their pain .
but did anyone in her coterie think to pay a little bit more to what mick and co. were singing ?
and did anyone ask the kings of rock n ' roll if a conservative chancellor candidate in germany could even use the hit from 1973 ?
the stones say no .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolling stones ' mick jagger sings at fenway park in boston on sunday , where the rolling stones opened their " a bigger bang " world tour .
" we did n't grant permission , " said a spokesman for the band over the weekend in great britain 's observer . " we are surprised that permission was not requested .
if it had been , we would have said no . " a merkel spokesman , on the other hand , said the campaign consulted with germany 's music distribution rights agency , which told them they did n't need permission .
the row wo n't likely end up in court , but the candidate 's campaign team wo n't win any points for packaging . merkel , for all her newfound charm and style , still could n't be less rock n ' roll , something the song 's lyrics weirdly seem to acknowledge .

the employees will be allowed to continue working in a joint venture with an external partner , the paper said . the chief of opel 's workers ' union , klaus franz , said that the plan was contrary to the contract agreed on in march , but gm disagreed .
general motors ' europe speaker , rüdiger assion , said that outsourcing plans had been part of the contract from the beginning , and that it was planned all along to move the 100 bochum jobs to an external contractor .
the opel workers ' union nonetheless applied for a provisional order at a court in bochum , which resulted in the planned outsourcing being postponed until november 30th .
until then , the opel workers ' union will negotiate with opel 's management . dw-world.de gm reveals cuts at opel general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 umts : the next big thing is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surf on the beach , with your mobile phone a few years ago , many were preparing for the eventual death of umts .
but thanks to an increasingly wireless world , the " next big thing " in mobile phones is making a comeback . umts - the four letters that stand for universal mobile telecommunications system once sent excited chills through the mobile phone industry , promising fantastic technological leaps and big profits .
nowadays , it 's more likely to be the source of exasperated sighs , as one of the worst investments in the industry 's history . the once hyped umts standard -lrb- also called g3 -rrb- is still waiting for its big break .
an estimated 25 million mobile phones are equipped with the technology , but that number makes up only 1 percent of all phones worldwide . german experts say there are an estimated 500,000 umts clients in germany , including a few hundred thousand clients who surf the internet with their laptop using mobile cards . but only 10 percent of the umts network 's capacity in germany is being used , proof that five years after the country 's biggest telecoms companies handed the government 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.1 billion -rrb- for the right to use the network , the big break has been slow in coming . the next big thing tanks five years ago , the industry could n't get enough umts , widely tipping it to be the " next big thing . "
the massive amounts of data that could travel from mobile to mobile at high speeds promised the advent of television shows watched in the palm of a hand , and internet surfing anywhere on earth . but things have progressed a lot more slowly .
the stock market crash meant telecom companies soon ran out of the cash necessary to build umts networks .
mobile phone manufacturers took longer than expected in working out the technology 's bugs .
the first phones were heavy and clunky and did n't work properly . then came the arrival of a competitor nobody had counted on .
wireless lan networks also promised wireless surfing , for far less money .
at industry events like 2003 's technology trade fair cebit in hanover , germany , some wondered whether umts was on its way out . early-adaptors good for everyone telecom companies soon learned to welcome the competition .

apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .

nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?
what was he doing in sheerness , and how did he get there ?

according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .
in fact , all he ever did was tap one key over and over again . " a nurse went into his room last friday and said ' are you going to speak to us today ? '

" he was obviously in a distressed state and did n't talk to police .
then it just went from there . " just a hoax allegedly , he also told hospital staff that he was a german who 'd travelled to britain by eurostar .

he also revealed he 'd recently lost a job in paris , was gay , and had two sisters and a father who owned a farm . crucially , he also said that he 'd worked with mentally ill patients .
the revelation clears up at least one mystery - how a suicidal german managed to fool so many people for so long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 when the pope and pilgrims have gone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " up the stairs to the jet , holiness " all but a fraction of the one million visitors have now left cologne after world youth day - an accomplishment that went over with only a few hitches . on sunday , one million visitors were trying to leave the marienfeld , a large meadow and formerly an open pit mine , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- west of cologne after having celebrated mass with the pope .
for the organizers , it was a logistical nightmare that guaranteed complications .
a whole stretch of a major autobahn near the western german city was converted into a parking lot and one-way street so that busses could shuttle the young spiritual visitors away from the marienfeld with as little difficulty as possible for them and the expected return of vacationers in the state of north-rhine westphalia , where school starts again this week .
the german railway added an extra 400 trains to get the throngs back to cologne from the makeshift place of worship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict celebrates sunday mass , the climax of the world youth day in cologne dozens of journalists found out personally just what it means to be a pilgrim when they were sent from one exit to the next to find where the shuttle busses were departing .
but at the end of the day , security officials said that the million teens and early 20-year-olds were cooperative .
" all but 6,000 have left cologne -lrb- as of monday morning -rrb- , " was the word from the police .
security tight but seldom needed over the course of pope benedict 's four-day visit to germany , police reported that there were eight security breaches in the air , including a hot-air balloon that soared on saturday night over the marienfeld where wyd held its vigil .
on sunday , the pope-mobile took another route to the marienfeld due to the discovery of what appeared to be a bomb , but later turned out to be a fake .

she also defended the man slated to be her finance minister and his ambitious tax reform plans . smiling a lot more and sitting comfortably in the single seat across from host sabine christiansen , christian democratic candidate angela merkel put on the charm .
it was the same seat in which chancellor gerhard schröder put his talents as an accomplished campaigner on full display two weeks earlier , warmly joking with christiansen and the audience while still appearing statesmanlike .
on sunday night , merkel , who is four points behind schröder in popularity polls , was in the hot seat . luckily for the former east german physicist , germans are voting for parties , not personalities , in the planned sept .

even as most of his party critics returned to toeing the line over the weekend , members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- took further jabs at kirchhof .
dirk niebel , general secretary of the cdu 's likely coalition partners , said his idea was not financially viable at the moment , as a lower rate would cut the government 's tax income . unjust and brutal critics from the spd went even further .
wolfgang thierse , the president of germany 's bundestag , called kirchhof 's plans " seductively simple , brutally unjust and not financially feasible . " kirchhof himself stuck to his guns .
in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel he said he planned to eliminate all 418 tax loopholes in an effort to simplify and improve the tax system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof " if you let one or the other loophole stay , people will ask , ' why this one and not the others ? " ' he said .
kirchhof said last week he wanted a tax system that would allow people to do their taxes in ten minutes .

often it all goes to plan for the big names but sometimes the script gets rewritten . fc cologne may be fifth in the bundesliga table but they crashed out of the german cup at the first hurdle with second division kickers offenbach triumphing 3-1 on saturday . cologne took a 29th minute lead through markus feulner but the sending-off of their zambian midfielder andrew sinkala after 56 minutes changed the complexion of the match . " we had the game under control for an hour and then came the sending off , " said cologne manager uwe rapolder .
" it is a shame to go out and it has shown us that there is work still to do . " qualid mokhtari leveled for offenbach in the 65th minute and suat turker then put the hosts in front seven minutes later .
former german international christian rahn scored an own goal four minutes from time to seal 10-man cologne 's misery . on the following monday dortmund were beaten 2-1 by the second division side eintracht braunschweig in a match watched by a passionate home crowd of 22,200 . jan koller gave bvb the lead on 28 minutes , but a brilliant diving header by jürgen rische on 41 and a dramatic 84th-minute strike from captain daniel graf took the underdogs into the second round and dumped the woeful big league visitors out of the cup . the other bundesliga teams in action over the weekend had little trouble in securing passage to the second round and big guns such as bayer leverkusen , werder bremen and sv hamburg were in fine form . most bundesliga sides progress at a stroll leverkusen crushed rot-weiss erfurt amateure 8-0 with serbia and montenegro star danko lazovic scoring a hat-trick inside ten minutes midway through the second half . " it was a great day for me , " lazovic said .
" i am just glad to have this chance at a great club like leverkusen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen , winners in 2004 , ran out 3-1 victors over wattenscheid while hamburg hammered stuttgart kickers 5-1 . hamburg crashed out 4-2 to sc paderborn in the first round of last season 's competition although it was later revealed that disgraced referee robert hoyer had manipulated the tie for financial gain . last season 's quarter-finalists paderborn had no time for giant killing this time around as they fell 2-0 to vfl wolfsburg . schalke 04 were runners-up to bayern munich in last season 's final and they justified their favorite tag with a 3-0 thrashing of unknowns bremerhaven . danish international soren larsen continues to shine since arriving in the close season scoring twice to help the visitors ease through . it was far from easy for bundesliga outfit hertha berlin who needed extra-time to defeat koblenz 3-2 . hertha were 2-1 down at one stage but brazilian marcelinho equalized and niko kovac scored the winner to save the club 's blushes . stuttgart let out of jail with extra-time victory vfb stuttgart had a scare against amateur club tsg hoffenheim on sunday .
the home side scraped through to the second round of the german cup with a 4-3 extra-time win .
the early season crisis , in which stuttgart have taken just a point from their opening two bundesliga matches , looked to be going from bad to worse when they fell 2-1 behind to the regional third division side at the end of the first half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new signing jon dahl tomasson equalized in the 54th minute to send the match into extra-time , however , and goals from croatia 's mario carevic and brazilian forward cacau sent them clear . hoffenheim defender matthias orum pulled one back late in the game but stuttgart held on for a much needed victory . cup holders bayern munich made light work of msv 1919 neuruppin in berlin on sunday , winning 4-0 in their first game of their defense . two goals from golden oldie mehmet scholl sealed the win after valerien ismael had opened the scoring with his first goal for bayern since his pre-season move from werder bremen .
youngster andreas ottl also got his first senior goal to ease the champions ' passage to the next round . while not such a giant force in their own league , hanover 96 are positively enormous compared to cologne amateurs who play in the regional third division .
the miss-matched tie on friday evening offered few surprises with the bundesliga outfit putting four past the youth team without reply . vahid hashemian , the iranian international signed by hanover from bayern munich , opened the scoring in the sixth minute .
hanover finished the game at a stroll after cologne 's tobias nickenig was sent off midway through the first half and completed the rout with goals from thomas brdaric , chavdar yankov and jiri stajner . the other top league side in action on friday was recently promoted eintracht frankfurt who won in less comfortable circumstances against rot-weiss oberhausen , holding on to a 2-1 victory for their first win of the season . new signings benjamin huggel and ioannis amanatidis put frankfurt 2-0 up before dalibor gataric 's reply 13 minutes from time set up a nervous finale . cottbus keeper the saviour and hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pick of the other six matches was the cliff-hanger between second division energie cottbus and amateurs rot-weiss essen which finished in favor of the professionals from the east after a dramatic penalty shoot-out which cottbus won 5-4 . the hero of the night was energie 's bosnian goalkeeper tomislav piplica -lrb- photo , right -rrb- who saved from lennart lynge larsen at 4-4 in the shootout before scoring the winner himself . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big names hoping to avoid cup slip-ups while there is no league action this weekend , bundesliga sides are still facing challenges in the first round of the dfb cup which traditionally throws davids and goliaths together .

without missing a beat , she began dancing to turkish music with local residents and party supporters .
crowding around them and adding to the mayhem , a ring of journalists from many of germany 's major media outlets scrambled to capture the action . roth then led the throngs into a turkish diner shop , where she shaved meat from the giant spit while cameras hummed and whirred .
it was a textbook media opportunity . " the opposition likes to campaign at the cost of minorities , " roth told her cheering supporters .
" that really kills the mood in this country . " a serious reason behind the fun the greens have been going out of their way to make a scene in berlin this august to convey a simple message : we are a party that can have fun , and we are a party that still matters for the parliamentary election next month . in the past weeks , interested citizens have been invited by the party 's leadership to explore berlin 's neighborhoods on foot , on skates , and on the water - in a solar-powered boat , of course .
on these outings , participants receive an education in the green way of life and are meant to experience first hand the " chillness " of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer 's not just " peddling " green ideas the interested could play blitz chess with party co-chair reinhard bütikofer , tour the city 's bars with the green youth or discuss the country 's new prostitution law in a berlin brothel . despite the " fun factor " involved in the events , the party has a serious reason for offering them .
given the current party constellations and the rise of the newly founded left party , the greens need to do everything they can to make themselves apparent , said wolfgang donsbach , a political communications professor at dresden 's technical university . somewhat off-beat campaign events , such as the kreuzberg tour , could help the party if they reach a nationwide audience , he added .
with a new edition of the current governing coalition with the social democrats unlikely and having been overshadowed by the upstart left party as the " hot new thing , " greens must raise their profile somehow or they will run the risk of irrelevancy . repeating previous mistakes ? it 's an approach that 's been -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- tried before .
the green party 's idiosyncratic line-up of publicity events has been turning heads in berlin and perhaps effecting an image change .
but the campaign planners will have to be careful that too much mirth can damage the perception of the greens as a party fit to govern germany . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung recently referred to the " fun campaign of the eco-party , " drawing a parallel to similar attempts by the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- to woo voters during the 2002 election . the fdp garnered the moniker of " fun party " mostly through the antics of party chief guido westerwelle , who was hoping to create a new image with the ambitious goal of reaching 18 percent of the vote .
but westerwelle 's shenanigans failed to grab media attention and linked the fdp with levity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun times did n't last long for the free democrats the result at the polls was certainly not a laughing matter .
despite the " guidomobile " , the flashy yellow motor home westerwelle used to tour germany under the motto " politics can also be fun " ; despite the ' 18 % ' garishly inscribed on his shoe soles ; despite his appearance on the voyeuristic tv show big brother ; or rather , as many say , because of these silly actions , the fdp reached a disappointing 7.4 percent of the vote , putting a jarring end to the party 's summer of fun . optimism backed by plans this summer , the mood for the premature bundestag election campaign is visibly more solemn .
when german voters go to the polls on sept .
18 , the " fun factor " probably is n't high on their lists : the malaise surrounding record unemployment and sluggish growth preclude any campaign strategies with non-serious content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jürgen trittin checks out a hippopotamus at berlin 's zoo karl rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisberg-essen in western germany , said that the times are too dire for a " fun party . " but the greens do n't seem to follow in the fdp 's footsteps , korte added . " they do n't want to be the fun party , but perhaps lighten their image somewhat , " korte said .
" they want to avoid the stigma that ' if it 's green , then it must taste bad . '
they want to develop a profile of wellness . " exuding an optimistic , positive attitude is crucial for the success of a party , donsbach said . the perception of a " good mood " is essential , " but it has to be supported by good policies , " he said .
" only with fun , only with ballyhoo , it wo n't work .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "

" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "

world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .

the opel workers ' union nonetheless applied for a provisional order at a court in bochum , which resulted in the planned outsourcing being postponed until november 30th .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 22.08.2005 germany 's greens bank on fun in election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having a laugh : green party co-chairs roth -lrb- left -rrb- and bütikofer in a struggle for survival as germany 's third-largest party , greens leaders have taken an unusual approach to campaigning by inviting people to debates in brothels and offering sightseeing tours of turkish neighborhoods . on a recent balmy summer afternoon in kreuzberg , berlin 's bustling turkish neighborhood , an abundance of green t-shirts and balloons near a fruit stand hinted that something unusual was about to happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth showing off condoms that read " prevent guido " -lrb- fdp leader guido westerwelle -rrb- and " prevent merkel " -lrb- cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel -rrb- as out of nowhere , claudia roth , the green party 's national co-chair , materialized in the midst of the turmoil .
without missing a beat , she began dancing to turkish music with local residents and party supporters .
crowding around them and adding to the mayhem , a ring of journalists from many of germany 's major media outlets scrambled to capture the action . roth then led the throngs into a turkish diner shop , where she shaved meat from the giant spit while cameras hummed and whirred .
it was a textbook media opportunity . " the opposition likes to campaign at the cost of minorities , " roth told her cheering supporters .
" that really kills the mood in this country . " a serious reason behind the fun the greens have been going out of their way to make a scene in berlin this august to convey a simple message : we are a party that can have fun , and we are a party that still matters for the parliamentary election next month . in the past weeks , interested citizens have been invited by the party 's leadership to explore berlin 's neighborhoods on foot , on skates , and on the water - in a solar-powered boat , of course .
on these outings , participants receive an education in the green way of life and are meant to experience first hand the " chillness " of the party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer 's not just " peddling " green ideas the interested could play blitz chess with party co-chair reinhard bütikofer , tour the city 's bars with the green youth or discuss the country 's new prostitution law in a berlin brothel . despite the " fun factor " involved in the events , the party has a serious reason for offering them .
given the current party constellations and the rise of the newly founded left party , the greens need to do everything they can to make themselves apparent , said wolfgang donsbach , a political communications professor at dresden 's technical university . somewhat off-beat campaign events , such as the kreuzberg tour , could help the party if they reach a nationwide audience , he added .
with a new edition of the current governing coalition with the social democrats unlikely and having been overshadowed by the upstart left party as the " hot new thing , " greens must raise their profile somehow or they will run the risk of irrelevancy . repeating previous mistakes ? it 's an approach that 's been -lrb- unsuccessfully -rrb- tried before .
the green party 's idiosyncratic line-up of publicity events has been turning heads in berlin and perhaps effecting an image change .
but the campaign planners will have to be careful that too much mirth can damage the perception of the greens as a party fit to govern germany . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung recently referred to the " fun campaign of the eco-party , " drawing a parallel to similar attempts by the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- to woo voters during the 2002 election . the fdp garnered the moniker of " fun party " mostly through the antics of party chief guido westerwelle , who was hoping to create a new image with the ambitious goal of reaching 18 percent of the vote .
but westerwelle 's shenanigans failed to grab media attention and linked the fdp with levity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fun times did n't last long for the free democrats the result at the polls was certainly not a laughing matter .
despite the " guidomobile " , the flashy yellow motor home westerwelle used to tour germany under the motto " politics can also be fun " ; despite the ' 18 % ' garishly inscribed on his shoe soles ; despite his appearance on the voyeuristic tv show big brother ; or rather , as many say , because of these silly actions , the fdp reached a disappointing 7.4 percent of the vote , putting a jarring end to the party 's summer of fun . optimism backed by plans this summer , the mood for the premature bundestag election campaign is visibly more solemn .
when german voters go to the polls on sept .
18 , the " fun factor " probably is n't high on their lists : the malaise surrounding record unemployment and sluggish growth preclude any campaign strategies with non-serious content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jürgen trittin checks out a hippopotamus at berlin 's zoo karl rudolf korte , a political scientist at the university of duisberg-essen in western germany , said that the times are too dire for a " fun party . " but the greens do n't seem to follow in the fdp 's footsteps , korte added . " they do n't want to be the fun party , but perhaps lighten their image somewhat , " korte said .
" they want to avoid the stigma that ' if it 's green , then it must taste bad . '
they want to develop a profile of wellness . " exuding an optimistic , positive attitude is crucial for the success of a party , donsbach said . the perception of a " good mood " is essential , " but it has to be supported by good policies , " he said .

a water-dropping aircraft from italy was due to join the efforts later against wildfires which circled coimbra , portugal 's third-largest city , and continued to threaten some built-up areas .
but three helicopters from germany , along with 25 anti-fire specialists , would likely not be deployed until tuesday because they will arrive too close to sundown , the agency said .
two fire-fighting helicopters sent from the netherlands were also due to arrive tuesday , dutch officials said . in total over 2,600 firefighters backed by 31 water-dropping aircraft and nearly 800 vehicles were involved in the firefighting operation in portugal , which is facing its worst drought since 1945 . bildunterschrift : european solidarity the president of the european commission , jose barroso , who on sunday visited areas affected by fires in his native portugal where he is on holiday , praised the aid offered by eu nations to portugal .
" we are all very impressed by the size of this problem .
but it is with satisfaction that we watch european solidarity once more at work , " he told reporters in northern portugal , in comments broadcast on lisbon-based tsf radio .
portugal appealed for help from its fellow european union member states on saturday after the number of blazes raging out of control in the country rose above 50 , the highest single day tally so far this year .
the fast-moving wildfires had already charred at least 12 homes on the outskirts of coimbra , located some 200 kilometers of lisbon , and forced the evacuation overnight of some 60 people , local officials said .
with a change in wind direction , coimbra itself was no longer threatened by the flames , but firefighters were on guard against the possibility of flare-ups in the charred areas near the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was a terrible night for the people of the city and for everyone involved in fighting the fire , " the governor of the district of coimbra , henrique fernandes , told state television rtp .
forecasters meanwhile predicted temperatures would soar above a scorching 35 degrees celsius -lrb- 95 fahrenheit -rrb- in some areas , raising the risk of new fires , and remain high until at least wednesday .
emergency workers were evacuating residents from a village near coimbra because of the the threat from the thick smoke and advancing flames , tsf reported . police said at least five roads in the center and north of the country were closed because of the flames and smoke . calls for joint fire-fighting force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on french radio , interior minister antonio costa said meanwhile that europe should combine its resources in fighting fires , notably by jointly building specialized water-bombing aircraft .
" it is essential to pool our resources because we have fires in portugal , but tomorrow there could be others in spain , in italy , in greece , " costa told french radio station europe 1 .
his comments echoed those of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who on sunday also called for the eu to set up a joint firefighting force .
ten firefighters have died so far this year battling blazes in portugal which have already destroyed 134,500 hectares -lrb- 332,000 acres -rrb- of land - more than in all of 2004 when just under 130,000 hectares burned . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heat wave fears rise as portugal burns as forest fires continue to rage throughout portugal , a deadly heat wave spreading across southern europe is causing concern in spain and france .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .

world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .
" he is tough and will be able to move the church in a new direction , " said oliver boss , secretary to the archbishop of cologne .

she also defended the man slated to be her finance minister and his ambitious tax reform plans . smiling a lot more and sitting comfortably in the single seat across from host sabine christiansen , christian democratic candidate angela merkel put on the charm .
it was the same seat in which chancellor gerhard schröder put his talents as an accomplished campaigner on full display two weeks earlier , warmly joking with christiansen and the audience while still appearing statesmanlike .
on sunday night , merkel , who is four points behind schröder in popularity polls , was in the hot seat . luckily for the former east german physicist , germans are voting for parties , not personalities , in the planned sept .
18 elections .
and it 's on the strength of their party platform , and the widespread disappointment in schröder 's economic reforms , that the christian democratic union has built a comfortable lead over the chancellor 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : angela merkel , here with the show 's host , sabine christiansen merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has promised to bring down unemployment by making germany an attractive place for investors .
a key challenge , bringing down the deficit by cutting germany 's debt , will be the job of paul kirchhof , a former constitutional court judge whose ideas have reaped a lot of criticism from party members .
on sunday , merkel went out of her way to stand behind the man she 'll like appoint finance minister in the event of her victory . kirchhof a " visionary " kirchhof 's plans are " visionary , " merkel told christiansen .
she said she saw no major problem with his call for a 25 percent tax rate , which clashes with the cdu platform , saying that kirchhof 's job will be to " push us and spur us on . " the cdu plans a tax reform concept that sets rates between 12 and 39 percent .
that is " a very significant step towards his vision , " she added .
even as most of his party critics returned to toeing the line over the weekend , members of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- took further jabs at kirchhof .
dirk niebel , general secretary of the cdu 's likely coalition partners , said his idea was not financially viable at the moment , as a lower rate would cut the government 's tax income . unjust and brutal critics from the spd went even further .
wolfgang thierse , the president of germany 's bundestag , called kirchhof 's plans " seductively simple , brutally unjust and not financially feasible . " kirchhof himself stuck to his guns .
in an interview with newsmagazine der spiegel he said he planned to eliminate all 418 tax loopholes in an effort to simplify and improve the tax system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof " if you let one or the other loophole stay , people will ask , ' why this one and not the others ? " ' he said .
kirchhof said last week he wanted a tax system that would allow people to do their taxes in ten minutes .
in the long-term he 's advocating for a system that taxes both people and companies the same regardless of how they make their money . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax reformer tapped for finance post angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "

but thanks to an increasingly wireless world , the " next big thing " in mobile phones is making a comeback . umts - the four letters that stand for universal mobile telecommunications system once sent excited chills through the mobile phone industry , promising fantastic technological leaps and big profits .
nowadays , it 's more likely to be the source of exasperated sighs , as one of the worst investments in the industry 's history . the once hyped umts standard -lrb- also called g3 -rrb- is still waiting for its big break .
an estimated 25 million mobile phones are equipped with the technology , but that number makes up only 1 percent of all phones worldwide . german experts say there are an estimated 500,000 umts clients in germany , including a few hundred thousand clients who surf the internet with their laptop using mobile cards . but only 10 percent of the umts network 's capacity in germany is being used , proof that five years after the country 's biggest telecoms companies handed the government 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.1 billion -rrb- for the right to use the network , the big break has been slow in coming . the next big thing tanks five years ago , the industry could n't get enough umts , widely tipping it to be the " next big thing . "
the massive amounts of data that could travel from mobile to mobile at high speeds promised the advent of television shows watched in the palm of a hand , and internet surfing anywhere on earth . but things have progressed a lot more slowly .
the stock market crash meant telecom companies soon ran out of the cash necessary to build umts networks .
mobile phone manufacturers took longer than expected in working out the technology 's bugs .
the first phones were heavy and clunky and did n't work properly . then came the arrival of a competitor nobody had counted on .
wireless lan networks also promised wireless surfing , for far less money .
at industry events like 2003 's technology trade fair cebit in hanover , germany , some wondered whether umts was on its way out . early-adaptors good for everyone telecom companies soon learned to welcome the competition .
thanks to w-lan technology more and more people are getting used to the concept of wireless surfing , made possible by surfing " hot spots " spread across cities all across the world .
whether it 's dw-world.de , bbc or cnn , all major web portals are now offering the possibility to surf their content with a mobile phone while on the road . bildunterschrift : dw-world readers get a chance to surf on their mobiles the news out of japan that young people are getting more and more used to watching short video clips on their mobiles is as encouraging .
though the price may still be prohibitive , the rates are sinking and it will only be a matter of time for mobile surfing is included in a flat rate offered phone clients when they sign their contracts . vodafone , the world market leader , is certainly optimistic , hoping for close to 10 million umts clients by early 2006 .
whether that will be enough to compensate for the millions spent five years ago is still up in the air .
but , in the end , vodafone , t-mobile and others will probably care less what sort of technology will be used : mobile surfing will make them lot 's of money in the coming years . holger hank -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world 's biggest it fair comes to town cebit , the trade fair that delivers the latest in technological innovation to an increasingly hungry public , opens this week in hanover .
after a number of lean years , exhibitors are gradually returning in numbers .
-lrb- march 7 , 2005 -rrb- third generation mobile phones arrive in germany it 's taken four long years , and many are wondering whether it was worth waiting for : the first handsets for the new third-generation mobile phone system are hitting the market in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 22.08.2005 mixed fortunes for big guns in dfb cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski & co. do n't have to worry about the distractions of the cup now the minnows often relish their chances to take a nip out of the bigger fish but the natural order of things prevailed , for the most part , in the first round of the german cup last week . traditionally the first round of the german cup is one where the smaller clubs get to pit their talents against their better and more financially blessed relatives from the bundesliga .
often it all goes to plan for the big names but sometimes the script gets rewritten . fc cologne may be fifth in the bundesliga table but they crashed out of the german cup at the first hurdle with second division kickers offenbach triumphing 3-1 on saturday . cologne took a 29th minute lead through markus feulner but the sending-off of their zambian midfielder andrew sinkala after 56 minutes changed the complexion of the match . " we had the game under control for an hour and then came the sending off , " said cologne manager uwe rapolder .
" it is a shame to go out and it has shown us that there is work still to do . " qualid mokhtari leveled for offenbach in the 65th minute and suat turker then put the hosts in front seven minutes later .
former german international christian rahn scored an own goal four minutes from time to seal 10-man cologne 's misery . on the following monday dortmund were beaten 2-1 by the second division side eintracht braunschweig in a match watched by a passionate home crowd of 22,200 . jan koller gave bvb the lead on 28 minutes , but a brilliant diving header by jürgen rische on 41 and a dramatic 84th-minute strike from captain daniel graf took the underdogs into the second round and dumped the woeful big league visitors out of the cup . the other bundesliga teams in action over the weekend had little trouble in securing passage to the second round and big guns such as bayer leverkusen , werder bremen and sv hamburg were in fine form . most bundesliga sides progress at a stroll leverkusen crushed rot-weiss erfurt amateure 8-0 with serbia and montenegro star danko lazovic scoring a hat-trick inside ten minutes midway through the second half . " it was a great day for me , " lazovic said .
" i am just glad to have this chance at a great club like leverkusen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen , winners in 2004 , ran out 3-1 victors over wattenscheid while hamburg hammered stuttgart kickers 5-1 . hamburg crashed out 4-2 to sc paderborn in the first round of last season 's competition although it was later revealed that disgraced referee robert hoyer had manipulated the tie for financial gain . last season 's quarter-finalists paderborn had no time for giant killing this time around as they fell 2-0 to vfl wolfsburg . schalke 04 were runners-up to bayern munich in last season 's final and they justified their favorite tag with a 3-0 thrashing of unknowns bremerhaven . danish international soren larsen continues to shine since arriving in the close season scoring twice to help the visitors ease through . it was far from easy for bundesliga outfit hertha berlin who needed extra-time to defeat koblenz 3-2 . hertha were 2-1 down at one stage but brazilian marcelinho equalized and niko kovac scored the winner to save the club 's blushes . stuttgart let out of jail with extra-time victory vfb stuttgart had a scare against amateur club tsg hoffenheim on sunday .
the home side scraped through to the second round of the german cup with a 4-3 extra-time win .
the early season crisis , in which stuttgart have taken just a point from their opening two bundesliga matches , looked to be going from bad to worse when they fell 2-1 behind to the regional third division side at the end of the first half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new signing jon dahl tomasson equalized in the 54th minute to send the match into extra-time , however , and goals from croatia 's mario carevic and brazilian forward cacau sent them clear . hoffenheim defender matthias orum pulled one back late in the game but stuttgart held on for a much needed victory . cup holders bayern munich made light work of msv 1919 neuruppin in berlin on sunday , winning 4-0 in their first game of their defense . two goals from golden oldie mehmet scholl sealed the win after valerien ismael had opened the scoring with his first goal for bayern since his pre-season move from werder bremen .
youngster andreas ottl also got his first senior goal to ease the champions ' passage to the next round . while not such a giant force in their own league , hanover 96 are positively enormous compared to cologne amateurs who play in the regional third division .
the miss-matched tie on friday evening offered few surprises with the bundesliga outfit putting four past the youth team without reply . vahid hashemian , the iranian international signed by hanover from bayern munich , opened the scoring in the sixth minute .
hanover finished the game at a stroll after cologne 's tobias nickenig was sent off midway through the first half and completed the rout with goals from thomas brdaric , chavdar yankov and jiri stajner . the other top league side in action on friday was recently promoted eintracht frankfurt who won in less comfortable circumstances against rot-weiss oberhausen , holding on to a 2-1 victory for their first win of the season . new signings benjamin huggel and ioannis amanatidis put frankfurt 2-0 up before dalibor gataric 's reply 13 minutes from time set up a nervous finale . cottbus keeper the saviour and hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pick of the other six matches was the cliff-hanger between second division energie cottbus and amateurs rot-weiss essen which finished in favor of the professionals from the east after a dramatic penalty shoot-out which cottbus won 5-4 . the hero of the night was energie 's bosnian goalkeeper tomislav piplica -lrb- photo , right -rrb- who saved from lennart lynge larsen at 4-4 in the shootout before scoring the winner himself . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big names hoping to avoid cup slip-ups while there is no league action this weekend , bundesliga sides are still facing challenges in the first round of the dfb cup which traditionally throws davids and goliaths together .

but thanks to an increasingly wireless world , the " next big thing " in mobile phones is making a comeback . umts - the four letters that stand for universal mobile telecommunications system once sent excited chills through the mobile phone industry , promising fantastic technological leaps and big profits .
nowadays , it 's more likely to be the source of exasperated sighs , as one of the worst investments in the industry 's history . the once hyped umts standard -lrb- also called g3 -rrb- is still waiting for its big break .
an estimated 25 million mobile phones are equipped with the technology , but that number makes up only 1 percent of all phones worldwide . german experts say there are an estimated 500,000 umts clients in germany , including a few hundred thousand clients who surf the internet with their laptop using mobile cards . but only 10 percent of the umts network 's capacity in germany is being used , proof that five years after the country 's biggest telecoms companies handed the government 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.1 billion -rrb- for the right to use the network , the big break has been slow in coming . the next big thing tanks five years ago , the industry could n't get enough umts , widely tipping it to be the " next big thing . "
the massive amounts of data that could travel from mobile to mobile at high speeds promised the advent of television shows watched in the palm of a hand , and internet surfing anywhere on earth . but things have progressed a lot more slowly .
the stock market crash meant telecom companies soon ran out of the cash necessary to build umts networks .
mobile phone manufacturers took longer than expected in working out the technology 's bugs .
the first phones were heavy and clunky and did n't work properly . then came the arrival of a competitor nobody had counted on .
wireless lan networks also promised wireless surfing , for far less money .
at industry events like 2003 's technology trade fair cebit in hanover , germany , some wondered whether umts was on its way out . early-adaptors good for everyone telecom companies soon learned to welcome the competition .
thanks to w-lan technology more and more people are getting used to the concept of wireless surfing , made possible by surfing " hot spots " spread across cities all across the world .
whether it 's dw-world.de , bbc or cnn , all major web portals are now offering the possibility to surf their content with a mobile phone while on the road . bildunterschrift : dw-world readers get a chance to surf on their mobiles the news out of japan that young people are getting more and more used to watching short video clips on their mobiles is as encouraging .
though the price may still be prohibitive , the rates are sinking and it will only be a matter of time for mobile surfing is included in a flat rate offered phone clients when they sign their contracts . vodafone , the world market leader , is certainly optimistic , hoping for close to 10 million umts clients by early 2006 .
whether that will be enough to compensate for the millions spent five years ago is still up in the air .
but , in the end , vodafone , t-mobile and others will probably care less what sort of technology will be used : mobile surfing will make them lot 's of money in the coming years . holger hank -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world 's biggest it fair comes to town cebit , the trade fair that delivers the latest in technological innovation to an increasingly hungry public , opens this week in hanover .

a water-dropping aircraft from italy was due to join the efforts later against wildfires which circled coimbra , portugal 's third-largest city , and continued to threaten some built-up areas .
but three helicopters from germany , along with 25 anti-fire specialists , would likely not be deployed until tuesday because they will arrive too close to sundown , the agency said .
two fire-fighting helicopters sent from the netherlands were also due to arrive tuesday , dutch officials said . in total over 2,600 firefighters backed by 31 water-dropping aircraft and nearly 800 vehicles were involved in the firefighting operation in portugal , which is facing its worst drought since 1945 . bildunterschrift : european solidarity the president of the european commission , jose barroso , who on sunday visited areas affected by fires in his native portugal where he is on holiday , praised the aid offered by eu nations to portugal .
" we are all very impressed by the size of this problem .
but it is with satisfaction that we watch european solidarity once more at work , " he told reporters in northern portugal , in comments broadcast on lisbon-based tsf radio .
portugal appealed for help from its fellow european union member states on saturday after the number of blazes raging out of control in the country rose above 50 , the highest single day tally so far this year .
the fast-moving wildfires had already charred at least 12 homes on the outskirts of coimbra , located some 200 kilometers of lisbon , and forced the evacuation overnight of some 60 people , local officials said .
with a change in wind direction , coimbra itself was no longer threatened by the flames , but firefighters were on guard against the possibility of flare-ups in the charred areas near the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it was a terrible night for the people of the city and for everyone involved in fighting the fire , " the governor of the district of coimbra , henrique fernandes , told state television rtp .
forecasters meanwhile predicted temperatures would soar above a scorching 35 degrees celsius -lrb- 95 fahrenheit -rrb- in some areas , raising the risk of new fires , and remain high until at least wednesday .
emergency workers were evacuating residents from a village near coimbra because of the the threat from the thick smoke and advancing flames , tsf reported . police said at least five roads in the center and north of the country were closed because of the flames and smoke . calls for joint fire-fighting force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on french radio , interior minister antonio costa said meanwhile that europe should combine its resources in fighting fires , notably by jointly building specialized water-bombing aircraft .
" it is essential to pool our resources because we have fires in portugal , but tomorrow there could be others in spain , in italy , in greece , " costa told french radio station europe 1 .
his comments echoed those of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who on sunday also called for the eu to set up a joint firefighting force .
ten firefighters have died so far this year battling blazes in portugal which have already destroyed 134,500 hectares -lrb- 332,000 acres -rrb- of land - more than in all of 2004 when just under 130,000 hectares burned . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heat wave fears rise as portugal burns as forest fires continue to rage throughout portugal , a deadly heat wave spreading across southern europe is causing concern in spain and france .

a water-dropping aircraft from italy was due to join the efforts later against wildfires which circled coimbra , portugal 's third-largest city , and continued to threaten some built-up areas .
but three helicopters from germany , along with 25 anti-fire specialists , would likely not be deployed until tuesday because they will arrive too close to sundown , the agency said .
two fire-fighting helicopters sent from the netherlands were also due to arrive tuesday , dutch officials said . in total over 2,600 firefighters backed by 31 water-dropping aircraft and nearly 800 vehicles were involved in the firefighting operation in portugal , which is facing its worst drought since 1945 . bildunterschrift : european solidarity the president of the european commission , jose barroso , who on sunday visited areas affected by fires in his native portugal where he is on holiday , praised the aid offered by eu nations to portugal .
" we are all very impressed by the size of this problem .
but it is with satisfaction that we watch european solidarity once more at work , " he told reporters in northern portugal , in comments broadcast on lisbon-based tsf radio .
portugal appealed for help from its fellow european union member states on saturday after the number of blazes raging out of control in the country rose above 50 , the highest single day tally so far this year .
the fast-moving wildfires had already charred at least 12 homes on the outskirts of coimbra , located some 200 kilometers of lisbon , and forced the evacuation overnight of some 60 people , local officials said .
with a change in wind direction , coimbra itself was no longer threatened by the flames , but firefighters were on guard against the possibility of flare-ups in the charred areas near the city .

emergency workers were evacuating residents from a village near coimbra because of the the threat from the thick smoke and advancing flames , tsf reported . police said at least five roads in the center and north of the country were closed because of the flames and smoke . calls for joint fire-fighting force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking on french radio , interior minister antonio costa said meanwhile that europe should combine its resources in fighting fires , notably by jointly building specialized water-bombing aircraft .
" it is essential to pool our resources because we have fires in portugal , but tomorrow there could be others in spain , in italy , in greece , " costa told french radio station europe 1 .
his comments echoed those of french interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who on sunday also called for the eu to set up a joint firefighting force .
ten firefighters have died so far this year battling blazes in portugal which have already destroyed 134,500 hectares -lrb- 332,000 acres -rrb- of land - more than in all of 2004 when just under 130,000 hectares burned . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heat wave fears rise as portugal burns as forest fires continue to rage throughout portugal , a deadly heat wave spreading across southern europe is causing concern in spain and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 umts : the next big thing is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surf on the beach , with your mobile phone a few years ago , many were preparing for the eventual death of umts .
but thanks to an increasingly wireless world , the " next big thing " in mobile phones is making a comeback . umts - the four letters that stand for universal mobile telecommunications system once sent excited chills through the mobile phone industry , promising fantastic technological leaps and big profits .
nowadays , it 's more likely to be the source of exasperated sighs , as one of the worst investments in the industry 's history . the once hyped umts standard -lrb- also called g3 -rrb- is still waiting for its big break .
an estimated 25 million mobile phones are equipped with the technology , but that number makes up only 1 percent of all phones worldwide . german experts say there are an estimated 500,000 umts clients in germany , including a few hundred thousand clients who surf the internet with their laptop using mobile cards . but only 10 percent of the umts network 's capacity in germany is being used , proof that five years after the country 's biggest telecoms companies handed the government 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.1 billion -rrb- for the right to use the network , the big break has been slow in coming . the next big thing tanks five years ago , the industry could n't get enough umts , widely tipping it to be the " next big thing . "
the massive amounts of data that could travel from mobile to mobile at high speeds promised the advent of television shows watched in the palm of a hand , and internet surfing anywhere on earth . but things have progressed a lot more slowly .
the stock market crash meant telecom companies soon ran out of the cash necessary to build umts networks .
mobile phone manufacturers took longer than expected in working out the technology 's bugs .
the first phones were heavy and clunky and did n't work properly . then came the arrival of a competitor nobody had counted on .
wireless lan networks also promised wireless surfing , for far less money .
at industry events like 2003 's technology trade fair cebit in hanover , germany , some wondered whether umts was on its way out . early-adaptors good for everyone telecom companies soon learned to welcome the competition .
thanks to w-lan technology more and more people are getting used to the concept of wireless surfing , made possible by surfing " hot spots " spread across cities all across the world .
whether it 's dw-world.de , bbc or cnn , all major web portals are now offering the possibility to surf their content with a mobile phone while on the road . bildunterschrift : dw-world readers get a chance to surf on their mobiles the news out of japan that young people are getting more and more used to watching short video clips on their mobiles is as encouraging .

but thanks to an increasingly wireless world , the " next big thing " in mobile phones is making a comeback . umts - the four letters that stand for universal mobile telecommunications system once sent excited chills through the mobile phone industry , promising fantastic technological leaps and big profits .
nowadays , it 's more likely to be the source of exasperated sighs , as one of the worst investments in the industry 's history . the once hyped umts standard -lrb- also called g3 -rrb- is still waiting for its big break .
an estimated 25 million mobile phones are equipped with the technology , but that number makes up only 1 percent of all phones worldwide . german experts say there are an estimated 500,000 umts clients in germany , including a few hundred thousand clients who surf the internet with their laptop using mobile cards . but only 10 percent of the umts network 's capacity in germany is being used , proof that five years after the country 's biggest telecoms companies handed the government 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.1 billion -rrb- for the right to use the network , the big break has been slow in coming . the next big thing tanks five years ago , the industry could n't get enough umts , widely tipping it to be the " next big thing . "
the massive amounts of data that could travel from mobile to mobile at high speeds promised the advent of television shows watched in the palm of a hand , and internet surfing anywhere on earth . but things have progressed a lot more slowly .
the stock market crash meant telecom companies soon ran out of the cash necessary to build umts networks .
mobile phone manufacturers took longer than expected in working out the technology 's bugs .
the first phones were heavy and clunky and did n't work properly . then came the arrival of a competitor nobody had counted on .
wireless lan networks also promised wireless surfing , for far less money .
at industry events like 2003 's technology trade fair cebit in hanover , germany , some wondered whether umts was on its way out . early-adaptors good for everyone telecom companies soon learned to welcome the competition .
thanks to w-lan technology more and more people are getting used to the concept of wireless surfing , made possible by surfing " hot spots " spread across cities all across the world .
whether it 's dw-world.de , bbc or cnn , all major web portals are now offering the possibility to surf their content with a mobile phone while on the road . bildunterschrift : dw-world readers get a chance to surf on their mobiles the news out of japan that young people are getting more and more used to watching short video clips on their mobiles is as encouraging .
though the price may still be prohibitive , the rates are sinking and it will only be a matter of time for mobile surfing is included in a flat rate offered phone clients when they sign their contracts . vodafone , the world market leader , is certainly optimistic , hoping for close to 10 million umts clients by early 2006 .
whether that will be enough to compensate for the millions spent five years ago is still up in the air .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 benedict : an effective faith-offensive ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi was welcomed like a pop star at the open air mass the successor to the charismatic john paul ii has been under close scrutiny on his first foreign visit as pope as to whether he can inspire the young as his predecessor did .
many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .
it has been really fun . "
world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .
" he is tough and will be able to move the church in a new direction , " said oliver boss , secretary to the archbishop of cologne .
" don ’ t underestimate him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 umts : the next big thing is back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surf on the beach , with your mobile phone a few years ago , many were preparing for the eventual death of umts .
but thanks to an increasingly wireless world , the " next big thing " in mobile phones is making a comeback . umts - the four letters that stand for universal mobile telecommunications system once sent excited chills through the mobile phone industry , promising fantastic technological leaps and big profits .
nowadays , it 's more likely to be the source of exasperated sighs , as one of the worst investments in the industry 's history . the once hyped umts standard -lrb- also called g3 -rrb- is still waiting for its big break .
an estimated 25 million mobile phones are equipped with the technology , but that number makes up only 1 percent of all phones worldwide . german experts say there are an estimated 500,000 umts clients in germany , including a few hundred thousand clients who surf the internet with their laptop using mobile cards . but only 10 percent of the umts network 's capacity in germany is being used , proof that five years after the country 's biggest telecoms companies handed the government 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.1 billion -rrb- for the right to use the network , the big break has been slow in coming . the next big thing tanks five years ago , the industry could n't get enough umts , widely tipping it to be the " next big thing . "
the massive amounts of data that could travel from mobile to mobile at high speeds promised the advent of television shows watched in the palm of a hand , and internet surfing anywhere on earth . but things have progressed a lot more slowly .
the stock market crash meant telecom companies soon ran out of the cash necessary to build umts networks .
mobile phone manufacturers took longer than expected in working out the technology 's bugs .
the first phones were heavy and clunky and did n't work properly . then came the arrival of a competitor nobody had counted on .
wireless lan networks also promised wireless surfing , for far less money .
at industry events like 2003 's technology trade fair cebit in hanover , germany , some wondered whether umts was on its way out . early-adaptors good for everyone telecom companies soon learned to welcome the competition .
thanks to w-lan technology more and more people are getting used to the concept of wireless surfing , made possible by surfing " hot spots " spread across cities all across the world .
whether it 's dw-world.de , bbc or cnn , all major web portals are now offering the possibility to surf their content with a mobile phone while on the road . bildunterschrift : dw-world readers get a chance to surf on their mobiles the news out of japan that young people are getting more and more used to watching short video clips on their mobiles is as encouraging .
though the price may still be prohibitive , the rates are sinking and it will only be a matter of time for mobile surfing is included in a flat rate offered phone clients when they sign their contracts . vodafone , the world market leader , is certainly optimistic , hoping for close to 10 million umts clients by early 2006 .
whether that will be enough to compensate for the millions spent five years ago is still up in the air .
but , in the end , vodafone , t-mobile and others will probably care less what sort of technology will be used : mobile surfing will make them lot 's of money in the coming years . holger hank -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world 's biggest it fair comes to town cebit , the trade fair that delivers the latest in technological innovation to an increasingly hungry public , opens this week in hanover .

apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .
nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?
what was he doing in sheerness , and how did he get there ?
as images of the haunted-looking figure went round the world and captured the public imagination , perplexed doctors reported that the man must have suffered some kind of nervous breakdown which had left him mute and stricken with amnesia . while missing persons helplines fielded hundreds of calls from people trying to identify him , the media was quick to pick up on his purported piano skills and floated various theories about his origins - one day , he was believed to be an irish student resident in norway , another day he was identified as a czech concert pianist , while yet another theory had him pegged as a french street musician . suicidal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truth appears to be somewhat less glamorous .
according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .

" he was obviously in a distressed state and did n't talk to police .
then it just went from there . " just a hoax allegedly , he also told hospital staff that he was a german who 'd travelled to britain by eurostar .
according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung , he comes from the small town of waldmünchen near the czech border in eastern bavaria .
he also revealed he 'd recently lost a job in paris , was gay , and had two sisters and a father who owned a farm . crucially , he also said that he 'd worked with mentally ill patients .
the revelation clears up at least one mystery - how a suicidal german managed to fool so many people for so long .
experts now believe he copied some of their behavioral mannerisms in order to convince therapists he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
his tactics worked . " his -lrb- behavior -rrb- is very reminiscent of autism , " said one doctor from the british autistic society .
a clinical psychologist from edinburgh university agreed .
" when people are suffering from this kind of catatonia syndrome it could be schizophrenia , " he said . with the piano man now back in germany , the mirror also reports that doctors are considering suing their former patient , arguing that his treatment cost the cash-strapped national health thousands of pounds and wasted expert time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's mental health headache health ministers and ngo representatives from the 52 member states in the world health organization ’ s european region have put their heads together in helsinki this week to discuss the issue of mental health .

apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .
nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?
what was he doing in sheerness , and how did he get there ?
as images of the haunted-looking figure went round the world and captured the public imagination , perplexed doctors reported that the man must have suffered some kind of nervous breakdown which had left him mute and stricken with amnesia . while missing persons helplines fielded hundreds of calls from people trying to identify him , the media was quick to pick up on his purported piano skills and floated various theories about his origins - one day , he was believed to be an irish student resident in norway , another day he was identified as a czech concert pianist , while yet another theory had him pegged as a french street musician . suicidal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truth appears to be somewhat less glamorous .
according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .
in fact , all he ever did was tap one key over and over again . " a nurse went into his room last friday and said ' are you going to speak to us today ? '
he simply answered , ' yes , i think i will , " ' a hospital insider told the paper . " he claims he was found by police as he was trying to commit suicide , " she added .
" he was obviously in a distressed state and did n't talk to police .
then it just went from there . " just a hoax allegedly , he also told hospital staff that he was a german who 'd travelled to britain by eurostar .
according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung , he comes from the small town of waldmünchen near the czech border in eastern bavaria .
he also revealed he 'd recently lost a job in paris , was gay , and had two sisters and a father who owned a farm . crucially , he also said that he 'd worked with mentally ill patients .
the revelation clears up at least one mystery - how a suicidal german managed to fool so many people for so long .
experts now believe he copied some of their behavioral mannerisms in order to convince therapists he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
his tactics worked . " his -lrb- behavior -rrb- is very reminiscent of autism , " said one doctor from the british autistic society .
a clinical psychologist from edinburgh university agreed .
" when people are suffering from this kind of catatonia syndrome it could be schizophrenia , " he said . with the piano man now back in germany , the mirror also reports that doctors are considering suing their former patient , arguing that his treatment cost the cash-strapped national health thousands of pounds and wasted expert time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's mental health headache health ministers and ngo representatives from the 52 member states in the world health organization ’ s european region have put their heads together in helsinki this week to discuss the issue of mental health .

but thanks to an increasingly wireless world , the " next big thing " in mobile phones is making a comeback . umts - the four letters that stand for universal mobile telecommunications system once sent excited chills through the mobile phone industry , promising fantastic technological leaps and big profits .
nowadays , it 's more likely to be the source of exasperated sighs , as one of the worst investments in the industry 's history . the once hyped umts standard -lrb- also called g3 -rrb- is still waiting for its big break .
an estimated 25 million mobile phones are equipped with the technology , but that number makes up only 1 percent of all phones worldwide . german experts say there are an estimated 500,000 umts clients in germany , including a few hundred thousand clients who surf the internet with their laptop using mobile cards . but only 10 percent of the umts network 's capacity in germany is being used , proof that five years after the country 's biggest telecoms companies handed the government 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 61.1 billion -rrb- for the right to use the network , the big break has been slow in coming . the next big thing tanks five years ago , the industry could n't get enough umts , widely tipping it to be the " next big thing . "
the massive amounts of data that could travel from mobile to mobile at high speeds promised the advent of television shows watched in the palm of a hand , and internet surfing anywhere on earth . but things have progressed a lot more slowly .
the stock market crash meant telecom companies soon ran out of the cash necessary to build umts networks .
mobile phone manufacturers took longer than expected in working out the technology 's bugs .
the first phones were heavy and clunky and did n't work properly . then came the arrival of a competitor nobody had counted on .
wireless lan networks also promised wireless surfing , for far less money .
at industry events like 2003 's technology trade fair cebit in hanover , germany , some wondered whether umts was on its way out . early-adaptors good for everyone telecom companies soon learned to welcome the competition .
thanks to w-lan technology more and more people are getting used to the concept of wireless surfing , made possible by surfing " hot spots " spread across cities all across the world .
whether it 's dw-world.de , bbc or cnn , all major web portals are now offering the possibility to surf their content with a mobile phone while on the road . bildunterschrift : dw-world readers get a chance to surf on their mobiles the news out of japan that young people are getting more and more used to watching short video clips on their mobiles is as encouraging .
though the price may still be prohibitive , the rates are sinking and it will only be a matter of time for mobile surfing is included in a flat rate offered phone clients when they sign their contracts . vodafone , the world market leader , is certainly optimistic , hoping for close to 10 million umts clients by early 2006 .
whether that will be enough to compensate for the millions spent five years ago is still up in the air .
but , in the end , vodafone , t-mobile and others will probably care less what sort of technology will be used : mobile surfing will make them lot 's of money in the coming years . holger hank -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the world 's biggest it fair comes to town cebit , the trade fair that delivers the latest in technological innovation to an increasingly hungry public , opens this week in hanover .
after a number of lean years , exhibitors are gradually returning in numbers .

often it all goes to plan for the big names but sometimes the script gets rewritten . fc cologne may be fifth in the bundesliga table but they crashed out of the german cup at the first hurdle with second division kickers offenbach triumphing 3-1 on saturday . cologne took a 29th minute lead through markus feulner but the sending-off of their zambian midfielder andrew sinkala after 56 minutes changed the complexion of the match . " we had the game under control for an hour and then came the sending off , " said cologne manager uwe rapolder .
" it is a shame to go out and it has shown us that there is work still to do . " qualid mokhtari leveled for offenbach in the 65th minute and suat turker then put the hosts in front seven minutes later .
former german international christian rahn scored an own goal four minutes from time to seal 10-man cologne 's misery . on the following monday dortmund were beaten 2-1 by the second division side eintracht braunschweig in a match watched by a passionate home crowd of 22,200 . jan koller gave bvb the lead on 28 minutes , but a brilliant diving header by jürgen rische on 41 and a dramatic 84th-minute strike from captain daniel graf took the underdogs into the second round and dumped the woeful big league visitors out of the cup . the other bundesliga teams in action over the weekend had little trouble in securing passage to the second round and big guns such as bayer leverkusen , werder bremen and sv hamburg were in fine form . most bundesliga sides progress at a stroll leverkusen crushed rot-weiss erfurt amateure 8-0 with serbia and montenegro star danko lazovic scoring a hat-trick inside ten minutes midway through the second half . " it was a great day for me , " lazovic said .
" i am just glad to have this chance at a great club like leverkusen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen , winners in 2004 , ran out 3-1 victors over wattenscheid while hamburg hammered stuttgart kickers 5-1 . hamburg crashed out 4-2 to sc paderborn in the first round of last season 's competition although it was later revealed that disgraced referee robert hoyer had manipulated the tie for financial gain . last season 's quarter-finalists paderborn had no time for giant killing this time around as they fell 2-0 to vfl wolfsburg . schalke 04 were runners-up to bayern munich in last season 's final and they justified their favorite tag with a 3-0 thrashing of unknowns bremerhaven . danish international soren larsen continues to shine since arriving in the close season scoring twice to help the visitors ease through . it was far from easy for bundesliga outfit hertha berlin who needed extra-time to defeat koblenz 3-2 . hertha were 2-1 down at one stage but brazilian marcelinho equalized and niko kovac scored the winner to save the club 's blushes . stuttgart let out of jail with extra-time victory vfb stuttgart had a scare against amateur club tsg hoffenheim on sunday .
the home side scraped through to the second round of the german cup with a 4-3 extra-time win .
the early season crisis , in which stuttgart have taken just a point from their opening two bundesliga matches , looked to be going from bad to worse when they fell 2-1 behind to the regional third division side at the end of the first half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new signing jon dahl tomasson equalized in the 54th minute to send the match into extra-time , however , and goals from croatia 's mario carevic and brazilian forward cacau sent them clear . hoffenheim defender matthias orum pulled one back late in the game but stuttgart held on for a much needed victory . cup holders bayern munich made light work of msv 1919 neuruppin in berlin on sunday , winning 4-0 in their first game of their defense . two goals from golden oldie mehmet scholl sealed the win after valerien ismael had opened the scoring with his first goal for bayern since his pre-season move from werder bremen .
youngster andreas ottl also got his first senior goal to ease the champions ' passage to the next round . while not such a giant force in their own league , hanover 96 are positively enormous compared to cologne amateurs who play in the regional third division .
the miss-matched tie on friday evening offered few surprises with the bundesliga outfit putting four past the youth team without reply . vahid hashemian , the iranian international signed by hanover from bayern munich , opened the scoring in the sixth minute .
hanover finished the game at a stroll after cologne 's tobias nickenig was sent off midway through the first half and completed the rout with goals from thomas brdaric , chavdar yankov and jiri stajner . the other top league side in action on friday was recently promoted eintracht frankfurt who won in less comfortable circumstances against rot-weiss oberhausen , holding on to a 2-1 victory for their first win of the season . new signings benjamin huggel and ioannis amanatidis put frankfurt 2-0 up before dalibor gataric 's reply 13 minutes from time set up a nervous finale . cottbus keeper the saviour and hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pick of the other six matches was the cliff-hanger between second division energie cottbus and amateurs rot-weiss essen which finished in favor of the professionals from the east after a dramatic penalty shoot-out which cottbus won 5-4 . the hero of the night was energie 's bosnian goalkeeper tomislav piplica -lrb- photo , right -rrb- who saved from lennart lynge larsen at 4-4 in the shootout before scoring the winner himself . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big names hoping to avoid cup slip-ups while there is no league action this weekend , bundesliga sides are still facing challenges in the first round of the dfb cup which traditionally throws davids and goliaths together .

how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?
not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches . in the days before stylists fussed over her hair and clothing and before public relations advisors taught her how to smile more , angela merkel was no one 's idea of the perfect chancellor candidate . now , the woman from the eastern german fishing village of templin is a vision in colorful button-down suits , and her face tries its very best to exude a politician 's false warmth . all that 's missing is a little rock n ' roll - and who better to provide that than the granddaddies of the genre themselves ? recently , angela - or angie , as her campaign staff would like germans to think of her - has been leaving the stage following her stump speeches to the strains of the rolling stones ' eponymous song . the soulful wail of mick jagger over a mournful melody of piano and guitar is , apparently , supposed to let germans know that this woman feels their pain .
but did anyone in her coterie think to pay a little bit more to what mick and co. were singing ?

for the organizers , it was a logistical nightmare that guaranteed complications .
a whole stretch of a major autobahn near the western german city was converted into a parking lot and one-way street so that busses could shuttle the young spiritual visitors away from the marienfeld with as little difficulty as possible for them and the expected return of vacationers in the state of north-rhine westphalia , where school starts again this week .
the german railway added an extra 400 trains to get the throngs back to cologne from the makeshift place of worship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict celebrates sunday mass , the climax of the world youth day in cologne dozens of journalists found out personally just what it means to be a pilgrim when they were sent from one exit to the next to find where the shuttle busses were departing .
but at the end of the day , security officials said that the million teens and early 20-year-olds were cooperative .
" all but 6,000 have left cologne -lrb- as of monday morning -rrb- , " was the word from the police .
security tight but seldom needed over the course of pope benedict 's four-day visit to germany , police reported that there were eight security breaches in the air , including a hot-air balloon that soared on saturday night over the marienfeld where wyd held its vigil .
on sunday , the pope-mobile took another route to the marienfeld due to the discovery of what appeared to be a bomb , but later turned out to be a fake .
" the guest was never exposed to a dangerous situation , " was the assessment from cologne 's police chief , klaus steffenhagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence was on hand but there were no major incidents during the six-day event in all , over 4,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia , bordering states and other european countries provided protection for the pope and to assure that matters remained under control .
the police reported that the majority of crimes committed during the span of wyd was primarily theft of articles from backpacks .
home hamlet receives low-flying pope while hundreds of thousands made their way by bus , boat and airplane back to their respective home countries , benedict boarded a plane that was chosen specifically for the pope as it 's named after the bavarian town of regensburg , where the he worked as a university professor for many years and still owns a house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents celebrated the pope 's election in front of the house where he was born on april 19 the residents of benedict 's birthplace , marktl am inn in bavaria , received their most-famous son in an unusual fashion .
it was n't a personal visit , but the pope 's airplane flew low enough for him to see the illuminated city .
the fire brigade shone spotlights on the house where benedict was born joseph ratzinger on april 16 , 1927 .
also , candles were lit to create an effect visible from the air .
it also was not limited to the visual .
from the plane 's cockpit , benedict communicated with marktl residents via radio and prayed with them . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?
not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches . in the days before stylists fussed over her hair and clothing and before public relations advisors taught her how to smile more , angela merkel was no one 's idea of the perfect chancellor candidate . now , the woman from the eastern german fishing village of templin is a vision in colorful button-down suits , and her face tries its very best to exude a politician 's false warmth . all that 's missing is a little rock n ' roll - and who better to provide that than the granddaddies of the genre themselves ? recently , angela - or angie , as her campaign staff would like germans to think of her - has been leaving the stage following her stump speeches to the strains of the rolling stones ' eponymous song . the soulful wail of mick jagger over a mournful melody of piano and guitar is , apparently , supposed to let germans know that this woman feels their pain .
but did anyone in her coterie think to pay a little bit more to what mick and co. were singing ?
and did anyone ask the kings of rock n ' roll if a conservative chancellor candidate in germany could even use the hit from 1973 ?

many say he did , in his own style . it was a simple lunch friday for pope benedict xvi at the seminary in cologne : an omelette and conversation with a dozen children from five continents .
but for this reputedly shy intellectual , the " bull dog " of doctrine at the vatican who was respected , admired and feared , it was anything but simple .
" he told me , ‘ i spoke little , i listened and i learned much , ’ " cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne told dw-world .
" he said that he came away from the experience amazed . "
as were the children : some told him of their homelands , others about their families and themselves .
" the issues we discussed were all very personal , " jason mackiewicz of new zealand told reporters .
bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi reached out to his young flock and non-catholics from his first appearance smiling and waving shyly from the helm of the boat sailing down the rhine to public addresses in front of the cathedral and at the huge mass at marienfeld , a former open pit mine , observers have watched and wondered if the shy man known for his intellectual cool could turn on the charm and woo the young back to an ailing church .
many say he did .
" he has his own style , more quiet than john paul , " said cardinal meisner .
" but i think we all saw how the young were inspired . "
a catholic " woodstock " they stood thigh-high in water to get a closer glimpse of the pontiff sailing by .
they waited for hours to get a spot to see the pope .
they spent all night under the stars to be able to hear him lead a final mass the next morning .
for many of the more then a million young pilgrims that traveled to the 6-day catholic convention , it was the pope that made world youth day extra special .
" it was awesome , so inspiring , " said erin rose , 19 , from the us , who attended sunday 's mass .
" it gave me the feeling to try to go to church more , pray more , be better . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes he abandoned the popemobile others said that while they may disagree with the church ’ s teachings on some topics such as premarital sex and contraception , benedict is still their religious leader .
" i want to hear what he has to say even if i don ’ t agree , " said pauline rividat of france .
" he is our leader and we have to at least listen and try to follow him . "
a spiritual party some young pilgrims said that they didn ’ t expect a chance to see the pope but wanted to come anyway .
" there is a real sense of togetherness here , " said kevin hoareau , 25 , of france .
" i got to meet lots of people from everywhere , and we laughed and prayed together .
it has been really fun . "
world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .
and he told members of the turkish community in germany that they must instruct and guide their children in the islamic faith and work with christians to stamp out terrorism .
an in spite of concerns when he was elected that he was not the type of church leader that could bring new vitality to the church as europe becomes increasingly secular , observers say that his quiet demeanor is misleading .
" he is tough and will be able to move the church in a new direction , " said oliver boss , secretary to the archbishop of cologne .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 when the pope and pilgrims have gone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " up the stairs to the jet , holiness " all but a fraction of the one million visitors have now left cologne after world youth day - an accomplishment that went over with only a few hitches . on sunday , one million visitors were trying to leave the marienfeld , a large meadow and formerly an open pit mine , 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- west of cologne after having celebrated mass with the pope .
for the organizers , it was a logistical nightmare that guaranteed complications .
a whole stretch of a major autobahn near the western german city was converted into a parking lot and one-way street so that busses could shuttle the young spiritual visitors away from the marienfeld with as little difficulty as possible for them and the expected return of vacationers in the state of north-rhine westphalia , where school starts again this week .
the german railway added an extra 400 trains to get the throngs back to cologne from the makeshift place of worship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict celebrates sunday mass , the climax of the world youth day in cologne dozens of journalists found out personally just what it means to be a pilgrim when they were sent from one exit to the next to find where the shuttle busses were departing .
but at the end of the day , security officials said that the million teens and early 20-year-olds were cooperative .
" all but 6,000 have left cologne -lrb- as of monday morning -rrb- , " was the word from the police .
security tight but seldom needed over the course of pope benedict 's four-day visit to germany , police reported that there were eight security breaches in the air , including a hot-air balloon that soared on saturday night over the marienfeld where wyd held its vigil .
on sunday , the pope-mobile took another route to the marienfeld due to the discovery of what appeared to be a bomb , but later turned out to be a fake .
" the guest was never exposed to a dangerous situation , " was the assessment from cologne 's police chief , klaus steffenhagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong police presence was on hand but there were no major incidents during the six-day event in all , over 4,000 police officers from north rhine-westphalia , bordering states and other european countries provided protection for the pope and to assure that matters remained under control .
the police reported that the majority of crimes committed during the span of wyd was primarily theft of articles from backpacks .
home hamlet receives low-flying pope while hundreds of thousands made their way by bus , boat and airplane back to their respective home countries , benedict boarded a plane that was chosen specifically for the pope as it 's named after the bavarian town of regensburg , where the he worked as a university professor for many years and still owns a house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents celebrated the pope 's election in front of the house where he was born on april 19 the residents of benedict 's birthplace , marktl am inn in bavaria , received their most-famous son in an unusual fashion .
it was n't a personal visit , but the pope 's airplane flew low enough for him to see the illuminated city .
the fire brigade shone spotlights on the house where benedict was born joseph ratzinger on april 16 , 1927 .
also , candles were lit to create an effect visible from the air .
it also was not limited to the visual .
from the plane 's cockpit , benedict communicated with marktl residents via radio and prayed with them . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de benedict : an effective faith-offensive ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.08.2005 piano man is bavarian ... and bogus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not what he seemed germany 's foreign ministry confirmed monday that the unidentified man who washed up on a british beach four months ago is a 20-year-old bavarian .
apparently he 's not an amnesiac - and not much of a piano-player either . over six feet tall , blonde and clad in a suit , the strange figure dubbed the " piano man " was found wandering along a beach in kent , south-east england in early april .
his clothes were drenched , and all the labels had been ripped out .
nothing about his person gave any clues whatsoever as to his identity , and he appeared unable to speak . who was he ?
what was he doing in sheerness , and how did he get there ?
as images of the haunted-looking figure went round the world and captured the public imagination , perplexed doctors reported that the man must have suffered some kind of nervous breakdown which had left him mute and stricken with amnesia . while missing persons helplines fielded hundreds of calls from people trying to identify him , the media was quick to pick up on his purported piano skills and floated various theories about his origins - one day , he was believed to be an irish student resident in norway , another day he was identified as a czech concert pianist , while yet another theory had him pegged as a french street musician . suicidal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the truth appears to be somewhat less glamorous .
according to british broadsheet the daily mirror , the piano man uttered his first words last friday , only to reveal that he can not play piano and only drew one for his doctors because it was the first thing that came into his head . reports that he astonished staff at the little brook hospital in dartford with his virtuoso playing were grossly exaggerated , said the paper .
in fact , all he ever did was tap one key over and over again . " a nurse went into his room last friday and said ' are you going to speak to us today ? '
he simply answered , ' yes , i think i will , " ' a hospital insider told the paper . " he claims he was found by police as he was trying to commit suicide , " she added .
" he was obviously in a distressed state and did n't talk to police .
then it just went from there . " just a hoax allegedly , he also told hospital staff that he was a german who 'd travelled to britain by eurostar .
according to germany 's süddeutsche zeitung , he comes from the small town of waldmünchen near the czech border in eastern bavaria .
he also revealed he 'd recently lost a job in paris , was gay , and had two sisters and a father who owned a farm . crucially , he also said that he 'd worked with mentally ill patients .
the revelation clears up at least one mystery - how a suicidal german managed to fool so many people for so long .
experts now believe he copied some of their behavioral mannerisms in order to convince therapists he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
his tactics worked . " his -lrb- behavior -rrb- is very reminiscent of autism , " said one doctor from the british autistic society .
a clinical psychologist from edinburgh university agreed .
" when people are suffering from this kind of catatonia syndrome it could be schizophrenia , " he said . with the piano man now back in germany , the mirror also reports that doctors are considering suing their former patient , arguing that his treatment cost the cash-strapped national health thousands of pounds and wasted expert time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : europe 's mental health headache health ministers and ngo representatives from the 52 member states in the world health organization ’ s european region have put their heads together in helsinki this week to discuss the issue of mental health .

world youth day was started 20 years ago by john paul who was greeted like a pop idol during his appearances .
during the convention , young people from almost 200 countries attend spiritual seminars and prayer sessions and generally fill the streets , singing and dancing .
and while john paul put much of his focus on the young and instructing them in religion and behavior during his appearances and during his 27 years as pontiff , benedict eschewed some of his predecessor ’ s gestures and themes and made piety , unity and outreach to non-catholics a primary theme of his visit .
bildunterschrift : some say he inspires them to be better in most of his addresses to the young , he eschewed instructing the pilgrims on abstinence .
instead , he told them to " open their hearts to god . "
he also became the first pope to visit a german synagogue and told jewish leaders that " we must do more " to improve relations between the two communities .
he told protestant clergy that he had a good reason to be optimistic of christian unity because of the " network of spiritual links " developing between the different churches .
benedict has been criticized by protestants for not living up to his promise of inclusiveness .

the save our sleeper -lrb- sos -rrb- campaign was launched in july to fight for the daily service between london and penzance .
the government has said the train loses £ 2.5m every year and it is feared it could be scrapped as part of the great western franchise renewal .
the train is popular with south west business travellers and is fully booked on many nights .
online petition charles kennedy , the leader of the liberal democrats , said losing the sleeper train would make it virtually impossible for people to travel from the region to london before midday .
included in the 2,000 signatures in the online petition , is a person from brazil .
the strategic rail authority has insisted that no decision about the service has been made yet .
the successful bidder for the new franchise , which will start on 1 april 2006 , will be chosen by the department of transport .

the gwent force is introducing taser guns from monday while it has already been used by north wales police .
on sunday , it emerged the dyfed-powys force was training officers to use the weapon , while south wales police says it will probably introduce it shortly .
amnesty international claims the guns have been linked to more than 70 deaths in america and canada .
the taser guns work by firing two darts up to 21 feet at a target , each trailing a wire which delivers a high-voltage shock that can disable suspects in order for them to be arrested .
the electrical current can penetrate clothing up to two inches thick .
the guns have been welcomed by some senior police officers as an effective but non-lethal method of halting a violent offender .
the us-based manufacturers of the device insist that it causes no long-term injuries and only short-term skin irritation .
dyfed-powys police has started training officers to use taser guns but critics argue taser shocks can induce a fatal reaction in people with underlying heart problems or with large quantities of drink or drugs in their blood .
north wales police was one of the first uk forces to use the weapons on the streets when a man in rhyl was fired at three times in august 2003 .
the man was examined later by a police surgeon for minor injuries but was found to be otherwise fit and well .
' another option ' gwent police chief superindendant alun thomas said the tasers used by his force have a micro-computer to record exactly how they are used .
he said : " the tasar along with baton guns have never been deemed as " non lethal " , we recognise there 's always going to be a risk .
" there have been trials in the uk and they have been shown to be very effective .
" they do provide us with yet another option in our armoury ... without recourse to live weapons . "
he added that a high-ranking officer would need to give permission before the weapon could be deployed .
on sunday , dyfed-powys police confirmed it has been training officers in how to use the weapons .
' long-term effects ' a spokesman for south wales police said it had no firm plans to introduce the weapon but said it probably would follow the trend to bring them in .
amnesty international claims more than 70 people have died in the usa and canada after being struck tasers .
spokesman huw thomas said : " we certainly do n't think it 's appropriate for gwent police to introduce them , nor any other force .
" we 're not asking for a total ban on tasers , but the point is that the long-term effects hav n't been tested enough .
" people have been known to die when they 're under the influence of alcohol or drugs having been shot by one of these things . "

the gwent force is introducing taser guns from monday while it has already been used by north wales police .
on sunday , it emerged the dyfed-powys force was training officers to use the weapon , while south wales police says it will probably introduce it shortly .
amnesty international claims the guns have been linked to more than 70 deaths in america and canada .
the taser guns work by firing two darts up to 21 feet at a target , each trailing a wire which delivers a high-voltage shock that can disable suspects in order for them to be arrested .
the electrical current can penetrate clothing up to two inches thick .
the guns have been welcomed by some senior police officers as an effective but non-lethal method of halting a violent offender .
the us-based manufacturers of the device insist that it causes no long-term injuries and only short-term skin irritation .
dyfed-powys police has started training officers to use taser guns but critics argue taser shocks can induce a fatal reaction in people with underlying heart problems or with large quantities of drink or drugs in their blood .
north wales police was one of the first uk forces to use the weapons on the streets when a man in rhyl was fired at three times in august 2003 .
the man was examined later by a police surgeon for minor injuries but was found to be otherwise fit and well .
' another option ' gwent police chief superindendant alun thomas said the tasers used by his force have a micro-computer to record exactly how they are used .
he said : " the tasar along with baton guns have never been deemed as " non lethal " , we recognise there 's always going to be a risk .
" there have been trials in the uk and they have been shown to be very effective .
" they do provide us with yet another option in our armoury ... without recourse to live weapons . "
he added that a high-ranking officer would need to give permission before the weapon could be deployed .
on sunday , dyfed-powys police confirmed it has been training officers in how to use the weapons .
' long-term effects ' a spokesman for south wales police said it had no firm plans to introduce the weapon but said it probably would follow the trend to bring them in .
amnesty international claims more than 70 people have died in the usa and canada after being struck tasers .
spokesman huw thomas said : " we certainly do n't think it 's appropriate for gwent police to introduce them , nor any other force .
" we 're not asking for a total ban on tasers , but the point is that the long-term effects hav n't been tested enough .
" people have been known to die when they 're under the influence of alcohol or drugs having been shot by one of these things . "

the beep beep !
day in wales is being launched at the three bears pre-school and nursery in cardiff on monday .
a group of toddlers will ride toys around a special road marked in the playground and wear the t-shirts .
adults with banners will also call on drivers to slow down around the nursery in st mellons .
we are calling on all drivers to help make roads safer for kids on foot or bike mary williams , chief executive brake sarah bayliss , manager at the three bears , said road-safety awareness is already taught to pre-schoolers at her nursery .
but it is not a compulsory part of the foundation stage for youngsters aged three and above , say the day 's organisers , the brake charity .
miss bayliss said : " luckily we take them to the local parks , they -lrb- toddlers -rrb- start with very little road sense but they do pick it up quite quickly .
" we use pelican crossings and we emphasise stop , look and listen and say it over and over again .
" we have also been talking about it in the nursery this week , " she added .
miss bayliss said the children enjoy learning about road safety in a ' fun ' way - and adults can also pick up useful reminders .
speed limit the event , also being organised by green flag motoring assistance , is expected to involve thousands of children across the uk .
the organisers want drivers to pledge to stay within speed limits at all times , especially around schools , nurseries and homes .
they also want drivers to drop their speed to 20 mph when children are about .
a child hit by a car travelling at 20mph has a 95 % chance of survival compared to a 15 % chance at 40mph .
in wales , four children under 16 were killed on foot in 2004 and 88 were seriously injured .
studies show children living in deprived area are most at risk from being involved in a road accident .
' crucial messages ' across the uk , children from those areas are five times more likely to be killed on foot than those in wealthy areas , said the charity .
mary williams obe , chief executive of brake , said : " many of the 92 children killed and seriously injured while walking in wales last year were mown down in their own neighbourhoods by local drivers .
" we are calling on all drivers to help make roads safer for kids on foot or bike by sticking within speed limits at all times . "
miss bayliss is urging all nursery leaders , teachers and parents to become involved in child safety .
" beep beep !
day is a fun way for us to get crucial messages across to the children , which we hope will help them to stay safe as they grow up , " she said .

the gwent force is introducing taser guns from monday while it has already been used by north wales police .
on sunday , it emerged the dyfed-powys force was training officers to use the weapon , while south wales police says it will probably introduce it shortly .
amnesty international claims the guns have been linked to more than 70 deaths in america and canada .
the taser guns work by firing two darts up to 21 feet at a target , each trailing a wire which delivers a high-voltage shock that can disable suspects in order for them to be arrested .
the electrical current can penetrate clothing up to two inches thick .
the guns have been welcomed by some senior police officers as an effective but non-lethal method of halting a violent offender .
the us-based manufacturers of the device insist that it causes no long-term injuries and only short-term skin irritation .
but critics argue taser shocks can induce a fatal reaction in people with underlying heart problems or with large quantities of drink or drugs in their blood .
north wales police was one of the first uk forces to use the weapons on the streets when a man in rhyl was fired at three times in august 2003 .
the man was examined later by a police surgeon for minor injuries but was found to be otherwise fit and well .
' another option ' gwent police chief superindendant alun thomas said the tasers used by his force have a micro-computer to record exactly how they are used .
he said : " the tasar along with baton guns have never been deemed as " non lethal " , we recognise there 's always going to be a risk .
" there have been trials in the uk and they have been shown to be very effective .
" they do provide us with yet another option in our armoury ... without recourse to live weapons . "
he added that a high-ranking officer would need to give permission before the weapon could be deployed .
on sunday , dyfed-powys police confirmed it has been training officers in how to use the weapons .
' long-term effects ' a spokesman for south wales police said it had no firm plans to introduce the weapon but said it probably would follow the trend to bring them in .
amnesty international claims more than 70 people have died in the usa and canada after being struck tasers .
spokesman huw thomas said : " we certainly do n't think it 's appropriate for gwent police to introduce them , nor any other force .
" we 're not asking for a total ban on tasers , but the point is that the long-term effects hav n't been tested enough .
" people have been known to die when they 're under the influence of alcohol or drugs having been shot by one of these things . "

in the first of the series we speak to a man who makes his living being fired out of a cannon .
human cannonball diego zeman is fired twice a day .
boom boom .
shot from a four metre gun , the circus stunt man flies through the air at speeds of up to 60mph , his mind always firmly set on that distant safety net .
diego comes on to the strains of rocket man the crowds roar , wide-eyed children clamour for his autograph and the hours are n't bad .

i feel free when i 'm flying - it 's a nice feeling - it 's a bit like bungee jumping diego zeman his brazilian father and hungarian mother were part of a big top acrobatic act based in eastern europe .
the young diego grew up around the performers and started training when he eight .
" i was born into the circus and started with the trapeze and high wire , " he says .
moving on to the job of human cannonball was therefore , for diego at least , an obvious next step .

" you have to fly straight , keep you body rigid and turn at exactly the right moment so that you land on your back , " explains cannon trainer marnie dock , who was the world 's first female human cannonball at the age of 16 .
there is also the small matter of making sure that diego is not fired headlong into the big top 's canopy , or the many wires strung-up for the circus ' acrobats , says marnie .
every time the circus moves , the cannon 's position and angle is precisely calculated .
a dummy model of diego is test fired several times to check everything is okay before the man himself starts work .

and while your act may last just a couple of minutes , the circus requires your presence throughout the shows as part of the troupe .
diego also has to control his weight -lrb- lest those calculations get messed up -rrb- and spends an hour or two in the gym every day , to strengthen his knees and back .
he has also been to the guyana space centre in french guyana , completing a course which helped him prepare his body for the rigours of being propelled at high speeds .
ironically it was his predecessor 's fear of flying in planes , as opposed to out of a cannon , that led to the job coming up when he refused to travel to south america for training .

a mighty row has broken out following a recent decision by one of the world 's largest producer of fine quality paper , norske skog , to slash 380 jobs and close one of its four paper factories in norway , even though the plant is profitable .
each of the politicians appears desperate either to gain political currency from the affair , or at least to not come across as if they do not care about the loss of jobs .
but beyond a great deal of hand wringing , which has led some commentators to suggest they are deliberately failing to grasp the commercial arguments behind norske skog 's decision in the run-up to the election , the affair has simply demonstrated the politicians ' impotence in the face of norske skog 's decision .
norske skog is sticking to its guns , insisting the factory must close due to overcapacity in the group 's european operations .
necessary step chief executive jan oksum has even rejected offers of fresh financial incentives to keep the factory in skien alive , having dismissed them as pre-election promises .
norske skog has also dismissed assertions by politicians across the spectrum that previously received indirect state support , such as favourably priced electricity for its factories , means it is indebted to norwegian society and thus has a duty to safeguard jobs .
what is important , insists mr oksum , is to make sure norske skog remains a profitable company .
" the imbalance between demand and capacity in the european market is lasting , " mr oksum wrote in a letter published by the newspaper aftenposten .
" we must therefore find a permanent solution .
" i would n't have subjected our employees and the company to this unless i was convinced that a closure of the mill is needed to strengthen norske skog and safeguard more than 6,000 jobs worldwide , " he insists .
indeed , norske skog 's finances have weakened dramatically in recent years : last year 's 210m norwegian kroner earnings compared poorly with the near nkr4bn it made in 2001 .
" we have a responsibility to reverse this trend , and must act before our results deteriorate further , " explains mr oksum , insisting that the factory closure and plans to shift some of the production to its other factories should shave nkr200m off its costs .
media backlash but regardless of whether or not there is solid industrial logic behind norske skog 's decision , its announcement seems particularly ill timed .
although norway 's politicians lack formal powers to prevent the factory 's closure , their ability to whip up bad publicity has proven to be great .
little more than one in 10 newspaper articles that have been written about the affair put the company in a good light , and most of those were published by specialist financial media , according to a survey .
norske skog 's insists this is because there are so many temporary workers in the newsrooms during summer , though there are clearly other reasons too .
one is the involvement of the flamboyant celebrity investors petter stordalen and oystein stray spetalen who have thrown their hats into the ring with a nkr100m offer to acquire the doomed factory .
their bid was immediately rejected , with norske skog insisting that the factory is not for sale since allowing new owners to take over would merely create a new competitor .
critics pointed out that it was obvious that norske skog would reject mr stordalen and mr spetalen 's bid and some cynics have dismissed the pair 's efforts to safeguard the jobs at the factory as little more than a publicity stunt .
the investors have rejected such claims and say their plan to produce book paper rather than newsprint at the factory should ensure they would not compete with norske skog .
regulatory scrutiny along with mr stordalen and mr spetalen , there are other , rather more discreet investors waiting in the wings .
such investor interest has attracted the attention of norway 's competition commission , which has vowed to look into whether norske skog 's refusal to sell the skien-based factory as a going concern means it is abusing its market power .
this probe comes on top of an ongoing investigation by brussels into allegations of price fixing .
the investigation relates to norske skog and its competitors stora enso of finland and holmen of sweden .
all the companies insist there is overcapacity in the european market and both financial analysts and investors agree .
some analysts anticipate a shift of paper production both to central europe where factories can be placed closer to their customers and to south america where high quality trees can be grown very fast .
indeed , us investment company capital group has raised its stake in norske skog to just over 10 % since the row broke out in norway , a move seen as an endorsement of the decision to shut the factory in skien .
but in the paper industry there is more than one type of investor .
about a fifth of norske skog 's share holders are norwegian forestry owners who depend on the company as a customer for their wares .
many of them are clearly deeply opposed to any plans to shift production out of the country , though there are no guarantees that even their voices will be heard .

a mighty row has broken out following a recent decision by one of the world 's largest producer of fine quality paper , norske skog , to slash 380 jobs and close one of its four paper factories in norway , even though the plant is profitable .
each of the politicians appears desperate either to gain political currency from the affair , or at least to not come across as if they do not care about the loss of jobs .
but beyond a great deal of hand wringing , which has led some commentators to suggest they are deliberately failing to grasp the commercial arguments behind norske skog 's decision in the run-up to the election , the affair has simply demonstrated the politicians ' impotence in the face of norske skog 's decision .
norske skog is sticking to its guns , insisting the factory must close due to overcapacity in the group 's european operations .
necessary step chief executive jan oksum has even rejected offers of fresh financial incentives to keep the factory in skien alive , having dismissed them as pre-election promises .
norske skog has also dismissed assertions by politicians across the spectrum that previously received indirect state support , such as favourably priced electricity for its factories , means it is indebted to norwegian society and thus has a duty to safeguard jobs .
what is important , insists mr oksum , is to make sure norske skog remains a profitable company .
" the imbalance between demand and capacity in the european market is lasting , " mr oksum wrote in a letter published by the newspaper aftenposten .
" we must therefore find a permanent solution .
" i would n't have subjected our employees and the company to this unless i was convinced that a closure of the mill is needed to strengthen norske skog and safeguard more than 6,000 jobs worldwide , " he insists .
indeed , norske skog 's finances have weakened dramatically in recent years : last year 's 210m norwegian kroner earnings compared poorly with the near nkr4bn it made in 2001 .
" we have a responsibility to reverse this trend , and must act before our results deteriorate further , " explains mr oksum , insisting that the factory closure and plans to shift some of the production to its other factories should shave nkr200m off its costs .
media backlash but regardless of whether or not there is solid industrial logic behind norske skog 's decision , its announcement seems particularly ill timed .
mr oksum is refusing to sell the paper factory although norway 's politicians lack formal powers to prevent the factory 's closure , their ability to whip up bad publicity has proven to be great .
little more than one in 10 newspaper articles that have been written about the affair put the company in a good light , and most of those were published by specialist financial media , according to a survey .
norske skog 's insists this is because there are so many temporary workers in the newsrooms during summer , though there are clearly other reasons too .
one is the involvement of the flamboyant celebrity investors petter stordalen and oystein stray spetalen who have thrown their hats into the ring with a nkr100m offer to acquire the doomed factory .
their bid was immediately rejected , with norske skog insisting that the factory is not for sale since allowing new owners to take over would merely create a new competitor .
critics pointed out that it was obvious that norske skog would reject mr stordalen and mr spetalen 's bid and some cynics have dismissed the pair 's efforts to safeguard the jobs at the factory as little more than a publicity stunt .
the investors have rejected such claims and say their plan to produce book paper rather than newsprint at the factory should ensure they would not compete with norske skog .
regulatory scrutiny along with mr stordalen and mr spetalen , there are other , rather more discreet investors waiting in the wings .
such investor interest has attracted the attention of norway 's competition commission , which has vowed to look into whether norske skog 's refusal to sell the skien-based factory as a going concern means it is abusing its market power .
this probe comes on top of an ongoing investigation by brussels into allegations of price fixing .
the investigation relates to norske skog and its competitors stora enso of finland and holmen of sweden .
all the companies insist there is overcapacity in the european market and both financial analysts and investors agree .
some analysts anticipate a shift of paper production both to central europe where factories can be placed closer to their customers and to south america where high quality trees can be grown very fast .
indeed , us investment company capital group has raised its stake in norske skog to just over 10 % since the row broke out in norway , a move seen as an endorsement of the decision to shut the factory in skien .
but in the paper industry there is more than one type of investor .
about a fifth of norske skog 's share holders are norwegian forestry owners who depend on the company as a customer for their wares .
many of them are clearly deeply opposed to any plans to shift production out of the country , though there are no guarantees that even their voices will be heard .

little more than one in 10 newspaper articles that have been written about the affair put the company in a good light , and most of those were published by specialist financial media , according to a survey .
norske skog 's insists this is because there are so many temporary workers in the newsrooms during summer , though there are clearly other reasons too .
one is the involvement of the flamboyant celebrity investors petter stordalen and oystein stray spetalen who have thrown their hats into the ring with a nkr100m offer to acquire the doomed factory .
their bid was immediately rejected , with norske skog insisting that the factory is not for sale since allowing new owners to take over would merely create a new competitor .
critics pointed out that it was obvious that norske skog would reject mr stordalen and mr spetalen 's bid and some cynics have dismissed the pair 's efforts to safeguard the jobs at the factory as little more than a publicity stunt .
the investors have rejected such claims and say their plan to produce book paper rather than newsprint at the factory should ensure they would not compete with norske skog .
regulatory scrutiny along with mr stordalen and mr spetalen , there are other , rather more discreet investors waiting in the wings .
such investor interest has attracted the attention of norway 's competition commission , which has vowed to look into whether norske skog 's refusal to sell the skien-based factory as a going concern means it is abusing its market power .
this probe comes on top of an ongoing investigation by brussels into allegations of price fixing .
the investigation relates to norske skog and its competitors stora enso of finland and holmen of sweden .
all the companies insist there is overcapacity in the european market and both financial analysts and investors agree .
some analysts anticipate a shift of paper production both to central europe where factories can be placed closer to their customers and to south america where high quality trees can be grown very fast .
indeed , us investment company capital group has raised its stake in norske skog to just over 10 % since the row broke out in norway , a move seen as an endorsement of the decision to shut the factory in skien .
but in the paper industry there is more than one type of investor .
about a fifth of norske skog 's share holders are norwegian forestry owners who depend on the company as a customer for their wares .
many of them are clearly deeply opposed to any plans to shift production out of the country , though there are no guarantees that even their voices will be heard .

" we need to appreciate that our fish have a critical role to play in africa 's development , " professor richard mkandawire , senior agricultural advisor for the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- told the bbc 's network africa programme .
" focused action at a national , regional and international level is needed to foster this . "
focused investment fish catches have fallen sharply across the continent in recent years , resulting in a significant decline in consumption .
scientific bodies believe small-scale fish farming is the answer to building up fish stocks , particularly in sub-saharan africa .
at the summit , it will call for targeted investment of $ 30m in small-scale projects in an effort to increase stocks by 10 % .
" we are talking about ponds on people 's farms , not enormous fish farms of the kind you see in scotland and elsewhere , " patrick dugan , the center 's deputy director-general , told the financial times .
increased investment would improve the preservation and packaging of fish and speed up its route to market , especially in coastal areas .
fisheries are a major source of employment in africa , with up to 10 million people working in the industry .
fish also has a key role to play in sustaining public health , professor mkandawire added , supplying a vital source of protein for hiv sufferers .
in that regard , it was vital that governments across africa worked together to improve management of stocks .
" national governments as well as the private sector have enough resources to stimulate the growth of aquaculture , " mr added .

the survey of over 2,000 people was carried out as part of the donation season , which aims to raise awareness of issues around organ donation .
just under half of those who had not joined the nhs organ donor register said they had not thought about it .
a further 30 % said they wanted to , but had " not got around to it " .
six out of 10 people believe there should be a change in the law to an opt-out system to mean that everyone would automatically be considered a potential donor unless they have specifically registered that they do not wish to be .
' tempting fate ' fears the survey also found most people vastly over-estimated the number of organ transplants carried out last year .
we hope that it will help raise awareness of the benefits of transplantation chris rudge , medical director of uk transplant life on the list : what it is like to wait for a transplant in fact , only 2,724 heart , lung , kidney , pancreas or liver transplants were carried out .
there are currently 7,708 people waiting for an organ transplant .
one in 10 of those questioned said they would not wish to donate their organs , but many had misconceptions over what donation involves .
over half said that they did n't want their body to be experimented on after their death a third believed they were too old or unwell for their organs to be of any use a fifth were concerned doctors would not fight as hard to save them if they knew they wished to be a donor , or that they might not really be dead when organs were removed a quarter felt it might " tempt fate " if they joined the register organ transplant experts said all of these concerns were incorrect .
in terms of their own organs , 54 % said they were most concerned about their heart .
the lungs were the main worry for one in six , over half of whom were smokers .
the survey also highlighted people 's lack of awareness about the human body .
a quarter did n't know that the kidneys filter waste products out of blood - 3 % believed it helped improve a person 's sex drive .
chris rudge , medical director of uk transplant - responsible for matching and allocating donated organs for transplant , and for maintaining the nhs organ donor register - said : " we are glad the bbc has chosen to draw attention to this very important issue .
" we hope that it will help raise awareness of the benefits of transplantation and encourage people to make an informed decision about joining the nhs organ donor register .
" the bbc survey confirms the widespread support that exists for organ donation in the uk and emphasises the vital need for people to talk about their own wishes with those close to them . "
a british medical association spokeswoman said : " what is worrying is that there is clearly still a lot of misunderstanding about organ donation .
" the survey revealed that a fifth of respondents thought that if they joined the register , doctors would not fight as hard to save their life .
this is totally incorrect . "
your comments i am register to donate bone marrow , blood and when the time comes , organs .
how can i expect someone to help my son if god forbid something awful happened to him , if i am not prepared to do the same for others .
i wo n't need them once i 'm gone and i 've never liked waste !
angela , welwyn garden city , herts i am firmly against an opt-out system nick , oxford i am firmly against an opt-out system .
it says that someone else has a right to parts of your body when you die , and i believe that is wrong .
it is up to the individual to decide what happens to their body both during their life and after their death .
nick , oxford i remember several years ago applying for a boots advantage card , and the form having a nice box to tick , to be automatically added to the organ donation register .
i thought this was a great idea , why do n't other companies follow suit ?
yet having just thought about it , i do n't think i 've ever brought this issue up with my parents .
who wants their 21 year old son talking about what should happen if they die ?
i imagine they would try to change to conversation immediately - sad really , we all have to go at some stage and a bus might have my number on it tomorrow .
laurence hellyer , guildford i would not be a donor , or support an opt out system .
such a system would be an abuse of power , and an incentive to criminal elements to murder and kill when the market appears .
don , chelmsford i 'm on the donor register and carry a donor card .
however , my family are against donation simply because they call it ' unnatural ' , and i 'm told that even if you are registered that relatives still have to consent to donation .
i 'm now married and my spouse will consent , but i 'm worried that my parents could still lead to my organs being wasted - or a nasty scene over my deathbed for my spouse .
ht , london , uk what about also having a system for mobile phones rather like the ice one for the in case of emergency contact ?
you could indicate your willingness to donate by adding a specific phrase e.g willing donor lorraine , milton keynes , bucks i would be happy for my organs to be used .
i 'm not registered , however , i would support an opt out system .
howard warner , isle of south uist i do not wish for any of my organs to be used after my death or before .
i also do not ever wish to be given anyone else 's organs .
i have several reasons for this , and i am not an extremist religious person by any means .
one of my intense dislikes is that cells from my body parts may be used in laboratories in the creation of life which will then be used / abused for furthering experiments .
this is a sick practice , and all the reassurances on earth that it will not happen will not convince me .
gerrard byrne , wiltshire , uk i am an organ donor , and always will be .
but i would n't agree with an opt-out system .
some religions forbid this -lrb- depending on your interpretation -rrb- .
but if people do refuse to donate , then they should be exempt from accepting a donation , unless there are special circumstances -lrb- a known transferable disease , for example -rrb- .
people generally do n't register , because of ignorance or laziness .
the ignorant we can educate , but i 'm not sure what to do about the lazy ones .
ian , london after my uncle succumbed to cancer , it was a very positive thing to hear that his donated corneas had helped restore the sight of two women .
it also made it much easier to properly discuss my wishes with my family ; being able to help someone after death is a uniquely human attribute .
tom , oxford uk my aunt had to have a liver transplant and very nearly died because of the wait .
she 's made an amazing recovery and is still living life to the full some 15 years later .
i 've been a registered organ donor since i was 16 and firmly believe in the opt-out system .
it 's the only way people can be made to understand the benefits of organ donation and can then make an informed decision about their wishes .
victoria , farnham , uk i 'm on the organ donor register , and find it crazy that my next of kin could still overrule my wishes in the event of my death sarah , uk i 'm on the organ donor register , and find it crazy that my next of kin could still overrule my wishes in the event of my death - and ignore my express wishes .
at a time of immense stress , it seems unfair that loved ones have to make such decisions .
i would fully back an ' opt-out ' approach , as i think people probably feel more strongly if they are against it , and it seems a terrible shame that valuable organs are lost , merely because of apathy on the part of would-be donors .
sarah , uk i think that an opt-out system is not a bad idea .
if that is not used , then it would be easy to improve the system , simply by ensuring that people who do register to be donors are allowed to be donors .
at the moment , even if someone wants to be a donor and then dies , their family can over-ride their wishes and refuse for them to be donors .
it seems to me that the person 's wishes should be honoured instead of their families .
debbie , uk i have carried the same organ donor card since august 1986 and i am on the nhs organ donor register .
back in 1986 the card allowed you to stipulate what organs could be taken , with a section that states " take them all " .
when you are gone you are gone .
once my time is up , let someone else make use of these organs which have given me such a great life .
i have discussed it with my wife and she knows it is important to me .
david , cheshire i have an organ donor card , my only concern is that medical staff will miss it should anything happen to me , maybe there should be a universal database where people can sign up for donating their organs .

the survey of over 2,000 people was carried out as part of the donation season , which aims to raise awareness of issues around organ donation .
just under half of those who had not joined the nhs organ donor register said they had not thought about it .
a further 30 % said they wanted to , but had " not got around to it " .
six out of 10 people believe there should be a change in the law to an opt-out system to mean that everyone would automatically be considered a potential donor unless they have specifically registered that they do not wish to be .

over half said that they did n't want their body to be experimented on after their death a third believed they were too old or unwell for their organs to be of any use a fifth were concerned doctors would not fight as hard to save them if they knew they wished to be a donor , or that they might not really be dead when organs were removed a quarter felt it might " tempt fate " if they joined the register organ transplant experts said all of these concerns were incorrect .
in terms of their own organs , 54 % said they were most concerned about their heart .
the lungs were the main worry for one in six , over half of whom were smokers .
the survey also highlighted people 's lack of awareness about the human body .
a quarter did n't know that the kidneys filter waste products out of blood - 3 % believed it helped improve a person 's sex drive .
chris rudge , medical director of uk transplant - responsible for matching and allocating donated organs for transplant , and for maintaining the nhs organ donor register - said : " we are glad the bbc has chosen to draw attention to this very important issue .
" we hope that it will help raise awareness of the benefits of transplantation and encourage people to make an informed decision about joining the nhs organ donor register .
" the bbc survey confirms the widespread support that exists for organ donation in the uk and emphasises the vital need for people to talk about their own wishes with those close to them . "
a british medical association spokeswoman said : " what is worrying is that there is clearly still a lot of misunderstanding about organ donation .
" the survey revealed that a fifth of respondents thought that if they joined the register , doctors would not fight as hard to save their life .
this is totally incorrect . "
your comments i am register to donate bone marrow , blood and when the time comes , organs .
how can i expect someone to help my son if god forbid something awful happened to him , if i am not prepared to do the same for others .
i wo n't need them once i 'm gone and i 've never liked waste !
angela , welwyn garden city , herts i am firmly against an opt-out system nick , oxford i am firmly against an opt-out system .
it says that someone else has a right to parts of your body when you die , and i believe that is wrong .
it is up to the individual to decide what happens to their body both during their life and after their death .
nick , oxford i remember several years ago applying for a boots advantage card , and the form having a nice box to tick , to be automatically added to the organ donation register .
i thought this was a great idea , why do n't other companies follow suit ?
yet having just thought about it , i do n't think i 've ever brought this issue up with my parents .
who wants their 21 year old son talking about what should happen if they die ?
i imagine they would try to change to conversation immediately - sad really , we all have to go at some stage and a bus might have my number on it tomorrow .
laurence hellyer , guildford i would not be a donor , or support an opt out system .
such a system would be an abuse of power , and an incentive to criminal elements to murder and kill when the market appears .
don , chelmsford i 'm on the donor register and carry a donor card .
however , my family are against donation simply because they call it ' unnatural ' , and i 'm told that even if you are registered that relatives still have to consent to donation .
i 'm now married and my spouse will consent , but i 'm worried that my parents could still lead to my organs being wasted - or a nasty scene over my deathbed for my spouse .
ht , london , uk what about also having a system for mobile phones rather like the ice one for the in case of emergency contact ?
you could indicate your willingness to donate by adding a specific phrase e.g willing donor lorraine , milton keynes , bucks i would be happy for my organs to be used .
i 'm not registered , however , i would support an opt out system .
howard warner , isle of south uist i do not wish for any of my organs to be used after my death or before .
i also do not ever wish to be given anyone else 's organs .
i have several reasons for this , and i am not an extremist religious person by any means .
one of my intense dislikes is that cells from my body parts may be used in laboratories in the creation of life which will then be used / abused for furthering experiments .
this is a sick practice , and all the reassurances on earth that it will not happen will not convince me .
gerrard byrne , wiltshire , uk i am an organ donor , and always will be .
but i would n't agree with an opt-out system .
some religions forbid this -lrb- depending on your interpretation -rrb- .
but if people do refuse to donate , then they should be exempt from accepting a donation , unless there are special circumstances -lrb- a known transferable disease , for example -rrb- .
people generally do n't register , because of ignorance or laziness .
the ignorant we can educate , but i 'm not sure what to do about the lazy ones .
ian , london after my uncle succumbed to cancer , it was a very positive thing to hear that his donated corneas had helped restore the sight of two women .
it also made it much easier to properly discuss my wishes with my family ; being able to help someone after death is a uniquely human attribute .
tom , oxford uk my aunt had to have a liver transplant and very nearly died because of the wait .
she 's made an amazing recovery and is still living life to the full some 15 years later .
i 've been a registered organ donor since i was 16 and firmly believe in the opt-out system .
it 's the only way people can be made to understand the benefits of organ donation and can then make an informed decision about their wishes .
victoria , farnham , uk i 'm on the organ donor register , and find it crazy that my next of kin could still overrule my wishes in the event of my death sarah , uk i 'm on the organ donor register , and find it crazy that my next of kin could still overrule my wishes in the event of my death - and ignore my express wishes .
at a time of immense stress , it seems unfair that loved ones have to make such decisions .
i would fully back an ' opt-out ' approach , as i think people probably feel more strongly if they are against it , and it seems a terrible shame that valuable organs are lost , merely because of apathy on the part of would-be donors .
sarah , uk i think that an opt-out system is not a bad idea .
if that is not used , then it would be easy to improve the system , simply by ensuring that people who do register to be donors are allowed to be donors .
at the moment , even if someone wants to be a donor and then dies , their family can over-ride their wishes and refuse for them to be donors .
it seems to me that the person 's wishes should be honoured instead of their families .
debbie , uk i have carried the same organ donor card since august 1986 and i am on the nhs organ donor register .
back in 1986 the card allowed you to stipulate what organs could be taken , with a section that states " take them all " .
when you are gone you are gone .
once my time is up , let someone else make use of these organs which have given me such a great life .
i have discussed it with my wife and she knows it is important to me .
david , cheshire i have an organ donor card , my only concern is that medical staff will miss it should anything happen to me , maybe there should be a universal database where people can sign up for donating their organs .

your comments i am register to donate bone marrow , blood and when the time comes , organs .
how can i expect someone to help my son if god forbid something awful happened to him , if i am not prepared to do the same for others .
i wo n't need them once i 'm gone and i 've never liked waste !
angela , welwyn garden city , herts " i am firmly against an opt-out system " nick , oxford i am firmly against an opt-out system .
it says that someone else has a right to parts of your body when you die , and i believe that is wrong .
it is up to the individual to decide what happens to their body both during their life and after their death .
nick , oxford i remember several years ago applying for a boots advantage card , and the form having a nice box to tick , to be automatically added to the organ donation register .
i thought this was a great idea , why do n't other companies follow suit ?
yet having just thought about it , i do n't think i 've ever brought this issue up with my parents .
who wants their 21 year old son talking about what should happen if they die ?
i imagine they would try to change to conversation immediately - sad really , we all have to go at some stage and a bus might have my number on it tomorrow .
laurence hellyer , guildford i would not be a donor , or support an opt out system .
such a system would be an abuse of power , and an incentive to criminal elements to murder and kill when the market appears .
don , chelmsford i 'm on the donor register and carry a donor card .
however , my family are against donation simply because they call it ' unnatural ' , and i 'm told that even if you are registered that relatives still have to consent to donation .
i 'm now married and my spouse will consent , but i 'm worried that my parents could still lead to my organs being wasted - or a nasty scene over my deathbed for my spouse .
ht , london , uk what about also having a system for mobile phones rather like the ice one for the in case of emergency contact ?
you could indicate your willingness to donate by adding a specific phrase e.g willing donor lorraine , milton keynes , bucks i would be happy for my organs to be used .
i 'm not registered , however , i would support an opt out system .
howard warner , isle of south uist i do not wish for any of my organs to be used after my death or before .
i also do not ever wish to be given anyone else 's organs .
i have several reasons for this , and i am not an extremist religious person by any means .
one of my intense dislikes is that cells from my body parts may be used in laboratories in the creation of life which will then be used / abused for furthering experiments .
this is a sick practice , and all the reassurances on earth that it will not happen will not convince me .
gerrard byrne , wiltshire , uk i am an organ donor , and always will be .
but i would n't agree with an opt-out system .
some religions forbid this -lrb- depending on your interpretation -rrb- .
but if people do refuse to donate , then they should be exempt from accepting a donation , unless there are special circumstances -lrb- a known transferable disease , for example -rrb- .
people generally do n't register , because of ignorance or laziness .
the ignorant we can educate , but i 'm not sure what to do about the lazy ones .
ian , london after my uncle succumbed to cancer , it was a very positive thing to hear that his donated corneas had helped restore the sight of two women .
it also made it much easier to properly discuss my wishes with my family ; being able to help someone after death is a uniquely human attribute .
tom , oxford uk my aunt had to have a liver transplant and very nearly died because of the wait .
she 's made an amazing recovery and is still living life to the full some 15 years later .
i 've been a registered organ donor since i was 16 and firmly believe in the opt-out system .
it 's the only way people can be made to understand the benefits of organ donation and can then make an informed decision about their wishes .
victoria , farnham , uk " i 'm on the organ donor register , and find it crazy that my next of kin could still overrule my wishes in the event of my death " sarah , uk i 'm on the organ donor register , and find it crazy that my next of kin could still overrule my wishes in the event of my death - and ignore my express wishes .
at a time of immense stress , it seems unfair that loved ones have to make such decisions .
i would fully back an ' opt-out ' approach , as i think people probably feel more strongly if they are against it , and it seems a terrible shame that valuable organs are lost , merely because of apathy on the part of would-be donors .
sarah , uk i think that an opt-out system is not a bad idea .
if that is not used , then it would be easy to improve the system , simply by ensuring that people who do register to be donors are allowed to be donors .
at the moment , even if someone wants to be a donor and then dies , their family can over-ride their wishes and refuse for them to be donors .
it seems to me that the person 's wishes should be honoured instead of their families .
debbie , uk i have carried the same organ donor card since august 1986 and i am on the nhs organ donor register .
back in 1986 the card allowed you to stipulate what organs could be taken , with a section that states " take them all " .
when you are gone you are gone .
once my time is up , let someone else make use of these organs which have given me such a great life .
i have discussed it with my wife and she knows it is important to me .
david , cheshire i have an organ donor card , my only concern is that medical staff will miss it should anything happen to me , maybe there should be a universal database where people can sign up for donating their organs .

the last two years have seen the virtual transformation of the global music industry due to physical and online piracy , falling sales of cds , and the rise of legal downloads and portable music players such as the ipod .
but the impact has been as great on consumers , who have seen the way they can buy and use music change just as radically .
no company represents that shift in the music industry better than napster .
once a byword for piracy , it is now a firm at the vanguard of online services . "
there are still people fearful of a cannibalistic effect of digital on their cash cow plastic retail business " brad duea , napster napster has around 410,000 subscribers who pay up to £ 14.95 each month to gain access to about 1.5 million songs .
it was once a file-sharing service that let people exchange music , usually pirated , and other files .
but after the us courts shut it down , the power of its brand remained .
' way down ' mr duea says : " the number one brand attribute at the time napster was shut down was innovation .
the second highest characteristic was actually ' free ' .
" the difference now is that the number one attribute is still innovation .
free is now way down on the list . "
technology firm roxio bought the napster brand from the ruins that was left of the file-sharing service and relaunched it as a paid-for operation .
key players : bbc three 's stuart murphy the global music market is now worth $ 33 billion -lrb- £ 18.3 billion -rrb- a year while the online music market accounted for around 5 % of all sales in the first half of 2005 .
just a handful of legitimate online music stores were in existence two years ago - now there are around 300 different services up and running .
mr duea says the online music industry will become an " exploding multi-billion dollar space in the next two years " .
flat sales " it 's larger than a niche but not yet mainstream , " he says .
as cd sales remain either flat or falling in many countries , some observers are predicting that digital sales will outstrip physical sales in the near future .
but mr duea says that day has already come for hundreds of thousands of people .
" many people have moved beyond buying plastic at retail and have moved to digital only already , " he says .
" people are able to search for more music than was ever possible at retail , even in the largest megastore . "
mr duea talks about napster as an " experience " rather than as a retailer .
with features such as friends ' lists , recommendations , the ability to swap playlists , access to more than a million songs and carry potentially tens of thousands of songs with you wherever you go , it is clear that use of a service like napster has little in common with popping into hmv or virgin to buy a record .
' forced bundle ' many cds , says mr duea , are " a forced bundle by the labels " . "
steve jobs has tricked people into buying a hardware trap " brad duea " if you are a subscriber you can listen to the latest cds and never again be caught buying a bad cd which has one hit song and all the rest are crap .
" the consumer got caught buying cds which only had one good song .
now what it will move to is rewarding those artists that put out great music that people listen to . "
mr duea says online music sales can transform the whole spectrum of music production and consumption - from artist to music lover .
the most high profile of all the services is probably apple 's itunes , which has a very different model to napster 's .
there are no subscribers to itunes , users purchase songs either on a per track basis or in the form of albums .
it has sold more than 500 million songs world-wide , but mr duea is critical of the approach apple has taken .
he says apple boss steve jobs has " tricked people into buying a hardware trap " as itunes songs can only be taken away and played on an ipod .
and the ubiquitous ipod itself can play paid-for songs with copy protection that are bought from itunes and none of the other services , but it can play any mp3s .
' work seamlessly ' apple 's approach means the market remains essentially cut down the middle - between the itunes service , which works only on the ipod , and services which use a windows media format , essentially everyone else .
" the dream is that napster would work on any pc , any player in any territory and work seamlessly , " said mr duea .
napster 's subscription model has been criticised by some because users do not " own " the music .
it remains as part of their collection - either on a pc or on a portable player - for only as long as they continue to subscribe .
" a lot of time people think of ownership as this ultimate thing with music .
" has owning cassettes in the past really benefited people ?
in many cases they have had to repurchase music in a new format .
" i do not think the argument about ownership is such a wonderful thing .
what do you really want as a music fan ?
it 's to access music and listening to music . "
despite the explosion in legitimate music services , the industry has been criticised for reacting slowly to new technologies .
mr duea says : " there are still people with a myopic view of music and are fearful of a cannibalistic effect of digital on their cash cow plastic retail business . "

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- dumped in zimbabwe 's poor villages bbc news / africa graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 22 august 2005 , 08:25 gmt 09:25 uk dumped in zimbabwe 's poor villages by justin pearce bbc news website , zimbabwe in the second of his series following an undercover trip to zimbabwe , justin pearce reports that the government 's policy of moving city dwellers to rural areas is worsening the effects of food shortages .
for thomas and his wife , charity , it was not a happy homecoming .
in fact , it was not really a homecoming at all .
the zimbabwean government had decided that the young couple belonged in a village deep in the dry bush of matabeleland north province , in western zimbabwe .
thomas was born there , but had not lived there since childhood .
his ageing grandmother is his only relative still living in the village .
" they were not pleased to receive us since we came empty-handed , " thomas said .
" they are in a difficult situation with drought .
it was a difficult moment for them . "
the united nations estimates that up to four million zimbabweans will need food aid over the coming year - mostly in rural areas .
thomas , 23 , and charity , 21 , had made a living as informal traders in a squatter camp in bulawayo , zimbabwe 's second largest city , some 200 km away .
' filth ' that came to an end in july , when the government 's operation murambatsvina -lsb- drive out rubbish -rsb- reached the place where they were living .
" we were harassed by police who destroyed our shack - that 's why we had to come to this place , " thomas said .
" the police said there was too much filth in this city . "
the story he tells is typical of the unknown numbers of zimbabwean city dwellers who have been dumped in country districts where they have few useful survival skills .
zimbabwean humanitarian staff say that after destroying homes in the cities and moving people into transit camps , the government assigned people to rural areas on the basis of their identity numbers .
on the identity cards carried by all zimbabwean citizens , the first few digits form a code for the bearer 's home area .
this , however , reflects one 's ancestral home rather than one 's own birthplace . "
they want total political control - they want to peasantify people like pol pot " archbishop pius ncube " some do n't want to go home because they have nothing there , " says a zimbabwean who is involved in church-based relief efforts .
" some may be the second or third generation to be born in the cities .
there are some zimbabweans who do n't have a rural area . "
strategy the government 's critics believe that the relocations are part of a strategy to reassert control over urban people who have voted overwhelmingly for the opposition in recent elections .
" they want total political control - they want to peasantify people like -lsb- former cambodian leader -rsb- pol pot - force them into they country so they can control them , " says the catholic archbishop of bulawayo , pius ncube .

thomas and charity have no means of making a living after being taken out of the city for thomas and his wife , charity , it was not a happy homecoming .
in fact , it was not really a homecoming at all .
the zimbabwean government had decided that the young couple belonged in a village deep in the dry bush of matabeleland north province , in western zimbabwe .
thomas was born there , but had not lived there since childhood .
his ageing grandmother is his only relative still living in the village .
" they were not pleased to receive us since we came empty-handed , " thomas said .
" they are in a difficult situation with drought .
it was a difficult moment for them . "
the united nations estimates that up to four million zimbabweans will need food aid over the coming year - mostly in rural areas .
thomas , 23 , and charity , 21 , had made a living as informal traders in a squatter camp in bulawayo , zimbabwe 's second largest city , some 200 km away .
' filth ' that came to an end in july , when the government 's operation murambatsvina -lsb- drive out rubbish -rsb- reached the place where they were living .
the villages are an alien environment to people born and bred in the cities " we were harassed by police who destroyed our shack - that 's why we had to come to this place , " thomas said .
" the police said there was too much filth in this city . "
the story he tells is typical of the unknown numbers of zimbabwean city dwellers who have been dumped in country districts where they have few useful survival skills .
zimbabwean humanitarian staff say that after destroying homes in the cities and moving people into transit camps , the government assigned people to rural areas on the basis of their identity numbers .
on the identity cards carried by all zimbabwean citizens , the first few digits form a code for the bearer 's home area .
this , however , reflects one 's ancestral home rather than one 's own birthplace .
they want total political control - they want to peasantify people like pol pot archbishop pius ncube " some do n't want to go home because they have nothing there , " says a zimbabwean who is involved in church-based relief efforts .
" some may be the second or third generation to be born in the cities .
there are some zimbabweans who do n't have a rural area . "
strategy the government 's critics believe that the relocations are part of a strategy to reassert control over urban people who have voted overwhelmingly for the opposition in recent elections .
" they want total political control - they want to peasantify people like -lsb- former cambodian leader -rsb- pol pot - force them into they country so they can control them , " says the catholic archbishop of bulawayo , pius ncube .
people have become dependent on aid from churches " in the countryside they have no newspaper or radio except zanu-pf propaganda , and they are controlled by the chiefs , who support the government . "
