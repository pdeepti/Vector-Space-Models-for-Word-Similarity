" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .
we 'll be the more relaxed team , that 's good .
we 'll make a few chances and we have to score - we know if we do n't we 'll be on the plane home . " brazilian legend plots downfall of home nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico for zico the stakes do n't come much higher for while this competition is no world cup wednesday 's game pits him against his country of birth for the first time since taking over from philippe troussier as japan coach . " it 's an extremely special game for me .
when i hear the national anthem i 'll be very emotional but the minute it 's over i 'll be working for japan , " said the former brazil star . zico reported no injury concerns as he gave the players who did n't figure in sunday 's 1-0 win over greece a training session held in the searing afternoon heat at the viktoria football ground on the outskirts of cologne .
the stadium had seen better days with the japan squad looking a whole lot healthier than the decaying terraces which were overrun with weeds after losing their fight against nature . despite having an interpreter like his shadow by his side zico more often than not prefers to communicate his wishes visually rather than verbally , and his skills are paying off with japan the first team to qualify for the world cup . pressure normal for brazil , warns zico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assessing wednesday 's assignment the 52-year-old echoed kawaguchi 's thoughts saying : " brazil have all the pressure .
that may be good for japan , but then again the brazil players are used to coping with pressure . " reflecting on his work as japan coach he added : " what i 'm trying to do here is make the team more balanced , more powerful and organized . " mexico win shatters illusion of invincibility he inevitably declined to discuss tactics , but it wo n't have escaped his notice that mexico 's game plan of closing down the midfield , defending to the death and counter-attacking wherever possible seemed to work well enough in hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico has tried to impress on his team the importance of treating brazil not like football gods but like any other team .
" brazil have so many talented players , but so do i , " he explained .
" there 's not a lot of difference between teams today , everyone can beat anyone .
okay brazil are a great team , but they can be beaten - we 've got to go out and win . " zico and his players will hope to do just that .

" there is a special european social model to protect that has developed on the continent , " said schröder , who will likely be facing early elections in september .
" through the integration of europe , the common market and later the common currency , we have been able to overcome the forms of nationalism that brought our continent so much suffering , " he said . " those who want to destroy this model due to national egotism or populist motives do a terrible disservice to the desires and rights of the next generation . " " leveling europe to a pure market " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder in happier times schröder , who was speaking at a book presentation in berlin , said europe was faced with an identity crisis that went far deeper than differences over financing or the constitution . " at its heart , it is about the question , which europe do we want ? " he said . " do we want a single europe that it able to take action , a true political union as is foreseen in the constitution ?
or do we want a big free-trade union , do we want to go from the european union back to the european economic community ? " he said there was no doubt europe needed a political union and warned against " leveling -lrb- europe -rrb- down to a pure market . " over the weekend in brussels , schröder blamed the " inflexible " stance of blair for the breakdown of eu budget negotiations for 2007 - 2013 , saying blair 's steadfast refusal to back down on britain 's long-cherished eu rebate worth around 4.6 billion euros yearly killed any possible deal . since then other european leaders such as luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , have joined the chorus in accusing blair of trying to reduce the bloc to little more than a free-trade zone . britain takes on eu presidency amid crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels ' generous farm subsidies are a sticking point in the current crisis engulfing the eu blair has dug in his heels and refused to give up the controversial rebate until eu leaders decide to overhaul and reform farm subsidies which swallow some 40 percent of the eu budget . on monday , blair reiterated his stance during a speech to the house of commons in london , saying : " it was not the right concept for great britain and it was not the right concept for europe . " the acrimony comes at a time when blair is preparing to take over the six-month rotating eu presidency on july 1 and is expected to pour oil on troubled waters .
blair , who is due to deliver a speech to the european parliament on thursday about his vision for europe and his plans for the next six months , said tuesday he thought a deal could be reached this time . " we see our role in presidency in part as also trying to launch that debate , and do it in a constructive way , do it in a way that 's open to the views of others and tries to get some form of consensus as to how we move forward , " blair said . british pragmatism but no deal on budget but experts remain skeptical . janis emmanouilidis , expert on the eu at the center for applied policy research in munich said it was doubtful that a deal on eu finances could be reached during blair 's presidency . emmanouilidis said the row over money had exposed two diametrically opposite political directions within the bloc : while schröder , chirac and juncker see the eu as a visionary social model and not just as a politically enriched trade zone , blair was treading in the neoliberal footsteps of former british prime minister margaret thatcher . " but blair wo n't initiate this debate during his term because he knows that such theoretical discussions do n't strike a chord among citizens , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is one of the few eu countries whose economy is doing well the eu expert added that blair instead would focus on " british pragmatism " during his term as eu president or in other words the liberalism versus protectionism debates .
emmanouilidis added that given britain 's healthy economy , blair naturally had the better arguments . the eu expert concluded that blair 's presidency would be marked , not so much by concrete things , but rather by lots of discussions .
" but controversial debates are also urgently needed , " emmanouildis said .
" it 's about economic orientation and the prospects that europe needs to be able to function in the long term . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de quo vadis , europe ?

under the rule , attacking players who do not receive the ball are not automatically offside even if they are standing beyond the last defender .
referees have effectively been given more freedom to interpret whether the player is interfering with play or not - known as passive offside .
tunisia 's veteran french coach roger lemerre said on monday that the rule had only complicated matters and pointed to an incident in his side 's 3-0 defeat to germany to illustrate his point of his view .
" look at the pictures of a free kick taken by germany , and you 'll see that -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack is in front of the goalkeeper and in an offside position .
when you know the rule , he is obstructing the goalkeeper 's view and for me he is interfering with play , " said lemerre who guided france to the 2002 european championships . www-links from the fringe : dw-world 's confed cup blog what is the problem with the offside rule ?
it is a very simple concept which is much maligned , often tampered with , regularly questioned and always used as the basis of jokes about women 's understanding of soccer .

but upon closer examination , it turned out the suspected victim of foul play found a peat bog in the town of uchte , lower saxony , was actually slightly older than first thought , some 2,700 years older .
many of the body 's hundred-odd parts were first dug out of the moor in 2000 .
at the time , the police homicide unit was assigned to the case , but when they failed to solve it , the file was archived and the moor body forgotten .
different case then in january of this year , a local worker discovered a shriveled hand in the bog while digging turf .
the police were once again put on the case , but this time , they recognized that the body was an archeological find rather than a criminal one .
on monday , scientists said radiocarbon dating showed the bog body belonged to a teenage girl - her age is estimated between 16 and 20 - who lived around 650 bc .
the state authority for historic preservation in lower saxony called the body " one of the most meaningful archeological finds of the past forty years . "
a unique find according to henning hassmann , the state archeologist of lower saxony , all the parts of the corpse appear to have been found except for one shoulder blade , though much of it was strewn about by modern digging equipment .

only one body , found in the netherlands , came from the bronze age .
it is about 1,000 years older than the current find , which is being called " the girl of the uchter moor . "
technological developments have made the discovery of intact bog bodies increasingly rare .
whereas people used to dig peat by hand , today huge machines make deep furrows in the dried out moors .
thus small , mummified body parts - which are almost the same color as the peat - remain undiscovered .
a mummified body was last found in lower saxony 50 years ago .
corpse on exhibit paleobiologist andreas bauerochse said the " girl of the moor " will be examined for clues to life 2,000 years ago .
the find will keep scientists busy for a long time , he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview .
" today we have a handful of questions .

but upon closer examination , it turned out the suspected victim of foul play found a peat bog in the town of uchte , lower saxony , was actually slightly older than first thought , some 2,700 years older .
many of the body 's hundred-odd parts were first dug out of the moor in 2000 .
at the time , the police homicide unit was assigned to the case , but when they failed to solve it , the file was archived and the moor body forgotten .
different case then in january of this year , a local worker discovered a shriveled hand in the bog while digging turf .
the police were once again put on the case , but this time , they recognized that the body was an archeological find rather than a criminal one .
on monday , scientists said radiocarbon dating showed the bog body belonged to a teenage girl - her age is estimated between 16 and 20 - who lived around 650 bc .
the state authority for historic preservation in lower saxony called the body " one of the most meaningful archeological finds of the past forty years . "
a unique find according to henning hassmann , the state archeologist of lower saxony , all the parts of the corpse appear to have been found except for one shoulder blade , though much of it was strewn about by modern digging equipment .

only one body , found in the netherlands , came from the bronze age .
it is about 1,000 years older than the current find , which is being called " the girl of the uchter moor . "
technological developments have made the discovery of intact bog bodies increasingly rare .
whereas people used to dig peat by hand , today huge machines make deep furrows in the dried out moors .

a mummified body was last found in lower saxony 50 years ago .
corpse on exhibit paleobiologist andreas bauerochse said the " girl of the moor " will be examined for clues to life 2,000 years ago .
the find will keep scientists busy for a long time , he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview .

" there is a special european social model to protect that has developed on the continent , " said schröder , who will likely be facing early elections in september .
" through the integration of europe , the common market and later the common currency , we have been able to overcome the forms of nationalism that brought our continent so much suffering , " he said .

blair , who is due to deliver a speech to the european parliament on thursday about his vision for europe and his plans for the next six months , said tuesday he thought a deal could be reached this time .

" but blair wo n't initiate this debate during his term because he knows that such theoretical discussions do n't strike a chord among citizens , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is one of the few eu countries whose economy is doing well the eu expert added that blair instead would focus on " british pragmatism " during his term as eu president or in other words the liberalism versus protectionism debates .
emmanouilidis added that given britain 's healthy economy , blair naturally had the better arguments . the eu expert concluded that blair 's presidency would be marked , not so much by concrete things , but rather by lots of discussions .
" but controversial debates are also urgently needed , " emmanouildis said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.06.2005 ancient ' bog body ' unearthed in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand belonging to " the girl of the uchter moor " a body found in a peat bog in northern germany , first thought to be a murder victim , turned out to be a sensational archeological find : the 2,700 year old mummified corpse of a teenage girl . at first the police thought the body of a teenage girl they were alerted to was evidence in an unsolved murder case .
but upon closer examination , it turned out the suspected victim of foul play found a peat bog in the town of uchte , lower saxony , was actually slightly older than first thought , some 2,700 years older .
many of the body 's hundred-odd parts were first dug out of the moor in 2000 .
at the time , the police homicide unit was assigned to the case , but when they failed to solve it , the file was archived and the moor body forgotten .
different case then in january of this year , a local worker discovered a shriveled hand in the bog while digging turf .
the police were once again put on the case , but this time , they recognized that the body was an archeological find rather than a criminal one .
on monday , scientists said radiocarbon dating showed the bog body belonged to a teenage girl - her age is estimated between 16 and 20 - who lived around 650 bc .
the state authority for historic preservation in lower saxony called the body " one of the most meaningful archeological finds of the past forty years . "
a unique find according to henning hassmann , the state archeologist of lower saxony , all the parts of the corpse appear to have been found except for one shoulder blade , though much of it was strewn about by modern digging equipment .
even the hair on the corpse 's head was intact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peat diggers found this hand the state museum of lower saxony said it is the only extensively preserved human body dating from the pre-roman iron age to be found in europe north of the alps .
other bog bodies have been found , but they are typically older - dating usually from around the time of christ 's birth .
only one body , found in the netherlands , came from the bronze age .
it is about 1,000 years older than the current find , which is being called " the girl of the uchter moor . "
technological developments have made the discovery of intact bog bodies increasingly rare .
whereas people used to dig peat by hand , today huge machines make deep furrows in the dried out moors .
thus small , mummified body parts - which are almost the same color as the peat - remain undiscovered .
a mummified body was last found in lower saxony 50 years ago .
corpse on exhibit paleobiologist andreas bauerochse said the " girl of the moor " will be examined for clues to life 2,000 years ago .
the find will keep scientists busy for a long time , he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in an interview .
" today we have a handful of questions .
in a week it will probably be two handfuls , " he said .
starting this thursday , the body will be on display for a short time in the state museum , where the public will have a chance to see the body before scientists begin testing . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding germany 's temple of the sun a project to faithfully reconstruct a 7,000 year-old solar observatory , the oldest of its kind in europe , began this week at goseck in the german state of saxony .

" there is a special european social model to protect that has developed on the continent , " said schröder , who will likely be facing early elections in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.06.2005 kids need a big scalp to convince doubters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are relishing the chance to get one over argentina germany 's young confed cup team are unbeaten in two games , scoring seven goals on the way to the semi-finals and yet , few are convinced of their credentials .
beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .
as it is , the top two face each other to see who wins the group and avoids the winner of group b in the last four . commentators have been loath to praise the germany team despite the two victories and seven goals which have put them on top of group a. many have accused them of lacking class and that the successes have not been convincing with a narrow 4-3 win against lowly australia and a late 3-0 defeat of tunisia . on closer inspection , this germany team is operating in a very traditional way and this confederations cup campaign is very similar to that of the 2002 world cup , a campaign which saw germany under-perform on their way to the final only to lose to a free-flowing , confident brazil team at the peak of its powers . parallels with world cup 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon during the 2002 world cup semi-final , june 25 , 2002 .
in japan / korea , germany struggled to overcome the likes of paraguay , the united states and south korea - all 1-0 wins - to make the final .
they thrashed saudi arabia 8-0 in their opening group game but drew 1-1 with the republic of ireland and managed a 2-0 win over cameroon .
there was very little in the way of real competition and germany , on the whole , struggled but still managed to reach the world cup final . but germany won the games that mattered in japan / korea and they are doing the same in the confederations cup where there are fewer games and fewer chances to get it right .
just as in the last world cup , germany have advanced with less than convincing performances but still find themselves in the last four of a major international tournament . big teams the biggest test for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and just as in 2002 , germany 's route to glory may very well be barred by one of the world 's best teams .
argentina will be the germans ' first real test of the tournament and there will be no complacency despite the fact both are through the group stages .
germany will want to beat argentina not just to get top spot and the chance to play the runners-up of group b -lrb- which could be brazil or japan -rrb- but to prove that they can win against the top teams in the world when it matters . argentina will feel empowered by mexico 's defeat of brazil and this will enhance their belief that they can win this trophy .
as the current in-form south american team , argentina will consider themselves favourites for the cup .
but they must first do away with germany .
the 2-2 draw in a friendly this year showed that the germans can raise their game but whether they can raise it enough to beat the argentineans remains to be seen . the match on thursday evening may be the dress rehearsal for the final if germany and argentina can overcome mexico , brazil or japan in the semi-finals .
a win for either side will give a psychological advantage to the victors . australia , tunisia playing for national pride bildunterschrift : in the other group a game , australia and tunisia will play it out for the pride factor of finishing third in the group after two defeats .
neither will want to return home after thursday night without any points on the board .
neither team can feel ashamed with their performances ; australia have taken both germany and argentina to the wire while tunisia have showed a flowing style of soccer that offers great potential for the future . however , it is a consolation game and the result will mean nothing in the context of the whole tournament .
this wo n't stop two proud teams going for it for themselves and the fans . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gets a break , then two more what a difference 15 minutes can make .
germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .
during the us-eu summit , us president bush said he wanted the crisis-hit bloc to be a " strong " global partner .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- at summit , us has little room to gloat reconstruction in iraq and the situation in the middle east are on the official agenda for monday 's eu-us summit in washington .
but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion .
-lrb- june 20 , 2005 -rrb- nato leaders agree on iraq assistance in what was widely regarded as a largely symbolic pledge , us president george w. bush won support from his nato allies to assist in the training of iraqi security forces on tuesday .

" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .
we 'll be the more relaxed team , that 's good .
we 'll make a few chances and we have to score - we know if we do n't we 'll be on the plane home . " brazilian legend plots downfall of home nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico for zico the stakes do n't come much higher for while this competition is no world cup wednesday 's game pits him against his country of birth for the first time since taking over from philippe troussier as japan coach . " it 's an extremely special game for me .
when i hear the national anthem i 'll be very emotional but the minute it 's over i 'll be working for japan , " said the former brazil star . zico reported no injury concerns as he gave the players who did n't figure in sunday 's 1-0 win over greece a training session held in the searing afternoon heat at the viktoria football ground on the outskirts of cologne .
the stadium had seen better days with the japan squad looking a whole lot healthier than the decaying terraces which were overrun with weeds after losing their fight against nature . despite having an interpreter like his shadow by his side zico more often than not prefers to communicate his wishes visually rather than verbally , and his skills are paying off with japan the first team to qualify for the world cup . pressure normal for brazil , warns zico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assessing wednesday 's assignment the 52-year-old echoed kawaguchi 's thoughts saying : " brazil have all the pressure .
that may be good for japan , but then again the brazil players are used to coping with pressure . " reflecting on his work as japan coach he added : " what i 'm trying to do here is make the team more balanced , more powerful and organized . " mexico win shatters illusion of invincibility he inevitably declined to discuss tactics , but it wo n't have escaped his notice that mexico 's game plan of closing down the midfield , defending to the death and counter-attacking wherever possible seemed to work well enough in hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico has tried to impress on his team the importance of treating brazil not like football gods but like any other team .
" brazil have so many talented players , but so do i , " he explained .
" there 's not a lot of difference between teams today , everyone can beat anyone .
okay brazil are a great team , but they can be beaten - we 've got to go out and win . " zico and his players will hope to do just that .

" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .

" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .
we 'll be the more relaxed team , that 's good .
we 'll make a few chances and we have to score - we know if we do n't we 'll be on the plane home . " brazilian legend plots downfall of home nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico for zico the stakes do n't come much higher for while this competition is no world cup wednesday 's game pits him against his country of birth for the first time since taking over from philippe troussier as japan coach . " it 's an extremely special game for me .
when i hear the national anthem i 'll be very emotional but the minute it 's over i 'll be working for japan , " said the former brazil star . zico reported no injury concerns as he gave the players who did n't figure in sunday 's 1-0 win over greece a training session held in the searing afternoon heat at the viktoria football ground on the outskirts of cologne .
the stadium had seen better days with the japan squad looking a whole lot healthier than the decaying terraces which were overrun with weeds after losing their fight against nature . despite having an interpreter like his shadow by his side zico more often than not prefers to communicate his wishes visually rather than verbally , and his skills are paying off with japan the first team to qualify for the world cup . pressure normal for brazil , warns zico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assessing wednesday 's assignment the 52-year-old echoed kawaguchi 's thoughts saying : " brazil have all the pressure .
that may be good for japan , but then again the brazil players are used to coping with pressure .

but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .

the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.06.2005 kids need a big scalp to convince doubters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are relishing the chance to get one over argentina germany 's young confed cup team are unbeaten in two games , scoring seven goals on the way to the semi-finals and yet , few are convinced of their credentials .
beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .
as it is , the top two face each other to see who wins the group and avoids the winner of group b in the last four . commentators have been loath to praise the germany team despite the two victories and seven goals which have put them on top of group a. many have accused them of lacking class and that the successes have not been convincing with a narrow 4-3 win against lowly australia and a late 3-0 defeat of tunisia . on closer inspection , this germany team is operating in a very traditional way and this confederations cup campaign is very similar to that of the 2002 world cup , a campaign which saw germany under-perform on their way to the final only to lose to a free-flowing , confident brazil team at the peak of its powers . parallels with world cup 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon during the 2002 world cup semi-final , june 25 , 2002 .
in japan / korea , germany struggled to overcome the likes of paraguay , the united states and south korea - all 1-0 wins - to make the final .
they thrashed saudi arabia 8-0 in their opening group game but drew 1-1 with the republic of ireland and managed a 2-0 win over cameroon .
there was very little in the way of real competition and germany , on the whole , struggled but still managed to reach the world cup final . but germany won the games that mattered in japan / korea and they are doing the same in the confederations cup where there are fewer games and fewer chances to get it right .
just as in the last world cup , germany have advanced with less than convincing performances but still find themselves in the last four of a major international tournament . big teams the biggest test for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and just as in 2002 , germany 's route to glory may very well be barred by one of the world 's best teams .
argentina will be the germans ' first real test of the tournament and there will be no complacency despite the fact both are through the group stages .
germany will want to beat argentina not just to get top spot and the chance to play the runners-up of group b -lrb- which could be brazil or japan -rrb- but to prove that they can win against the top teams in the world when it matters . argentina will feel empowered by mexico 's defeat of brazil and this will enhance their belief that they can win this trophy .
as the current in-form south american team , argentina will consider themselves favourites for the cup .
but they must first do away with germany .
the 2-2 draw in a friendly this year showed that the germans can raise their game but whether they can raise it enough to beat the argentineans remains to be seen . the match on thursday evening may be the dress rehearsal for the final if germany and argentina can overcome mexico , brazil or japan in the semi-finals .
a win for either side will give a psychological advantage to the victors . australia , tunisia playing for national pride bildunterschrift : in the other group a game , australia and tunisia will play it out for the pride factor of finishing third in the group after two defeats .
neither will want to return home after thursday night without any points on the board .
neither team can feel ashamed with their performances ; australia have taken both germany and argentina to the wire while tunisia have showed a flowing style of soccer that offers great potential for the future . however , it is a consolation game and the result will mean nothing in the context of the whole tournament .
this wo n't stop two proud teams going for it for themselves and the fans . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gets a break , then two more what a difference 15 minutes can make .

private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .

one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .

" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .

" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history .

private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .

one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin .

thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .

" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.06.2005 kids need a big scalp to convince doubters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are relishing the chance to get one over argentina germany 's young confed cup team are unbeaten in two games , scoring seven goals on the way to the semi-finals and yet , few are convinced of their credentials .
beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .
as it is , the top two face each other to see who wins the group and avoids the winner of group b in the last four . commentators have been loath to praise the germany team despite the two victories and seven goals which have put them on top of group a. many have accused them of lacking class and that the successes have not been convincing with a narrow 4-3 win against lowly australia and a late 3-0 defeat of tunisia . on closer inspection , this germany team is operating in a very traditional way and this confederations cup campaign is very similar to that of the 2002 world cup , a campaign which saw germany under-perform on their way to the final only to lose to a free-flowing , confident brazil team at the peak of its powers . parallels with world cup 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon during the 2002 world cup semi-final , june 25 , 2002 .
in japan / korea , germany struggled to overcome the likes of paraguay , the united states and south korea - all 1-0 wins - to make the final .
they thrashed saudi arabia 8-0 in their opening group game but drew 1-1 with the republic of ireland and managed a 2-0 win over cameroon .
there was very little in the way of real competition and germany , on the whole , struggled but still managed to reach the world cup final . but germany won the games that mattered in japan / korea and they are doing the same in the confederations cup where there are fewer games and fewer chances to get it right .
just as in the last world cup , germany have advanced with less than convincing performances but still find themselves in the last four of a major international tournament . big teams the biggest test for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and just as in 2002 , germany 's route to glory may very well be barred by one of the world 's best teams .
argentina will be the germans ' first real test of the tournament and there will be no complacency despite the fact both are through the group stages .
germany will want to beat argentina not just to get top spot and the chance to play the runners-up of group b -lrb- which could be brazil or japan -rrb- but to prove that they can win against the top teams in the world when it matters . argentina will feel empowered by mexico 's defeat of brazil and this will enhance their belief that they can win this trophy .

under the rule , attacking players who do not receive the ball are not automatically offside even if they are standing beyond the last defender .
referees have effectively been given more freedom to interpret whether the player is interfering with play or not - known as passive offside .
tunisia 's veteran french coach roger lemerre said on monday that the rule had only complicated matters and pointed to an incident in his side 's 3-0 defeat to germany to illustrate his point of his view .
" look at the pictures of a free kick taken by germany , and you 'll see that -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack is in front of the goalkeeper and in an offside position .
when you know the rule , he is obstructing the goalkeeper 's view and for me he is interfering with play , " said lemerre who guided france to the 2002 european championships . www-links from the fringe : dw-world 's confed cup blog what is the problem with the offside rule ?
it is a very simple concept which is much maligned , often tampered with , regularly questioned and always used as the basis of jokes about women 's understanding of soccer .

but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .

the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros .

but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .

the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros .

referees have effectively been given more freedom to interpret whether the player is interfering with play or not - known as passive offside .
tunisia 's veteran french coach roger lemerre said on monday that the rule had only complicated matters and pointed to an incident in his side 's 3-0 defeat to germany to illustrate his point of his view .
" look at the pictures of a free kick taken by germany , and you 'll see that -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack is in front of the goalkeeper and in an offside position .

merkel , who is set to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder in possible early elections in september , told reporters that it made little sense now to seek a country to blame for the failure of budget talks at a weekend summit .
" germany , if it must be an honest broker , must not be -lrb- for example -rrb- for poland and against france or against france and for another country , " merkel said .
" everything must be done to build bridges again in europe . "
she said that the mutual recriminations seen now were unproductive , in an attack on schröder but also french president jacques chirac and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , for laying the blame squarely at british prime minister tony blair 's feet .
" germany must again become an honest broker for the interests of all those involved in the eu , " she said .
european leaders failed to agree at the summit on a common budget starting in 2007 , a move that led juncker to describe the 25-country bloc as being in a " deep crisis . "
many in europe blamed blair for the collapse over his refusal to give up britain 's long-cherished eu rebate without an iron-clad guarantee of a thorough re-think of the way the bloc spends its taxpayers ' money .

the moves were part of a crackdown on foreign militants , made possible by newly tightened immigration laws . an egyptian and an afghan have been expelled from germany for suspected terrorist links and dozens of other deportations are pending , authorities in the southern state of bavaria said monday .
both men were sent to their respective home countries last week , the state interior ministry said in a statement .
it added that 15 other deportation notices had been served and a further 22 were being prepared .
' extremely dangerous ' it gave no details on the afghan case , because investigations were continuing .
the egyptian , omar yousif , was expelled for threatening german security and supporting a terrorist organizion , the ministry said .
the ministry said he had trained in pakistan at a camp of lashkar-e-taiba , an islamist group fighting against india in the disputed region of kashmir .
security authorities described yousif , who had been in detention since december , as " extremely dangerous and prepared to do violence . "
new laws make deportation easier german security services have tightened surveillance on islamist radicals since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
three of the suicide pilots in those attacks lived in hamburg .
as a result of a new immigration law that took effect jan .
1 , it is now easier to deport suspected foreign militants .
bavaria has been among the most aggressive states in applying the new law , with 12 alleged " extremists and hate preachers " removed since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister the two latest cases " show bavaria is continuing to take a tough line on islamist extremists and swiftly end their residence in germany , " said conservative state interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- .
if the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- win national elections expected in september - as they are widely expected to do - beckstein will likely be a candidate to run the federal interior ministry .
anti-immigration campaign platform in a statement that set off a wave of controversy , beckstein told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the cdu / csu would conduct its campaign in the coming elections on an anti-immigration platform .
voters have the choice between a policy of " massive immigration " if they vote for the social democrat-green party coalition , or one " without immigration , but with extensive family policies , life long work , and permanent further education . "
populist rhetoric ?
the comment unleashed loud resistance and accusations of using dangerously populist tactics , even from the cdu / csu allied free democrats .
the fdp spokesman for interior issues , max stadler , said the plan to base an election on immigration issues took a " populist approach " " nobody would be in favor of massive immigration to germany , " he told the dpa news agency , " that is an accusation that has nothing to do with reality and only serves to get your own followers riled up for the campaign . "
fdp steering committee member sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told handelsblatt on monday that the comments were " the most sickening kind of campaign rhetoric . "
and the head of the german institute for economic development -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , told the paper that such parries " corrupt the social climate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.06.2005 iraq seeks support at brussels conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multinational forces are still trying to restore stability more than 80 foreign ministers and officials began gathering in brussels ahead of a conference wednesday aimed at showing solidarity with violence-wracked iraq and to hear baghdad 's plans for rebuilding it . iraqi officials arrived in brussels tuesday hoping to lay out their plans for the country 's democratic development and convince the us , the eu and others to pony up the support they have promised . iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari , part of a 30-strong delegation headed by prime minister ibrahim jaafari , hopes the talks will support his government as it drafts a new constitution and prepares for elections later this year , reported afp . " the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .
during the us-eu summit , us president bush said he wanted the crisis-hit bloc to be a " strong " global partner .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- at summit , us has little room to gloat reconstruction in iraq and the situation in the middle east are on the official agenda for monday 's eu-us summit in washington .

germany tied 2-2 with argentina on tuesday night , making the hosts the winner of confed cup group a. the result puts both teams through to the next round . germany still ca n't beat the big boys .
the tournament hosts twice surrender the lead after goals from brazilian-born striker kevin kuranyi -lrb- 29min -rrb- and gerald asamoah -lrb- 51 -rrb- saw germany forge ahead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand , center , watches the ball as argentina 's esteban cambiasso , unseen , scores his side 's second goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between germany and argentina in nuremberg , southern germany , tuesday , june 21 , 2005 .

mexico have qualified from group b but brazil and japan face off on wednesday for the other spot .
germany manager jürgen klinsmann will be delighted to be two games from winning the trophy but will rue a glorious chance to end their miserable run against the big teams .
not since october 2000 have germany defeated a recognized top team when england fell 1-0 in the final game at wembley stadium .
" we 've come a long way , especially tactically , " said klinsmann about his young team after the match .
" that makes us more confident and each player able to believe that we can be a contender at this level .
i believe we 're on the right path . "
klinsmann chose to rest captain michael ballack , scorer of two penalties in the competition so far , with bernd schneider taking over the captain 's armband .
germany starts strong the hosts started the more promising but argentina should have scored in the 16th minute when carlos tevez crossed brilliantly from the right but luciano figueroa headed over .
argentina then had a controlled spell of possession but gave the ball away cheaply at the back and were made to pay in the 29th minute .
a thomas hitzlsperger free-kick took a series of pinball deflections in the penalty area and the ball fell to kuranyi who prodded in .
but the lead lasted just three minutes as villareal star riquelme curled a delightful free-kick past timo hildebrand to restore parity .

-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- hildebrand was making a rare start between the german posts but could do nothing about the exquisite strike .
the interval seemed to benefit germany and in the 51st minute they retook the lead through asamoah .
kuranyi saw the run of schalke star asamoah and the powerful front-man drilled a shot low into the corner .
the two teams met in dusseldorf back in february and germany twice led only to be pegged back late on at 2-2 .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .

" but blair wo n't initiate this debate during his term because he knows that such theoretical discussions do n't strike a chord among citizens , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is one of the few eu countries whose economy is doing well the eu expert added that blair instead would focus on " british pragmatism " during his term as eu president or in other words the liberalism versus protectionism debates .
emmanouilidis added that given britain 's healthy economy , blair naturally had the better arguments . the eu expert concluded that blair 's presidency would be marked , not so much by concrete things , but rather by lots of discussions .

" we see our role in presidency in part as also trying to launch that debate , and do it in a constructive way , do it in a way that 's open to the views of others and tries to get some form of consensus as to how we move forward , " blair said . british pragmatism but no deal on budget but experts remain skeptical . janis emmanouilidis , expert on the eu at the center for applied policy research in munich said it was doubtful that a deal on eu finances could be reached during blair 's presidency . emmanouilidis said the row over money had exposed two diametrically opposite political directions within the bloc : while schröder , chirac and juncker see the eu as a visionary social model and not just as a politically enriched trade zone , blair was treading in the neoliberal footsteps of former british prime minister margaret thatcher . " but blair wo n't initiate this debate during his term because he knows that such theoretical discussions do n't strike a chord among citizens , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is one of the few eu countries whose economy is doing well the eu expert added that blair instead would focus on " british pragmatism " during his term as eu president or in other words the liberalism versus protectionism debates .
emmanouilidis added that given britain 's healthy economy , blair naturally had the better arguments . the eu expert concluded that blair 's presidency would be marked , not so much by concrete things , but rather by lots of discussions .
" but controversial debates are also urgently needed , " emmanouildis said .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .
she needs to sell around 500 sausages a day .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .
she needs to sell around 500 sausages a day .

beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .
she needs to sell around 500 sausages a day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.06.2005 iraq seeks support at brussels conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multinational forces are still trying to restore stability more than 80 foreign ministers and officials began gathering in brussels ahead of a conference wednesday aimed at showing solidarity with violence-wracked iraq and to hear baghdad 's plans for rebuilding it . iraqi officials arrived in brussels tuesday hoping to lay out their plans for the country 's democratic development and convince the us , the eu and others to pony up the support they have promised . iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari , part of a 30-strong delegation headed by prime minister ibrahim jaafari , hopes the talks will support his government as it drafts a new constitution and prepares for elections later this year , reported afp . " the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .
during the us-eu summit , us president bush said he wanted the crisis-hit bloc to be a " strong " global partner .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- at summit , us has little room to gloat reconstruction in iraq and the situation in the middle east are on the official agenda for monday 's eu-us summit in washington .
but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion .
-lrb- june 20 , 2005 -rrb- nato leaders agree on iraq assistance in what was widely regarded as a largely symbolic pledge , us president george w. bush won support from his nato allies to assist in the training of iraqi security forces on tuesday .

during the us-eu summit , us president bush said he wanted the crisis-hit bloc to be a " strong " global partner . " the united states continues to support a strong european union as a partner in spreading freedom and democracy and security and prosperity throughout the world , " president george w. bush said after monday 's annual us-eu summit at the white house . bush spoke after meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the current eu president , european commission president jose manuel barroso and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . the european union is reeling after its failure to agree on a long-term budget and the postponement of plans to adopt a constitution after french and dutch voters crushingly rejected the charter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left : luxembourg 's prime minister and eu president juncker , bush and european commission president barroso in the white house " we made clear in our frank and open and friendly talks with the president that the european union is not -lrb- on -rrb- its knees , " said juncker , who has warned that the 25-nation bloc may see its global influence shrink . united stance on north korea , iran , lebanon in a series of joint statements , the united states and the european union declared a united front on issues like north korea 's nuclear weapons programs , iran 's atomic energy ambitions and recent elections in lebanon .

" once the lebanese government has defined its reform agenda and should it so request , we will consider convening an international conference to consolidate support for the lebanese people and the new government , " said a joint us-eu statement . in their joint statements , the two sides also reaffirmed their support for israel 's controversial plan to withdraw from the gaza strip and parts of the west bank and expressed strong support for palestinian elections . " we support the holding of free , fair , and transparent multi-party legislative elections in the west bank , gaza and east jerusalem , under the scrutiny of international observers and with full freedom of movement for candidates and voters , " they said . they also expressed " deep concern " about the human rights situation in zimbabwe and said they stood ready to provide help in the event of a dire food shortage there . moving past iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman enters a registration office for the elections in iraq in berlin in jan .
2005 both sides insisted that deep transatlantic divisions over the war in iraq were an issue of the past , with bush and juncker pointing to us-eu sponsorship of an international conference on iraqi reconstruction that is set to open in brussels on wednesday as evidence of overcoming disagreements . " there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward , there is a need for the world to work together so that iraq 's democracy will succeed , " said the us president . " when it comes to substance , when it comes to progress , when it comes to democracy , to freedom and to liberty , both the us and the european union are cooperating closely together and working in the same direction , " said juncker . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de quo vadis , europe ?

thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .

one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .
" it ’ s a tendency that has remained more or less stable over the past years . " tsunami the trigger stable it may be , but aid experts are clear that the tsunami last year threw the continuity of private aid off track .

" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .

" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.06.2005 young germans prove big spenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teenagers spend billions yearly on mobile phones germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .
but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .
" and the less kids there are , the more one invests in them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros . " saying no to spending is definitely out with kids , " said barlovic .

one recent study said that german youths have almost 23 billion euros at their disposal .
companies know that once they 've won over a teen , they 've probably won over the family .
-lrb- june 10 , 2005 -rrb- conservatism : the new rebellion ?
much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?
-lrb- may 27 , 2005 -rrb- " having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .

" the willingness to do something to help was enormous , " she recollected . elke s. ' response was repeated throughout the country .
thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .
" it ’ s a tendency that has remained more or less stable over the past years . " tsunami the trigger stable it may be , but aid experts are clear that the tsunami last year threw the continuity of private aid off track .
though final figures are n't out yet , the dzi forecasts that private donations for 2004 will easily surpass the normal yearly 2.3 - 2.4 billion euro benchmark for private charitable contributions . bildunterschrift : a thai fisherman walks through the tsunami destroyed village of ban nam khem , thailand . fundraisers are cautiously optimistic that the tsunami , which attracted several first-time donors , might lead to an increase in the private donor base in germany , which currently stands at about 40 percent of the 82-million-strong population . wilhelm heerman , an independent fundraiser who helped survey around 5,200 persons aged 18 to 70 across germany earlier this year on their charitable habits , said that almost 12 percent said they had donated during the tsunami for the first time .
" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history . " when you have difficulties coming to terms with your past and your roots are associated with trauma and pain then you automatically look for things to do that make sense , " said kuhl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.06.2005 young germans prove big spenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teenagers spend billions yearly on mobile phones germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .
but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .
" and the less kids there are , the more one invests in them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros . " saying no to spending is definitely out with kids , " said barlovic .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .
she needs to sell around 500 sausages a day .

but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .
" and the less kids there are , the more one invests in them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros . " saying no to spending is definitely out with kids , " said barlovic .

mexico have qualified from group b but brazil and japan face off on wednesday for the other spot .
germany manager jürgen klinsmann will be delighted to be two games from winning the trophy but will rue a glorious chance to end their miserable run against the big teams .
not since october 2000 have germany defeated a recognized top team when england fell 1-0 in the final game at wembley stadium .
" we 've come a long way , especially tactically , " said klinsmann about his young team after the match .
" that makes us more confident and each player able to believe that we can be a contender at this level .
i believe we 're on the right path . "
klinsmann chose to rest captain michael ballack , scorer of two penalties in the competition so far , with bernd schneider taking over the captain 's armband .
germany starts strong the hosts started the more promising but argentina should have scored in the 16th minute when carlos tevez crossed brilliantly from the right but luciano figueroa headed over .

a thomas hitzlsperger free-kick took a series of pinball deflections in the penalty area and the ball fell to kuranyi who prodded in .
but the lead lasted just three minutes as villareal star riquelme curled a delightful free-kick past timo hildebrand to restore parity .

the interval seemed to benefit germany and in the 51st minute they retook the lead through asamoah .
kuranyi saw the run of schalke star asamoah and the powerful front-man drilled a shot low into the corner .
the two teams met in dusseldorf back in february and germany twice led only to be pegged back late on at 2-2 .

11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , has left germany for morocco , his lawyer said tuesday .
abdelghani mzoudi , 32 , was acquitted last year of being an accessory to the sept .
11 murders and of belonging to a terrorist organization , but the court in hamburg specifically refused to rule him innocent , saying it was forced to acquit him because of lack of credible evidence . hamburg was a rear base to three of the suicide hijackers in the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington .
the federal court of justice confirmed the verdict on june 9 , and the state minister of the interior in hamburg gave mzoudi 14 days to leave the country after that date , saying that his presence had been tolerated only so long as there was a judicial case against him .
lawyer gul pinar said mzoudi had left for agadir in the company of another lawyer , michael rosenthal .
" we want to be absolutely sure what happens to him , " she said , adding that it was likely he would be interrogated by authorities in morocco , where his family has lined up legal counsel for him .
according to a german security expert , mzoudi risked being arrested and transferred to the us military camp in guantanamo bay , cuba , where al-qaeda and taliban suspects are held .
mzoudi , who studied electronics in hamburg , moved in the same circles as three of the sept .
11 hijackers .
he was only the second person anywhere in the world to face trial over the attacks .
the first , moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , is being re-tried in germany after his original guilty verdict was overturned .
both men had attended al-qaeda training camps in afghanistan . dw-world.de court upholds acquittal of terror suspect germany ’ s federal appeals court on thursday upheld a lower court 's acquittal of abdelghani mzoudi , who was accused of involvement in the sept .

the moves were part of a crackdown on foreign militants , made possible by newly tightened immigration laws . an egyptian and an afghan have been expelled from germany for suspected terrorist links and dozens of other deportations are pending , authorities in the southern state of bavaria said monday .
both men were sent to their respective home countries last week , the state interior ministry said in a statement .
it added that 15 other deportation notices had been served and a further 22 were being prepared .
' extremely dangerous ' it gave no details on the afghan case , because investigations were continuing .
the egyptian , omar yousif , was expelled for threatening german security and supporting a terrorist organizion , the ministry said .
the ministry said he had trained in pakistan at a camp of lashkar-e-taiba , an islamist group fighting against india in the disputed region of kashmir .
security authorities described yousif , who had been in detention since december , as " extremely dangerous and prepared to do violence . "
new laws make deportation easier german security services have tightened surveillance on islamist radicals since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
three of the suicide pilots in those attacks lived in hamburg .
as a result of a new immigration law that took effect jan .
1 , it is now easier to deport suspected foreign militants .
bavaria has been among the most aggressive states in applying the new law , with 12 alleged " extremists and hate preachers " removed since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister the two latest cases " show bavaria is continuing to take a tough line on islamist extremists and swiftly end their residence in germany , " said conservative state interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- .
if the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- win national elections expected in september - as they are widely expected to do - beckstein will likely be a candidate to run the federal interior ministry .
anti-immigration campaign platform in a statement that set off a wave of controversy , beckstein told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the cdu / csu would conduct its campaign in the coming elections on an anti-immigration platform .
voters have the choice between a policy of " massive immigration " if they vote for the social democrat-green party coalition , or one " without immigration , but with extensive family policies , life long work , and permanent further education . "
populist rhetoric ?
the comment unleashed loud resistance and accusations of using dangerously populist tactics , even from the cdu / csu allied free democrats .
the fdp spokesman for interior issues , max stadler , said the plan to base an election on immigration issues took a " populist approach " " nobody would be in favor of massive immigration to germany , " he told the dpa news agency , " that is an accusation that has nothing to do with reality and only serves to get your own followers riled up for the campaign . "
fdp steering committee member sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told handelsblatt on monday that the comments were " the most sickening kind of campaign rhetoric . "
and the head of the german institute for economic development -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , told the paper that such parries " corrupt the social climate .

but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .
" and the less kids there are , the more one invests in them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros . " saying no to spending is definitely out with kids , " said barlovic .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a soldier salutes the prosecution of 20 other suspects will be conducted separately .
the accused are believed to have mistreated 163 of their charges in the german army , or bundeswehr , during four exercises .
they used low-grade electrical shocks , punches and kicks .
the case made national headlines when it emerged last november .
still reeling germany 's armed forces are still smarting from the allegations .
at the time , it was alleged that several low-ranking officers mistreated bundeswehr recruits during basic training ; the perpetrators used methods that were said to be modeled on the us military torture of prisoners in abu ghraib , iraq .
bildunterschrift : recruits on the march but the issue turned out to be more widespread than anyone thought at first , with additional incidences of hazing coming to light as a result of follow-up investigations .
at the time , bundeswehr spokesman bernhard gertz said troops in coesfeld had been tortured with electrical shocks , had their noses held shut and water poured down their throats .
he cited members of the unit charged with the training the soldiers .
link to abu ghraib ?
" this incident is extremely upsetting because it soils the image of the bundeswehr , " gertz told the berliner zeitung newspaper in november .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .
she needs to sell around 500 sausages a day .

" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .
we 'll be the more relaxed team , that 's good .
we 'll make a few chances and we have to score - we know if we do n't we 'll be on the plane home .

" it 's an extremely special game for me .
when i hear the national anthem i 'll be very emotional but the minute it 's over i 'll be working for japan , " said the former brazil star . zico reported no injury concerns as he gave the players who did n't figure in sunday 's 1-0 win over greece a training session held in the searing afternoon heat at the viktoria football ground on the outskirts of cologne .
the stadium had seen better days with the japan squad looking a whole lot healthier than the decaying terraces which were overrun with weeds after losing their fight against nature . despite having an interpreter like his shadow by his side zico more often than not prefers to communicate his wishes visually rather than verbally , and his skills are paying off with japan the first team to qualify for the world cup . pressure normal for brazil , warns zico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assessing wednesday 's assignment the 52-year-old echoed kawaguchi 's thoughts saying : " brazil have all the pressure .
that may be good for japan , but then again the brazil players are used to coping with pressure . " reflecting on his work as japan coach he added : " what i 'm trying to do here is make the team more balanced , more powerful and organized . " mexico win shatters illusion of invincibility he inevitably declined to discuss tactics , but it wo n't have escaped his notice that mexico 's game plan of closing down the midfield , defending to the death and counter-attacking wherever possible seemed to work well enough in hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico has tried to impress on his team the importance of treating brazil not like football gods but like any other team .
" brazil have so many talented players , but so do i , " he explained .
" there 's not a lot of difference between teams today , everyone can beat anyone .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .
she needs to sell around 500 sausages a day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.06.2005 young germans prove big spenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german teenagers spend billions yearly on mobile phones germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .
but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .
" and the less kids there are , the more one invests in them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros . " saying no to spending is definitely out with kids , " said barlovic .
" if only the adults followed them -lrb- children and teenagers -rrb- , the economy could finally begin to look up . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mold them while they 're young teenagers have money - and lots of it .

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.06.2005 iraq seeks support at brussels conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multinational forces are still trying to restore stability more than 80 foreign ministers and officials began gathering in brussels ahead of a conference wednesday aimed at showing solidarity with violence-wracked iraq and to hear baghdad 's plans for rebuilding it . iraqi officials arrived in brussels tuesday hoping to lay out their plans for the country 's democratic development and convince the us , the eu and others to pony up the support they have promised . iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari , part of a 30-strong delegation headed by prime minister ibrahim jaafari , hopes the talks will support his government as it drafts a new constitution and prepares for elections later this year , reported afp . " the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .
during the us-eu summit , us president bush said he wanted the crisis-hit bloc to be a " strong " global partner .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- at summit , us has little room to gloat reconstruction in iraq and the situation in the middle east are on the official agenda for monday 's eu-us summit in washington .
but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion .
-lrb- june 20 , 2005 -rrb- nato leaders agree on iraq assistance in what was widely regarded as a largely symbolic pledge , us president george w. bush won support from his nato allies to assist in the training of iraqi security forces on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.06.2005 kids need a big scalp to convince doubters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are relishing the chance to get one over argentina germany 's young confed cup team are unbeaten in two games , scoring seven goals on the way to the semi-finals and yet , few are convinced of their credentials .
beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .
as it is , the top two face each other to see who wins the group and avoids the winner of group b in the last four . commentators have been loath to praise the germany team despite the two victories and seven goals which have put them on top of group a. many have accused them of lacking class and that the successes have not been convincing with a narrow 4-3 win against lowly australia and a late 3-0 defeat of tunisia . on closer inspection , this germany team is operating in a very traditional way and this confederations cup campaign is very similar to that of the 2002 world cup , a campaign which saw germany under-perform on their way to the final only to lose to a free-flowing , confident brazil team at the peak of its powers . parallels with world cup 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon during the 2002 world cup semi-final , june 25 , 2002 .
in japan / korea , germany struggled to overcome the likes of paraguay , the united states and south korea - all 1-0 wins - to make the final .
they thrashed saudi arabia 8-0 in their opening group game but drew 1-1 with the republic of ireland and managed a 2-0 win over cameroon .
there was very little in the way of real competition and germany , on the whole , struggled but still managed to reach the world cup final . but germany won the games that mattered in japan / korea and they are doing the same in the confederations cup where there are fewer games and fewer chances to get it right .
just as in the last world cup , germany have advanced with less than convincing performances but still find themselves in the last four of a major international tournament . big teams the biggest test for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and just as in 2002 , germany 's route to glory may very well be barred by one of the world 's best teams .
argentina will be the germans ' first real test of the tournament and there will be no complacency despite the fact both are through the group stages .
germany will want to beat argentina not just to get top spot and the chance to play the runners-up of group b -lrb- which could be brazil or japan -rrb- but to prove that they can win against the top teams in the world when it matters . argentina will feel empowered by mexico 's defeat of brazil and this will enhance their belief that they can win this trophy .
as the current in-form south american team , argentina will consider themselves favourites for the cup .
but they must first do away with germany .
the 2-2 draw in a friendly this year showed that the germans can raise their game but whether they can raise it enough to beat the argentineans remains to be seen . the match on thursday evening may be the dress rehearsal for the final if germany and argentina can overcome mexico , brazil or japan in the semi-finals .
a win for either side will give a psychological advantage to the victors . australia , tunisia playing for national pride bildunterschrift : in the other group a game , australia and tunisia will play it out for the pride factor of finishing third in the group after two defeats .
neither will want to return home after thursday night without any points on the board .
neither team can feel ashamed with their performances ; australia have taken both germany and argentina to the wire while tunisia have showed a flowing style of soccer that offers great potential for the future . however , it is a consolation game and the result will mean nothing in the context of the whole tournament .
this wo n't stop two proud teams going for it for themselves and the fans . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gets a break , then two more what a difference 15 minutes can make .

germany tied 2-2 with argentina on tuesday night , making the hosts the winner of confed cup group a. the result puts both teams through to the next round . germany still ca n't beat the big boys .
the tournament hosts twice surrender the lead after goals from brazilian-born striker kevin kuranyi -lrb- 29min -rrb- and gerald asamoah -lrb- 51 -rrb- saw germany forge ahead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand , center , watches the ball as argentina 's esteban cambiasso , unseen , scores his side 's second goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between germany and argentina in nuremberg , southern germany , tuesday , june 21 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / michael probst -rrb- but argentina twice replied through juan roman riquelme -lrb- 32 -rrb- and esteban cambiasso -lrb- 74 -rrb- to also qualify for the last four of the competition finishing as runners-up on goal difference - although neither team know their semi-final opponent .
mexico have qualified from group b but brazil and japan face off on wednesday for the other spot .
germany manager jürgen klinsmann will be delighted to be two games from winning the trophy but will rue a glorious chance to end their miserable run against the big teams .
not since october 2000 have germany defeated a recognized top team when england fell 1-0 in the final game at wembley stadium .
" we 've come a long way , especially tactically , " said klinsmann about his young team after the match .
" that makes us more confident and each player able to believe that we can be a contender at this level .
i believe we 're on the right path . "
klinsmann chose to rest captain michael ballack , scorer of two penalties in the competition so far , with bernd schneider taking over the captain 's armband .
germany starts strong the hosts started the more promising but argentina should have scored in the 16th minute when carlos tevez crossed brilliantly from the right but luciano figueroa headed over .
argentina then had a controlled spell of possession but gave the ball away cheaply at the back and were made to pay in the 29th minute .
a thomas hitzlsperger free-kick took a series of pinball deflections in the penalty area and the ball fell to kuranyi who prodded in .
but the lead lasted just three minutes as villareal star riquelme curled a delightful free-kick past timo hildebrand to restore parity .

-lrb- ap photo / diether endlicher -rrb- hildebrand was making a rare start between the german posts but could do nothing about the exquisite strike .
the interval seemed to benefit germany and in the 51st minute they retook the lead through asamoah .
kuranyi saw the run of schalke star asamoah and the powerful front-man drilled a shot low into the corner .

" reflecting on his work as japan coach he added : " what i 'm trying to do here is make the team more balanced , more powerful and organized . " mexico win shatters illusion of invincibility he inevitably declined to discuss tactics , but it wo n't have escaped his notice that mexico 's game plan of closing down the midfield , defending to the death and counter-attacking wherever possible seemed to work well enough in hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico has tried to impress on his team the importance of treating brazil not like football gods but like any other team .
" brazil have so many talented players , but so do i , " he explained .
" there 's not a lot of difference between teams today , everyone can beat anyone .
okay brazil are a great team , but they can be beaten - we 've got to go out and win . " zico and his players will hope to do just that .

" the willingness to do something to help was enormous , " she recollected . elke s. ' response was repeated throughout the country .
thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .
" it ’ s a tendency that has remained more or less stable over the past years . " tsunami the trigger stable it may be , but aid experts are clear that the tsunami last year threw the continuity of private aid off track .
though final figures are n't out yet , the dzi forecasts that private donations for 2004 will easily surpass the normal yearly 2.3 - 2.4 billion euro benchmark for private charitable contributions . bildunterschrift : a thai fisherman walks through the tsunami destroyed village of ban nam khem , thailand . fundraisers are cautiously optimistic that the tsunami , which attracted several first-time donors , might lead to an increase in the private donor base in germany , which currently stands at about 40 percent of the 82-million-strong population . wilhelm heerman , an independent fundraiser who helped survey around 5,200 persons aged 18 to 70 across germany earlier this year on their charitable habits , said that almost 12 percent said they had donated during the tsunami for the first time .
" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history . " when you have difficulties coming to terms with your past and your roots are associated with trauma and pain then you automatically look for things to do that make sense , " said kuhl .

private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .

one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .

" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .

the moves were part of a crackdown on foreign militants , made possible by newly tightened immigration laws . an egyptian and an afghan have been expelled from germany for suspected terrorist links and dozens of other deportations are pending , authorities in the southern state of bavaria said monday .
both men were sent to their respective home countries last week , the state interior ministry said in a statement .

' extremely dangerous ' it gave no details on the afghan case , because investigations were continuing .
the egyptian , omar yousif , was expelled for threatening german security and supporting a terrorist organizion , the ministry said .
the ministry said he had trained in pakistan at a camp of lashkar-e-taiba , an islamist group fighting against india in the disputed region of kashmir .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .
she needs to sell around 500 sausages a day .
considering the expansive nature of waistlines in berlin , that likely wo n't be a problem . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans do n't do low-carb while the latest diet craze makes its way through the us , germans continue chomping down on bread and potatoes .

but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros . " saying no to spending is definitely out with kids , " said barlovic .

but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .
" and the less kids there are , the more one invests in them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros .

beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .
as it is , the top two face each other to see who wins the group and avoids the winner of group b in the last four . commentators have been loath to praise the germany team despite the two victories and seven goals which have put them on top of group a. many have accused them of lacking class and that the successes have not been convincing with a narrow 4-3 win against lowly australia and a late 3-0 defeat of tunisia . on closer inspection , this germany team is operating in a very traditional way and this confederations cup campaign is very similar to that of the 2002 world cup , a campaign which saw germany under-perform on their way to the final only to lose to a free-flowing , confident brazil team at the peak of its powers . parallels with world cup 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon during the 2002 world cup semi-final , june 25 , 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.06.2005 iraq seeks support at brussels conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multinational forces are still trying to restore stability more than 80 foreign ministers and officials began gathering in brussels ahead of a conference wednesday aimed at showing solidarity with violence-wracked iraq and to hear baghdad 's plans for rebuilding it . iraqi officials arrived in brussels tuesday hoping to lay out their plans for the country 's democratic development and convince the us , the eu and others to pony up the support they have promised . iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari , part of a 30-strong delegation headed by prime minister ibrahim jaafari , hopes the talks will support his government as it drafts a new constitution and prepares for elections later this year , reported afp . " the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .
during the us-eu summit , us president bush said he wanted the crisis-hit bloc to be a " strong " global partner .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- at summit , us has little room to gloat reconstruction in iraq and the situation in the middle east are on the official agenda for monday 's eu-us summit in washington .
but the eu 's current crisis is bound to come up for discussion .
-lrb- june 20 , 2005 -rrb- nato leaders agree on iraq assistance in what was widely regarded as a largely symbolic pledge , us president george w. bush won support from his nato allies to assist in the training of iraqi security forces on tuesday .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .

" there is a special european social model to protect that has developed on the continent , " said schröder , who will likely be facing early elections in september .
" through the integration of europe , the common market and later the common currency , we have been able to overcome the forms of nationalism that brought our continent so much suffering , " he said . " those who want to destroy this model due to national egotism or populist motives do a terrible disservice to the desires and rights of the next generation . " " leveling europe to a pure market " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder in happier times schröder , who was speaking at a book presentation in berlin , said europe was faced with an identity crisis that went far deeper than differences over financing or the constitution . " at its heart , it is about the question , which europe do we want ? " he said . " do we want a single europe that it able to take action , a true political union as is foreseen in the constitution ?
or do we want a big free-trade union , do we want to go from the european union back to the european economic community ? " he said there was no doubt europe needed a political union and warned against " leveling -lrb- europe -rrb- down to a pure market . " over the weekend in brussels , schröder blamed the " inflexible " stance of blair for the breakdown of eu budget negotiations for 2007 - 2013 , saying blair 's steadfast refusal to back down on britain 's long-cherished eu rebate worth around 4.6 billion euros yearly killed any possible deal . since then other european leaders such as luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , have joined the chorus in accusing blair of trying to reduce the bloc to little more than a free-trade zone . britain takes on eu presidency amid crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels ' generous farm subsidies are a sticking point in the current crisis engulfing the eu blair has dug in his heels and refused to give up the controversial rebate until eu leaders decide to overhaul and reform farm subsidies which swallow some 40 percent of the eu budget . on monday , blair reiterated his stance during a speech to the house of commons in london , saying : " it was not the right concept for great britain and it was not the right concept for europe . " the acrimony comes at a time when blair is preparing to take over the six-month rotating eu presidency on july 1 and is expected to pour oil on troubled waters .
blair , who is due to deliver a speech to the european parliament on thursday about his vision for europe and his plans for the next six months , said tuesday he thought a deal could be reached this time . " we see our role in presidency in part as also trying to launch that debate , and do it in a constructive way , do it in a way that 's open to the views of others and tries to get some form of consensus as to how we move forward , " blair said . british pragmatism but no deal on budget but experts remain skeptical . janis emmanouilidis , expert on the eu at the center for applied policy research in munich said it was doubtful that a deal on eu finances could be reached during blair 's presidency . emmanouilidis said the row over money had exposed two diametrically opposite political directions within the bloc : while schröder , chirac and juncker see the eu as a visionary social model and not just as a politically enriched trade zone , blair was treading in the neoliberal footsteps of former british prime minister margaret thatcher . " but blair wo n't initiate this debate during his term because he knows that such theoretical discussions do n't strike a chord among citizens , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is one of the few eu countries whose economy is doing well the eu expert added that blair instead would focus on " british pragmatism " during his term as eu president or in other words the liberalism versus protectionism debates .
emmanouilidis added that given britain 's healthy economy , blair naturally had the better arguments . the eu expert concluded that blair 's presidency would be marked , not so much by concrete things , but rather by lots of discussions .
" but controversial debates are also urgently needed , " emmanouildis said .

the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .

germany will want to beat argentina not just to get top spot and the chance to play the runners-up of group b -lrb- which could be brazil or japan -rrb- but to prove that they can win against the top teams in the world when it matters . argentina will feel empowered by mexico 's defeat of brazil and this will enhance their belief that they can win this trophy .
as the current in-form south american team , argentina will consider themselves favourites for the cup .
but they must first do away with germany .
the 2-2 draw in a friendly this year showed that the germans can raise their game but whether they can raise it enough to beat the argentineans remains to be seen . the match on thursday evening may be the dress rehearsal for the final if germany and argentina can overcome mexico , brazil or japan in the semi-finals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.06.2005 kids need a big scalp to convince doubters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are relishing the chance to get one over argentina germany 's young confed cup team are unbeaten in two games , scoring seven goals on the way to the semi-finals and yet , few are convinced of their credentials .
beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .
as it is , the top two face each other to see who wins the group and avoids the winner of group b in the last four . commentators have been loath to praise the germany team despite the two victories and seven goals which have put them on top of group a. many have accused them of lacking class and that the successes have not been convincing with a narrow 4-3 win against lowly australia and a late 3-0 defeat of tunisia . on closer inspection , this germany team is operating in a very traditional way and this confederations cup campaign is very similar to that of the 2002 world cup , a campaign which saw germany under-perform on their way to the final only to lose to a free-flowing , confident brazil team at the peak of its powers . parallels with world cup 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon during the 2002 world cup semi-final , june 25 , 2002 .
in japan / korea , germany struggled to overcome the likes of paraguay , the united states and south korea - all 1-0 wins - to make the final .
they thrashed saudi arabia 8-0 in their opening group game but drew 1-1 with the republic of ireland and managed a 2-0 win over cameroon .
there was very little in the way of real competition and germany , on the whole , struggled but still managed to reach the world cup final . but germany won the games that mattered in japan / korea and they are doing the same in the confederations cup where there are fewer games and fewer chances to get it right .
just as in the last world cup , germany have advanced with less than convincing performances but still find themselves in the last four of a major international tournament . big teams the biggest test for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and just as in 2002 , germany 's route to glory may very well be barred by one of the world 's best teams .
argentina will be the germans ' first real test of the tournament and there will be no complacency despite the fact both are through the group stages .
germany will want to beat argentina not just to get top spot and the chance to play the runners-up of group b -lrb- which could be brazil or japan -rrb- but to prove that they can win against the top teams in the world when it matters . argentina will feel empowered by mexico 's defeat of brazil and this will enhance their belief that they can win this trophy .
as the current in-form south american team , argentina will consider themselves favourites for the cup .
but they must first do away with germany .
the 2-2 draw in a friendly this year showed that the germans can raise their game but whether they can raise it enough to beat the argentineans remains to be seen . the match on thursday evening may be the dress rehearsal for the final if germany and argentina can overcome mexico , brazil or japan in the semi-finals .
a win for either side will give a psychological advantage to the victors . australia , tunisia playing for national pride bildunterschrift : in the other group a game , australia and tunisia will play it out for the pride factor of finishing third in the group after two defeats .
neither will want to return home after thursday night without any points on the board .
neither team can feel ashamed with their performances ; australia have taken both germany and argentina to the wire while tunisia have showed a flowing style of soccer that offers great potential for the future . however , it is a consolation game and the result will mean nothing in the context of the whole tournament .

they donated in record numbers after the asian tsunami six months ago . when television images of the devastating tsunami in southeast asia entered living rooms on dec .
26 2004 , elke s. ' -lrb- who wished to remain anonymous -rrb- first thought was : ' how can i help ? ' the 61-year-old from worms in southern germany got together with fellow members of the national union of german housewives ' associations , a nationwide organization involved in charitable causes , collected 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,180 -rrb- and handed it to an aid group heading to sri lanka . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german red cross volunteers stock up on aid supplies for tsunami victims elke s. remembers the entire town being mobilized as charity shows and collection boxes turned up at every street corner .
" the willingness to do something to help was enormous , " she recollected . elke s. ' response was repeated throughout the country .
thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .
" it ’ s a tendency that has remained more or less stable over the past years . " tsunami the trigger stable it may be , but aid experts are clear that the tsunami last year threw the continuity of private aid off track .
though final figures are n't out yet , the dzi forecasts that private donations for 2004 will easily surpass the normal yearly 2.3 - 2.4 billion euro benchmark for private charitable contributions . bildunterschrift : a thai fisherman walks through the tsunami destroyed village of ban nam khem , thailand . fundraisers are cautiously optimistic that the tsunami , which attracted several first-time donors , might lead to an increase in the private donor base in germany , which currently stands at about 40 percent of the 82-million-strong population . wilhelm heerman , an independent fundraiser who helped survey around 5,200 persons aged 18 to 70 across germany earlier this year on their charitable habits , said that almost 12 percent said they had donated during the tsunami for the first time .
" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history . " when you have difficulties coming to terms with your past and your roots are associated with trauma and pain then you automatically look for things to do that make sense , " said kuhl . " helping others in need often makes you feel stronger and more positive about yourself .

" the willingness to do something to help was enormous , " she recollected . elke s. ' response was repeated throughout the country .
thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .
" it ’ s a tendency that has remained more or less stable over the past years . " tsunami the trigger stable it may be , but aid experts are clear that the tsunami last year threw the continuity of private aid off track .
though final figures are n't out yet , the dzi forecasts that private donations for 2004 will easily surpass the normal yearly 2.3 - 2.4 billion euro benchmark for private charitable contributions . bildunterschrift : a thai fisherman walks through the tsunami destroyed village of ban nam khem , thailand . fundraisers are cautiously optimistic that the tsunami , which attracted several first-time donors , might lead to an increase in the private donor base in germany , which currently stands at about 40 percent of the 82-million-strong population . wilhelm heerman , an independent fundraiser who helped survey around 5,200 persons aged 18 to 70 across germany earlier this year on their charitable habits , said that almost 12 percent said they had donated during the tsunami for the first time .
" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history . " when you have difficulties coming to terms with your past and your roots are associated with trauma and pain then you automatically look for things to do that make sense , " said kuhl .

though final figures are n't out yet , the dzi forecasts that private donations for 2004 will easily surpass the normal yearly 2.3 - 2.4 billion euro benchmark for private charitable contributions . bildunterschrift : a thai fisherman walks through the tsunami destroyed village of ban nam khem , thailand . fundraisers are cautiously optimistic that the tsunami , which attracted several first-time donors , might lead to an increase in the private donor base in germany , which currently stands at about 40 percent of the 82-million-strong population . wilhelm heerman , an independent fundraiser who helped survey around 5,200 persons aged 18 to 70 across germany earlier this year on their charitable habits , said that almost 12 percent said they had donated during the tsunami for the first time .
" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history .

" the willingness to do something to help was enormous , " she recollected . elke s. ' response was repeated throughout the country .
thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .

" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .
we 'll be the more relaxed team , that 's good .
we 'll make a few chances and we have to score - we know if we do n't we 'll be on the plane home . " brazilian legend plots downfall of home nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico for zico the stakes do n't come much higher for while this competition is no world cup wednesday 's game pits him against his country of birth for the first time since taking over from philippe troussier as japan coach . " it 's an extremely special game for me .
when i hear the national anthem i 'll be very emotional but the minute it 's over i 'll be working for japan , " said the former brazil star . zico reported no injury concerns as he gave the players who did n't figure in sunday 's 1-0 win over greece a training session held in the searing afternoon heat at the viktoria football ground on the outskirts of cologne .
the stadium had seen better days with the japan squad looking a whole lot healthier than the decaying terraces which were overrun with weeds after losing their fight against nature . despite having an interpreter like his shadow by his side zico more often than not prefers to communicate his wishes visually rather than verbally , and his skills are paying off with japan the first team to qualify for the world cup . pressure normal for brazil , warns zico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assessing wednesday 's assignment the 52-year-old echoed kawaguchi 's thoughts saying : " brazil have all the pressure .
that may be good for japan , but then again the brazil players are used to coping with pressure . " reflecting on his work as japan coach he added : " what i 'm trying to do here is make the team more balanced , more powerful and organized . " mexico win shatters illusion of invincibility he inevitably declined to discuss tactics , but it wo n't have escaped his notice that mexico 's game plan of closing down the midfield , defending to the death and counter-attacking wherever possible seemed to work well enough in hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico has tried to impress on his team the importance of treating brazil not like football gods but like any other team .
" brazil have so many talented players , but so do i , " he explained .
" there 's not a lot of difference between teams today , everyone can beat anyone .
okay brazil are a great team , but they can be beaten - we 've got to go out and win . " zico and his players will hope to do just that .

but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .
" and the less kids there are , the more one invests in them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday .

baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .

iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .

" there is a special european social model to protect that has developed on the continent , " said schröder , who will likely be facing early elections in september .
" through the integration of europe , the common market and later the common currency , we have been able to overcome the forms of nationalism that brought our continent so much suffering , " he said . " those who want to destroy this model due to national egotism or populist motives do a terrible disservice to the desires and rights of the next generation . " " leveling europe to a pure market " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder in happier times schröder , who was speaking at a book presentation in berlin , said europe was faced with an identity crisis that went far deeper than differences over financing or the constitution . " at its heart , it is about the question , which europe do we want ? " he said . " do we want a single europe that it able to take action , a true political union as is foreseen in the constitution ?
or do we want a big free-trade union , do we want to go from the european union back to the european economic community ? " he said there was no doubt europe needed a political union and warned against " leveling -lrb- europe -rrb- down to a pure market . " over the weekend in brussels , schröder blamed the " inflexible " stance of blair for the breakdown of eu budget negotiations for 2007 - 2013 , saying blair 's steadfast refusal to back down on britain 's long-cherished eu rebate worth around 4.6 billion euros yearly killed any possible deal . since then other european leaders such as luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , have joined the chorus in accusing blair of trying to reduce the bloc to little more than a free-trade zone . britain takes on eu presidency amid crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels ' generous farm subsidies are a sticking point in the current crisis engulfing the eu blair has dug in his heels and refused to give up the controversial rebate until eu leaders decide to overhaul and reform farm subsidies which swallow some 40 percent of the eu budget . on monday , blair reiterated his stance during a speech to the house of commons in london , saying : " it was not the right concept for great britain and it was not the right concept for europe . " the acrimony comes at a time when blair is preparing to take over the six-month rotating eu presidency on july 1 and is expected to pour oil on troubled waters .
blair , who is due to deliver a speech to the european parliament on thursday about his vision for europe and his plans for the next six months , said tuesday he thought a deal could be reached this time . " we see our role in presidency in part as also trying to launch that debate , and do it in a constructive way , do it in a way that 's open to the views of others and tries to get some form of consensus as to how we move forward , " blair said . british pragmatism but no deal on budget but experts remain skeptical . janis emmanouilidis , expert on the eu at the center for applied policy research in munich said it was doubtful that a deal on eu finances could be reached during blair 's presidency . emmanouilidis said the row over money had exposed two diametrically opposite political directions within the bloc : while schröder , chirac and juncker see the eu as a visionary social model and not just as a politically enriched trade zone , blair was treading in the neoliberal footsteps of former british prime minister margaret thatcher . " but blair wo n't initiate this debate during his term because he knows that such theoretical discussions do n't strike a chord among citizens , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is one of the few eu countries whose economy is doing well the eu expert added that blair instead would focus on " british pragmatism " during his term as eu president or in other words the liberalism versus protectionism debates .
emmanouilidis added that given britain 's healthy economy , blair naturally had the better arguments . the eu expert concluded that blair 's presidency would be marked , not so much by concrete things , but rather by lots of discussions .
" but controversial debates are also urgently needed , " emmanouildis said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.06.2005 giving even when it hurts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collection boxes in germany were full in the aftermath of the tsunami germans may be hard hit by their struggling economy , but they do n't cut corners when it comes to charitable giving .
they donated in record numbers after the asian tsunami six months ago . when television images of the devastating tsunami in southeast asia entered living rooms on dec .
26 2004 , elke s. ' -lrb- who wished to remain anonymous -rrb- first thought was : ' how can i help ? ' the 61-year-old from worms in southern germany got together with fellow members of the national union of german housewives ' associations , a nationwide organization involved in charitable causes , collected 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,180 -rrb- and handed it to an aid group heading to sri lanka . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german red cross volunteers stock up on aid supplies for tsunami victims elke s. remembers the entire town being mobilized as charity shows and collection boxes turned up at every street corner .
" the willingness to do something to help was enormous , " she recollected . elke s. ' response was repeated throughout the country .
thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .

thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .
" it ’ s a tendency that has remained more or less stable over the past years . " tsunami the trigger stable it may be , but aid experts are clear that the tsunami last year threw the continuity of private aid off track .
though final figures are n't out yet , the dzi forecasts that private donations for 2004 will easily surpass the normal yearly 2.3 - 2.4 billion euro benchmark for private charitable contributions . bildunterschrift : a thai fisherman walks through the tsunami destroyed village of ban nam khem , thailand . fundraisers are cautiously optimistic that the tsunami , which attracted several first-time donors , might lead to an increase in the private donor base in germany , which currently stands at about 40 percent of the 82-million-strong population . wilhelm heerman , an independent fundraiser who helped survey around 5,200 persons aged 18 to 70 across germany earlier this year on their charitable habits , said that almost 12 percent said they had donated during the tsunami for the first time .
" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history . " when you have difficulties coming to terms with your past and your roots are associated with trauma and pain then you automatically look for things to do that make sense , " said kuhl .

" once the lebanese government has defined its reform agenda and should it so request , we will consider convening an international conference to consolidate support for the lebanese people and the new government , " said a joint us-eu statement . in their joint statements , the two sides also reaffirmed their support for israel 's controversial plan to withdraw from the gaza strip and parts of the west bank and expressed strong support for palestinian elections . " we support the holding of free , fair , and transparent multi-party legislative elections in the west bank , gaza and east jerusalem , under the scrutiny of international observers and with full freedom of movement for candidates and voters , " they said . they also expressed " deep concern " about the human rights situation in zimbabwe and said they stood ready to provide help in the event of a dire food shortage there . moving past iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman enters a registration office for the elections in iraq in berlin in jan .

11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , has left germany for morocco , his lawyer said tuesday .
abdelghani mzoudi , 32 , was acquitted last year of being an accessory to the sept .
11 murders and of belonging to a terrorist organization , but the court in hamburg specifically refused to rule him innocent , saying it was forced to acquit him because of lack of credible evidence . hamburg was a rear base to three of the suicide hijackers in the sept .
11 attacks on new york and washington .
the federal court of justice confirmed the verdict on june 9 , and the state minister of the interior in hamburg gave mzoudi 14 days to leave the country after that date , saying that his presence had been tolerated only so long as there was a judicial case against him .
lawyer gul pinar said mzoudi had left for agadir in the company of another lawyer , michael rosenthal .
" we want to be absolutely sure what happens to him , " she said , adding that it was likely he would be interrogated by authorities in morocco , where his family has lined up legal counsel for him .
according to a german security expert , mzoudi risked being arrested and transferred to the us military camp in guantanamo bay , cuba , where al-qaeda and taliban suspects are held .
mzoudi , who studied electronics in hamburg , moved in the same circles as three of the sept .
11 hijackers .
he was only the second person anywhere in the world to face trial over the attacks .
the first , moroccan student mounir el motassadeq , is being re-tried in germany after his original guilty verdict was overturned .
both men had attended al-qaeda training camps in afghanistan . dw-world.de court upholds acquittal of terror suspect germany ’ s federal appeals court on thursday upheld a lower court 's acquittal of abdelghani mzoudi , who was accused of involvement in the sept .

both men were sent to their respective home countries last week , the state interior ministry said in a statement .
it added that 15 other deportation notices had been served and a further 22 were being prepared .
' extremely dangerous ' it gave no details on the afghan case , because investigations were continuing .
the egyptian , omar yousif , was expelled for threatening german security and supporting a terrorist organizion , the ministry said .
the ministry said he had trained in pakistan at a camp of lashkar-e-taiba , an islamist group fighting against india in the disputed region of kashmir .

anti-immigration campaign platform in a statement that set off a wave of controversy , beckstein told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the cdu / csu would conduct its campaign in the coming elections on an anti-immigration platform .
voters have the choice between a policy of " massive immigration " if they vote for the social democrat-green party coalition , or one " without immigration , but with extensive family policies , life long work , and permanent further education . "
populist rhetoric ?
the comment unleashed loud resistance and accusations of using dangerously populist tactics , even from the cdu / csu allied free democrats .
the fdp spokesman for interior issues , max stadler , said the plan to base an election on immigration issues took a " populist approach " " nobody would be in favor of massive immigration to germany , " he told the dpa news agency , " that is an accusation that has nothing to do with reality and only serves to get your own followers riled up for the campaign . "
fdp steering committee member sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told handelsblatt on monday that the comments were " the most sickening kind of campaign rhetoric . "

but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .
" children are increasingly becoming a rare commodity , " ingo barlovic , who headed the study , told german news agency dpa .
" and the less kids there are , the more one invests in them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 percent of all children up to the age of 14 are said to be poor in germany barlovic underlined that the children were very clearly disconnected from the present tough economic situations of adults in germany .
at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros . " saying no to spending is definitely out with kids , " said barlovic .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal .

the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.06.2005 kids need a big scalp to convince doubters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are relishing the chance to get one over argentina germany 's young confed cup team are unbeaten in two games , scoring seven goals on the way to the semi-finals and yet , few are convinced of their credentials .
beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .
as it is , the top two face each other to see who wins the group and avoids the winner of group b in the last four . commentators have been loath to praise the germany team despite the two victories and seven goals which have put them on top of group a. many have accused them of lacking class and that the successes have not been convincing with a narrow 4-3 win against lowly australia and a late 3-0 defeat of tunisia . on closer inspection , this germany team is operating in a very traditional way and this confederations cup campaign is very similar to that of the 2002 world cup , a campaign which saw germany under-perform on their way to the final only to lose to a free-flowing , confident brazil team at the peak of its powers . parallels with world cup 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon during the 2002 world cup semi-final , june 25 , 2002 .
in japan / korea , germany struggled to overcome the likes of paraguay , the united states and south korea - all 1-0 wins - to make the final .
they thrashed saudi arabia 8-0 in their opening group game but drew 1-1 with the republic of ireland and managed a 2-0 win over cameroon .
there was very little in the way of real competition and germany , on the whole , struggled but still managed to reach the world cup final . but germany won the games that mattered in japan / korea and they are doing the same in the confederations cup where there are fewer games and fewer chances to get it right .
just as in the last world cup , germany have advanced with less than convincing performances but still find themselves in the last four of a major international tournament . big teams the biggest test for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and just as in 2002 , germany 's route to glory may very well be barred by one of the world 's best teams .
argentina will be the germans ' first real test of the tournament and there will be no complacency despite the fact both are through the group stages .
germany will want to beat argentina not just to get top spot and the chance to play the runners-up of group b -lrb- which could be brazil or japan -rrb- but to prove that they can win against the top teams in the world when it matters . argentina will feel empowered by mexico 's defeat of brazil and this will enhance their belief that they can win this trophy .
as the current in-form south american team , argentina will consider themselves favourites for the cup .
but they must first do away with germany .
the 2-2 draw in a friendly this year showed that the germans can raise their game but whether they can raise it enough to beat the argentineans remains to be seen . the match on thursday evening may be the dress rehearsal for the final if germany and argentina can overcome mexico , brazil or japan in the semi-finals .
a win for either side will give a psychological advantage to the victors . australia , tunisia playing for national pride bildunterschrift : in the other group a game , australia and tunisia will play it out for the pride factor of finishing third in the group after two defeats .
neither will want to return home after thursday night without any points on the board .
neither team can feel ashamed with their performances ; australia have taken both germany and argentina to the wire while tunisia have showed a flowing style of soccer that offers great potential for the future . however , it is a consolation game and the result will mean nothing in the context of the whole tournament .
this wo n't stop two proud teams going for it for themselves and the fans . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gets a break , then two more what a difference 15 minutes can make .
germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 .
-lrb- june 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .
everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem .
-lrb- june 15 , 2005 -rrb- argentina bounces roos argentina 's luciano figueroa single-handedly dismantled the socceroos of australia , scoring a hat-trick .
with their 4-2 victory , jose pekerman 's squad did not impress the small crowd in nuremberg .

beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .
as it is , the top two face each other to see who wins the group and avoids the winner of group b in the last four . commentators have been loath to praise the germany team despite the two victories and seven goals which have put them on top of group a. many have accused them of lacking class and that the successes have not been convincing with a narrow 4-3 win against lowly australia and a late 3-0 defeat of tunisia . on closer inspection , this germany team is operating in a very traditional way and this confederations cup campaign is very similar to that of the 2002 world cup , a campaign which saw germany under-perform on their way to the final only to lose to a free-flowing , confident brazil team at the peak of its powers . parallels with world cup 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon during the 2002 world cup semi-final , june 25 , 2002 .
in japan / korea , germany struggled to overcome the likes of paraguay , the united states and south korea - all 1-0 wins - to make the final .
they thrashed saudi arabia 8-0 in their opening group game but drew 1-1 with the republic of ireland and managed a 2-0 win over cameroon .
there was very little in the way of real competition and germany , on the whole , struggled but still managed to reach the world cup final . but germany won the games that mattered in japan / korea and they are doing the same in the confederations cup where there are fewer games and fewer chances to get it right .
just as in the last world cup , germany have advanced with less than convincing performances but still find themselves in the last four of a major international tournament . big teams the biggest test for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and just as in 2002 , germany 's route to glory may very well be barred by one of the world 's best teams .
argentina will be the germans ' first real test of the tournament and there will be no complacency despite the fact both are through the group stages .
germany will want to beat argentina not just to get top spot and the chance to play the runners-up of group b -lrb- which could be brazil or japan -rrb- but to prove that they can win against the top teams in the world when it matters . argentina will feel empowered by mexico 's defeat of brazil and this will enhance their belief that they can win this trophy .
as the current in-form south american team , argentina will consider themselves favourites for the cup .
but they must first do away with germany .
the 2-2 draw in a friendly this year showed that the germans can raise their game but whether they can raise it enough to beat the argentineans remains to be seen . the match on thursday evening may be the dress rehearsal for the final if germany and argentina can overcome mexico , brazil or japan in the semi-finals .
a win for either side will give a psychological advantage to the victors . australia , tunisia playing for national pride bildunterschrift : in the other group a game , australia and tunisia will play it out for the pride factor of finishing third in the group after two defeats .
neither will want to return home after thursday night without any points on the board .
neither team can feel ashamed with their performances ; australia have taken both germany and argentina to the wire while tunisia have showed a flowing style of soccer that offers great potential for the future . however , it is a consolation game and the result will mean nothing in the context of the whole tournament .
this wo n't stop two proud teams going for it for themselves and the fans . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gets a break , then two more what a difference 15 minutes can make .
germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 .
-lrb- june 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .
everyone was pleased with bringing home the three points but the porous defense is turning into a serious problem .
-lrb- june 15 , 2005 -rrb- argentina bounces roos argentina 's luciano figueroa single-handedly dismantled the socceroos of australia , scoring a hat-trick .
with their 4-2 victory , jose pekerman 's squad did not impress the small crowd in nuremberg .
-lrb- june 18 , 2005 -rrb- argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories . a near stagnant economy , high unemployment and cuts in social benefits might be spurring german adults to keep a firm grip on their purse strings when it comes to shopping or eating out .
but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .
this year , that amounts to 19 billion euros - 600 million euros more than 2004 . researchers point out that the study results appeared all the more stunning given that the age group between 6 and 19 years had shrunk by 110,000 to 12.11 million in 2005 due to demographic changes in the country .

at the same time , he added it would be wrong to conclude that the financial situation of all children and teenagers in the country was rosy because the study worked with average values and did n't particularly highlight the problem of child poverty . researchers also point out that the study shows that 10 percent of 10- to 14-year-olds did n't receive regular pocket money - thus creating a clear division between the haves and the have-nots . adults should spoil themselves average incomes of children and teenagers between 6 and 19 years are also rising , according to the study .
in 2005 , the per-head income reached 1,570 euros - 60 euros more than the previous year . parents too are n't holding back when it comes to satisfying their children 's needs - 4.7 billion euros alone flow as regular pocket money on the age group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids are usually showered with presents during christmas furthermore , there are a string of additional income sources such as unplanned gifts by parents , money from part-time jobs for those already working and , most importantly , financial presents from family during christmas and on birthdays .
the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past . " it 's a very good opportunity for iraq to put its case to the international community , and in turn it 's a good opportunity for the international community to show that it 's united , " he told afp . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush seeks " strong " europe it may be riddled by internal divisions , but the eu can count on support from its most important ally .

" there is a special european social model to protect that has developed on the continent , " said schröder , who will likely be facing early elections in september .
" through the integration of europe , the common market and later the common currency , we have been able to overcome the forms of nationalism that brought our continent so much suffering , " he said . " those who want to destroy this model due to national egotism or populist motives do a terrible disservice to the desires and rights of the next generation . " " leveling europe to a pure market " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder in happier times schröder , who was speaking at a book presentation in berlin , said europe was faced with an identity crisis that went far deeper than differences over financing or the constitution . " at its heart , it is about the question , which europe do we want ? " he said . " do we want a single europe that it able to take action , a true political union as is foreseen in the constitution ?
or do we want a big free-trade union , do we want to go from the european union back to the european economic community ? " he said there was no doubt europe needed a political union and warned against " leveling -lrb- europe -rrb- down to a pure market . " over the weekend in brussels , schröder blamed the " inflexible " stance of blair for the breakdown of eu budget negotiations for 2007 - 2013 , saying blair 's steadfast refusal to back down on britain 's long-cherished eu rebate worth around 4.6 billion euros yearly killed any possible deal . since then other european leaders such as luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , have joined the chorus in accusing blair of trying to reduce the bloc to little more than a free-trade zone . britain takes on eu presidency amid crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels ' generous farm subsidies are a sticking point in the current crisis engulfing the eu blair has dug in his heels and refused to give up the controversial rebate until eu leaders decide to overhaul and reform farm subsidies which swallow some 40 percent of the eu budget . on monday , blair reiterated his stance during a speech to the house of commons in london , saying : " it was not the right concept for great britain and it was not the right concept for europe . " the acrimony comes at a time when blair is preparing to take over the six-month rotating eu presidency on july 1 and is expected to pour oil on troubled waters .
blair , who is due to deliver a speech to the european parliament on thursday about his vision for europe and his plans for the next six months , said tuesday he thought a deal could be reached this time . " we see our role in presidency in part as also trying to launch that debate , and do it in a constructive way , do it in a way that 's open to the views of others and tries to get some form of consensus as to how we move forward , " blair said . british pragmatism but no deal on budget but experts remain skeptical . janis emmanouilidis , expert on the eu at the center for applied policy research in munich said it was doubtful that a deal on eu finances could be reached during blair 's presidency . emmanouilidis said the row over money had exposed two diametrically opposite political directions within the bloc : while schröder , chirac and juncker see the eu as a visionary social model and not just as a politically enriched trade zone , blair was treading in the neoliberal footsteps of former british prime minister margaret thatcher . " but blair wo n't initiate this debate during his term because he knows that such theoretical discussions do n't strike a chord among citizens , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain is one of the few eu countries whose economy is doing well the eu expert added that blair instead would focus on " british pragmatism " during his term as eu president or in other words the liberalism versus protectionism debates .
emmanouilidis added that given britain 's healthy economy , blair naturally had the better arguments . the eu expert concluded that blair 's presidency would be marked , not so much by concrete things , but rather by lots of discussions .
" but controversial debates are also urgently needed , " emmanouildis said .

" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .
we 'll be the more relaxed team , that 's good .
we 'll make a few chances and we have to score - we know if we do n't we 'll be on the plane home . " brazilian legend plots downfall of home nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico for zico the stakes do n't come much higher for while this competition is no world cup wednesday 's game pits him against his country of birth for the first time since taking over from philippe troussier as japan coach . " it 's an extremely special game for me .
when i hear the national anthem i 'll be very emotional but the minute it 's over i 'll be working for japan , " said the former brazil star . zico reported no injury concerns as he gave the players who did n't figure in sunday 's 1-0 win over greece a training session held in the searing afternoon heat at the viktoria football ground on the outskirts of cologne .
the stadium had seen better days with the japan squad looking a whole lot healthier than the decaying terraces which were overrun with weeds after losing their fight against nature . despite having an interpreter like his shadow by his side zico more often than not prefers to communicate his wishes visually rather than verbally , and his skills are paying off with japan the first team to qualify for the world cup . pressure normal for brazil , warns zico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assessing wednesday 's assignment the 52-year-old echoed kawaguchi 's thoughts saying : " brazil have all the pressure .
that may be good for japan , but then again the brazil players are used to coping with pressure . " reflecting on his work as japan coach he added : " what i 'm trying to do here is make the team more balanced , more powerful and organized . " mexico win shatters illusion of invincibility he inevitably declined to discuss tactics , but it wo n't have escaped his notice that mexico 's game plan of closing down the midfield , defending to the death and counter-attacking wherever possible seemed to work well enough in hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico has tried to impress on his team the importance of treating brazil not like football gods but like any other team .
" brazil have so many talented players , but so do i , " he explained .
" there 's not a lot of difference between teams today , everyone can beat anyone .
okay brazil are a great team , but they can be beaten - we 've got to go out and win . " zico and his players will hope to do just that .

" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .
we 'll be the more relaxed team , that 's good .
we 'll make a few chances and we have to score - we know if we do n't we 'll be on the plane home . " brazilian legend plots downfall of home nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico for zico the stakes do n't come much higher for while this competition is no world cup wednesday 's game pits him against his country of birth for the first time since taking over from philippe troussier as japan coach . " it 's an extremely special game for me .
when i hear the national anthem i 'll be very emotional but the minute it 's over i 'll be working for japan , " said the former brazil star . zico reported no injury concerns as he gave the players who did n't figure in sunday 's 1-0 win over greece a training session held in the searing afternoon heat at the viktoria football ground on the outskirts of cologne .
the stadium had seen better days with the japan squad looking a whole lot healthier than the decaying terraces which were overrun with weeds after losing their fight against nature . despite having an interpreter like his shadow by his side zico more often than not prefers to communicate his wishes visually rather than verbally , and his skills are paying off with japan the first team to qualify for the world cup . pressure normal for brazil , warns zico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assessing wednesday 's assignment the 52-year-old echoed kawaguchi 's thoughts saying : " brazil have all the pressure .
that may be good for japan , but then again the brazil players are used to coping with pressure . " reflecting on his work as japan coach he added : " what i 'm trying to do here is make the team more balanced , more powerful and organized . " mexico win shatters illusion of invincibility he inevitably declined to discuss tactics , but it wo n't have escaped his notice that mexico 's game plan of closing down the midfield , defending to the death and counter-attacking wherever possible seemed to work well enough in hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico has tried to impress on his team the importance of treating brazil not like football gods but like any other team .
" brazil have so many talented players , but so do i , " he explained .
" there 's not a lot of difference between teams today , everyone can beat anyone .
okay brazil are a great team , but they can be beaten - we 've got to go out and win . " zico and his players will hope to do just that .

" the main goal of this conference is to re-engage the international community in stabilizing and building iraq , " he said . while organizers admitted the brussels talks may be short on major new initiatives , they played up the symbolism of a meeting co-hosted by the eu and the united states , whose ties were deeply strained by the 2003 iraq war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is pleased about international consensus " the international consensus that has long eluded us on iraq is now in place , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , as reported by afp . the situation in iraq is critical un secretary general kofi annan was to join ministers , including us secretary of state condoleezza rice , as well as foreign ministers from iraq 's neighbors , notably iran and syria , the g8 , nato and the arab league . the talks come at a delicate time for iraq , where deadly attacks have surged despite the election of an interim government , and where over 130,000 us soldiers remain stationed with no timetable for withdrawal . " the situation in iraq is critical , " an iraqi diplomat told afp .
" we need the help of the international community to support the transitional government . " us president george w. bush hailed the fact that the eu was co-hosting the talks when he met eu leaders in washington monday . " it 's an important signal for people to hear loud and clear that there may have been past differences over iraq , but as we move forward there is a need for the world to work together , " he said at the white house . iraq wants political and financial support on the economic front , iraq wants donor countries to fulfil their commitments , said zebari .
baghdad has complained about delays in delivery on pledges already made , including $ 18 billion -lrb- about 15 billion euros -rrb- from the united states . debt relief has been billed as a key agenda item but there was no indication whether new offers were in the pipeline beyond the $ 32 billion package announced by the paris club of creditor nations in november , which wrote off more than 80 percent of iraq 's debt .
nations outside of the paris club - owed about $ 70 billion , are going to be asked to cancel iraqi debt also . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence is still a daily reality in iraq .
iraqi officials will present their plans for drafting a new constitution and ensuring input and inclusion of all parts of society .
iraq also hopes that the brussels conference will provide support to reform its criminal justice system , which is in serious need of strengthening if it wants to succeed in getting the continuing unrest under control more than two years after former dictator saddam hussein 's ouster . on this front the eu is set to launch an unprecedented initiative next month by training some 800 iraq judges , senior officials and police officers .
the instruction will take place outside of iraq itself . no concrete action likely for the europeans , the conference will mark another step in restoring transatlantic cooperation severely strained by the iraq crisis . an eu diplomat denied that the conference was purely symbolic , but also downplayed prospects of dramatic concrete action - that will be more likely during a donors ' conference scheduled in mid-july in amman . " i do n't think you have to look for new initiatives -lrb- at the brussels conference -rrb- , " she told afp .
" it is more about reaffirming principles . " us ambassador richard jones , the us state department 's coordinator on iraq , said the talks would focus on planning for iraq 's future , as well as demonstrating unity after the strains of the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.06.2005 kids need a big scalp to convince doubters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany are relishing the chance to get one over argentina germany 's young confed cup team are unbeaten in two games , scoring seven goals on the way to the semi-finals and yet , few are convinced of their credentials .
beating argentina on thursday could help change some minds . it 's a shame that both germany and argentina already have their places booked in the semi-finals of the confederations cup before their clash on thursday night in nuremberg . the final group a games would have held a lot more promise if one of the two big teams in the group had to beat the other to progress .
as it is , the top two face each other to see who wins the group and avoids the winner of group b in the last four . commentators have been loath to praise the germany team despite the two victories and seven goals which have put them on top of group a. many have accused them of lacking class and that the successes have not been convincing with a narrow 4-3 win against lowly australia and a late 3-0 defeat of tunisia . on closer inspection , this germany team is operating in a very traditional way and this confederations cup campaign is very similar to that of the 2002 world cup , a campaign which saw germany under-perform on their way to the final only to lose to a free-flowing , confident brazil team at the peak of its powers . parallels with world cup 2002 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , right , scores past south korean goalkeeper lee woon during the 2002 world cup semi-final , june 25 , 2002 .
in japan / korea , germany struggled to overcome the likes of paraguay , the united states and south korea - all 1-0 wins - to make the final .
they thrashed saudi arabia 8-0 in their opening group game but drew 1-1 with the republic of ireland and managed a 2-0 win over cameroon .
there was very little in the way of real competition and germany , on the whole , struggled but still managed to reach the world cup final . but germany won the games that mattered in japan / korea and they are doing the same in the confederations cup where there are fewer games and fewer chances to get it right .
just as in the last world cup , germany have advanced with less than convincing performances but still find themselves in the last four of a major international tournament . big teams the biggest test for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and just as in 2002 , germany 's route to glory may very well be barred by one of the world 's best teams .
argentina will be the germans ' first real test of the tournament and there will be no complacency despite the fact both are through the group stages .
germany will want to beat argentina not just to get top spot and the chance to play the runners-up of group b -lrb- which could be brazil or japan -rrb- but to prove that they can win against the top teams in the world when it matters . argentina will feel empowered by mexico 's defeat of brazil and this will enhance their belief that they can win this trophy .
as the current in-form south american team , argentina will consider themselves favourites for the cup .
but they must first do away with germany .
the 2-2 draw in a friendly this year showed that the germans can raise their game but whether they can raise it enough to beat the argentineans remains to be seen . the match on thursday evening may be the dress rehearsal for the final if germany and argentina can overcome mexico , brazil or japan in the semi-finals .
a win for either side will give a psychological advantage to the victors . australia , tunisia playing for national pride bildunterschrift : in the other group a game , australia and tunisia will play it out for the pride factor of finishing third in the group after two defeats .
neither will want to return home after thursday night without any points on the board .
neither team can feel ashamed with their performances ; australia have taken both germany and argentina to the wire while tunisia have showed a flowing style of soccer that offers great potential for the future . however , it is a consolation game and the result will mean nothing in the context of the whole tournament .

" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .
we 'll be the more relaxed team , that 's good .
we 'll make a few chances and we have to score - we know if we do n't we 'll be on the plane home . " brazilian legend plots downfall of home nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico for zico the stakes do n't come much higher for while this competition is no world cup wednesday 's game pits him against his country of birth for the first time since taking over from philippe troussier as japan coach . " it 's an extremely special game for me .
when i hear the national anthem i 'll be very emotional but the minute it 's over i 'll be working for japan , " said the former brazil star . zico reported no injury concerns as he gave the players who did n't figure in sunday 's 1-0 win over greece a training session held in the searing afternoon heat at the viktoria football ground on the outskirts of cologne .
the stadium had seen better days with the japan squad looking a whole lot healthier than the decaying terraces which were overrun with weeds after losing their fight against nature . despite having an interpreter like his shadow by his side zico more often than not prefers to communicate his wishes visually rather than verbally , and his skills are paying off with japan the first team to qualify for the world cup . pressure normal for brazil , warns zico bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assessing wednesday 's assignment the 52-year-old echoed kawaguchi 's thoughts saying : " brazil have all the pressure .
that may be good for japan , but then again the brazil players are used to coping with pressure . " reflecting on his work as japan coach he added : " what i 'm trying to do here is make the team more balanced , more powerful and organized . " mexico win shatters illusion of invincibility he inevitably declined to discuss tactics , but it wo n't have escaped his notice that mexico 's game plan of closing down the midfield , defending to the death and counter-attacking wherever possible seemed to work well enough in hanover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico has tried to impress on his team the importance of treating brazil not like football gods but like any other team .
" brazil have so many talented players , but so do i , " he explained .
" there 's not a lot of difference between teams today , everyone can beat anyone .
okay brazil are a great team , but they can be beaten - we 've got to go out and win . " zico and his players will hope to do just that .

" miami was the best game of my career , i do n't know whether i 'll be able to keep another clean sheet on wednesday , i hope so , " he said on monday .
japan have to beat brazil to make it into the semi-finals while brazil need only a draw to join mexico in the last four . wednesday 's fixture took on an altogether different hue after brazil suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat against mexico to leave them level on points with zico 's japan .
kawaguchi said : " the pressure 's on brazil , we have no pressure .

private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .
" it ’ s a tendency that has remained more or less stable over the past years . " tsunami the trigger stable it may be , but aid experts are clear that the tsunami last year threw the continuity of private aid off track .

" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history . " when you have difficulties coming to terms with your past and your roots are associated with trauma and pain then you automatically look for things to do that make sense , " said kuhl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.06.2005 giving even when it hurts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : collection boxes in germany were full in the aftermath of the tsunami germans may be hard hit by their struggling economy , but they do n't cut corners when it comes to charitable giving .
they donated in record numbers after the asian tsunami six months ago . when television images of the devastating tsunami in southeast asia entered living rooms on dec .
26 2004 , elke s. ' -lrb- who wished to remain anonymous -rrb- first thought was : ' how can i help ? ' the 61-year-old from worms in southern germany got together with fellow members of the national union of german housewives ' associations , a nationwide organization involved in charitable causes , collected 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,180 -rrb- and handed it to an aid group heading to sri lanka . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german red cross volunteers stock up on aid supplies for tsunami victims elke s. remembers the entire town being mobilized as charity shows and collection boxes turned up at every street corner .
" the willingness to do something to help was enormous , " she recollected . elke s. ' response was repeated throughout the country .
thousands of ordinary germans showed themselves ready to reach for their wallets in response to the aid appeals .
private donations for the tsunami reached 516 million euros by february 2005 , surpassing the previous record of 350 million euros during the floods in eastern germany in 2002 . at home though , many germans are having hard times making ends meet .
a floundering economy , high unemployment , cuts in social benefits and added political uncertainty as the prospect of early federal elections looms has left many germans feeling the pinch .
surveys show that many germans are responding by saving on shopping , vacations and eating out . a steady giving over the years one area that seems immune to the german tendency to scrimp in hard times is charitable giving .
though experts admit that entirely reliable statistics are hard to come by , there are indications that germans ' financial prudence does n't extend to being miserly when it comes to a good cause . two of germany ’ s largest aid groups have just registered record turnovers .
one of them , german agro action , brought in 33.4 million euros in private donations in 2004 - the largest sum ever collected in that form in its 43-year history . hans-joachim preuss , secretary general of the group , said earlier this month at a press conference that the record figure would have been achieved even without the altruistic avalanche in germany sparked by the tsunami .
he said that germans donated 2.6 million euros to the organization after the floods in southeast asia - amounting to less than 8 percent of the total private donations for the year . the trend to continue giving even during tough economic times is confirmed by burkhard wilke , an expert on charitable donations and head of the german central institute for social questions -lrb- dzi -rrb- in berlin . " a willingness to donate for charitable causes irrespective of the economic situation is typical for germans , " said wilke .
" it ’ s a tendency that has remained more or less stable over the past years . " tsunami the trigger stable it may be , but aid experts are clear that the tsunami last year threw the continuity of private aid off track .
though final figures are n't out yet , the dzi forecasts that private donations for 2004 will easily surpass the normal yearly 2.3 - 2.4 billion euro benchmark for private charitable contributions . bildunterschrift : a thai fisherman walks through the tsunami destroyed village of ban nam khem , thailand . fundraisers are cautiously optimistic that the tsunami , which attracted several first-time donors , might lead to an increase in the private donor base in germany , which currently stands at about 40 percent of the 82-million-strong population . wilhelm heerman , an independent fundraiser who helped survey around 5,200 persons aged 18 to 70 across germany earlier this year on their charitable habits , said that almost 12 percent said they had donated during the tsunami for the first time .
" the tsunami was the gateway for many , their first contact with altruistic giving , " said heermann . a new study by the social science research center berlin on donations in germany concludes that though economic factors do play a role in who donates - with housewives and pensioners proving the most generous - and that higher income groups are willing to dig deeper in their pockets , people from poorer backgrounds also engage in charitable causes in a significant way . strong images of the tsunami cynics may point out that the some 500,000 registered aid groups and 12,000 foundations in germany , most of which are registered as non-profitable , offer tax breaks for donations and thus spur people to give . but experts say that in the case of the tsunami , a combination of factors was responsible for the overwhelming charitable response . " it was a real big catastrophe involving large numbers of victims and it occurred at a time when most germans were at home with family during the christmas holidays and in a mellow and reflective mood , " said wilke , adding that the presence of several hundred german and other european travelers among the victims as well as a routine lull in news around christmas contributed to the outpouring of empathy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional fishing boat in indonesian banda aceh which was badly hit by the tsunami but , most agree that it was the constant bombardment of images from the affected countries on television that swayed most people .
heerman said that around 30 percent of the people he had surveyed said they had responded to aid appeals during celebrity-crowned benefit galas on tv or on the radio and internet after seeing the graphic coverage .
" it was a catastrophe that was made visible via strong images and very obviously appealed to the emotions , " heerman said . need for sense and values others , however , think there are deeper reasons for germans ' tendency to give for charity that have to do specifically with the country and the collective pessimism that has gripped it in recent years . julius kuhl , professor of psychology at the university of osnabrück said that though altruism is a universal phenomenon , in the case of the germans it provides an outlet for an ever-increasing need for meaning , connection and values in a globalized world , especially as the country loses its reputation as an economic powerhouse and familiar structures such as a generous social welfare system begin to weaken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an old woman gets something to eat at a soup kitchen in hanover " the opportunity to help also allows access to shared empathy and links to a global aid community that is in effect a value-based community , " said kuhl , adding that the reason for germans ' steadier contribution to charitable causes as compared to other countries could also be found in the country 's scarred history . " when you have difficulties coming to terms with your past and your roots are associated with trauma and pain then you automatically look for things to do that make sense , " said kuhl . " helping others in need often makes you feel stronger and more positive about yourself .

the moves were part of a crackdown on foreign militants , made possible by newly tightened immigration laws . an egyptian and an afghan have been expelled from germany for suspected terrorist links and dozens of other deportations are pending , authorities in the southern state of bavaria said monday .
both men were sent to their respective home countries last week , the state interior ministry said in a statement .
it added that 15 other deportation notices had been served and a further 22 were being prepared .
' extremely dangerous ' it gave no details on the afghan case , because investigations were continuing .
the egyptian , omar yousif , was expelled for threatening german security and supporting a terrorist organizion , the ministry said .
the ministry said he had trained in pakistan at a camp of lashkar-e-taiba , an islamist group fighting against india in the disputed region of kashmir .
security authorities described yousif , who had been in detention since december , as " extremely dangerous and prepared to do violence . "
new laws make deportation easier german security services have tightened surveillance on islamist radicals since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
three of the suicide pilots in those attacks lived in hamburg .
as a result of a new immigration law that took effect jan .
1 , it is now easier to deport suspected foreign militants .
bavaria has been among the most aggressive states in applying the new law , with 12 alleged " extremists and hate preachers " removed since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister the two latest cases " show bavaria is continuing to take a tough line on islamist extremists and swiftly end their residence in germany , " said conservative state interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- .
if the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- win national elections expected in september - as they are widely expected to do - beckstein will likely be a candidate to run the federal interior ministry .
anti-immigration campaign platform in a statement that set off a wave of controversy , beckstein told the welt am sonntag newspaper that the cdu / csu would conduct its campaign in the coming elections on an anti-immigration platform .
voters have the choice between a policy of " massive immigration " if they vote for the social democrat-green party coalition , or one " without immigration , but with extensive family policies , life long work , and permanent further education . "
populist rhetoric ?
the comment unleashed loud resistance and accusations of using dangerously populist tactics , even from the cdu / csu allied free democrats .
the fdp spokesman for interior issues , max stadler , said the plan to base an election on immigration issues took a " populist approach " " nobody would be in favor of massive immigration to germany , " he told the dpa news agency , " that is an accusation that has nothing to do with reality and only serves to get your own followers riled up for the campaign . "
fdp steering committee member sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger told handelsblatt on monday that the comments were " the most sickening kind of campaign rhetoric . "
and the head of the german institute for economic development -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , told the paper that such parries " corrupt the social climate .

but judging by a new study , the country 's teenagers - encouraged by indulgent parents - seem to be throwing all financial caution to the winds . the study by the munich-based market research institute iconkids & youth found that youngsters between the ages of 6 and 19 tend to spend the most - 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- yearly - on clothes and accessories followed by 2.3 billion euros on going out . mobile phones topped the list of accessories with children and teenagers shelling out some 2.5 billion euros on their mobile phones each year with 190 million euros alone spent on downloading games and ring tones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual popkomm music fair in germany draws youngsters every year music apparently is another popular buy with 1.1 billion euros spent yearly on cassettes and cds followed by 1 billion euros on cosmetics and body care products and 960 million euros on computers , software and video games . less kids , more investment the study which polled 1,439 children and teenagers in germany found that despite tough economic times the surveyed age group had increasing amounts of money to burn .

the study found that the latter alone amounts to some 2.4 billion euros yearly . the study concludes that with total spending at 19.8 billion euros currently , young people 's expenses will overtake their incomes this year and thus expects kids to fall back slightly on savings it estimates at a total of 6.3 billion euros .

but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again . it was a scandal that had berliners hopping mad and wondering just what or who had taken over their city .
the sausage stand at the brandenburg gate selling berliners ' beloved currywurst , pork sausage doused in curry-spiced ketchup , was given the run around starting two years ago , and finally forced to close at the end of 2004 .
there were several reasons for this , each more outrageous to berliners than the other . first , the humble stand was deemed not classy enough for the newly renovated pariser platz behind the brandenburg gate with its high-end hotels , boutiques and embassies .
then surrounding restaurants began complaining of price dumping , since they charged more for their own fat-filled delicacies .
finally , surrounding residents -lrb- transplants from other parts of germany , surely ! -rrb- began to complain that the smell from the roasting meat was " aggravating . " the stand , despite the outcry from locals , was cast out into the wilderness and politicians from the nearby reichstag and tourists visiting some of berlin 's primary landmarks had to make do with panini from starbucks , which apparently had the appropriate profile for the " new " berlin . but in the end , the little guy won , and the snack bar is back . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elke zieschang , proud sausage stand owner thanks to the intervention of some high-profile politicians and artists , who evidently have n't forgotten their roots , currywurst and french fries are again to be had near the gate .
the owner of the new snack bar , elke zieschang -lrb- photo -rrb- , beat out 30 other applicants for the coveted spot . zieschang got the commission because her product comes from pigs not raised on factory farms , and the organic meat is free from antibiotics and dyes .
" for the government , it 's politically correct sausage , " she said .
every week , she offers a sausage specialty from a different part of germany .
all that impressed the powers that decide such matters . on tuesday , the first day of the sausage stand 's triumphant return , business was been booming .
and it better stay that way , if zieschang wants to recoup the 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,000 -rrb- she 's invested in the operation .
she needs to sell around 500 sausages a day .
considering the expansive nature of waistlines in berlin , that likely wo n't be a problem . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germans do n't do low-carb while the latest diet craze makes its way through the us , germans continue chomping down on bread and potatoes .

how many breakfast viewers would set their alarms well before 5am , just to take a photo ?
well , the answer , it seems , is hundreds of you .
just before 4.30am this morning , we began receiving your digital photos .
the wave of e-mails began with those living in the scottish highlands and islands - and swept southwards , rather like the sunrise itself .
we 'd asked what dawn looks like on the longest day wherever you live .
and you responded magnificently .
by 6am , we 'd had at least 100 e-mails .
by 8am , we 'd lost count of the number of photographs you 'd sent in .
some of you sent photographs of the view from your front garden .
some of you went further and trekked to local beauty spots : parks , lakes - even a windfarm high up in the pennines .
we showed a selection on bbc breakfast this morning - and you can see more here on the website .
the summer solstice we 've had so many high quality images that bbc news 24 will also be using them throughout the day .
the image that we 're using at the top of this page was sent to us by ian carus , from the black isle in the north of scotland .
he tells us : " this was taken at 4.15 this morning from our front garden .
" i was really lucky with the light , as shortly after it clouded over and started to rain . "
sonia sellick sent us the view from her front garden , at malmesbury in wiltshire .
and karl risley confesses that he sneaked off from a nightshift at raf portreath , to send us his photo of newquay , taken somewhere between portreath and hell 's mouth .
ben monkhouse from guernsey sent us a golden sunrise , from st peter port .
and keen photographer john wigley , from petersfield in hampshire , went to his local beauty spot : the heath lake .
we have been amazed at how many wonderful pictures have been e-mailed to us this morning , but unfortunately , we 're unable to handle any more .
if you did n't manage to get your image to us in time , do n't worry : we 're hoping to repeat the whole exercise very soon .

its director general , roger bennett , outlines the challenges facing game makers . "
the summit comes at a particularly interesting time , as convergence with other forms of electronic media is providing huge opportunities for games .
convergence does not just mean different electronic access opportunities for consumers but also the development of innovative ideas and content , through cooperation and joint ventures with traditional media such as film and tv .
with the new consoles due later this year and next year , we are looking at how the ways in which games will be played , the ways the consumer can access games and the opportunities for new types of games .
but games are increasingly becoming expensive to develop and market .
risk aversion rules the day because of the cost involved in making games .
uk game developers have to adjust to a new era of commercial realities .
publishers have to look at maximising their intellectual property they own and exploiting it to the fullest .
it is a difficult time for some , but the consumer is benefiting from the huge leap in technology and in the style of games .
there are innovative new products that are seeing the light of day .
they are less numerous than they were , and that is always a concern .
expanding gaming with the advent of new platforms , there is an argument that that is when the innovation kicks in .
that is the excitement for the future .
so it is not just about new games , but about new types of games .
new genres are the holy grail for the new platforms .
but the risks of creating something completely new from nothing has to be reduced , otherwise it will be a constant regurgitation of sequel or branded products .
the industry has been remarkably successful in creating a market place for compelling immersive content .
the challenge now is to create new markets , creating new genres and new content that appeal to a wide audience .
in particular the gender gap needs to be filled .
it needs more female involvement in the development process .
if the games industry is to be successful , it has to be creative in providing innovative content that can be transferred to other media . "

many trusts do not start timing responses until minutes after receiving a call , it has emerged .
latest figures show that most ambulance trusts in england claim to have hit a government target on response time .
but they do not show that trusts count response time from different starting points , the bbc 's andrew hosken said .
in 2001 , the government said ambulances should reach at least 75 % of life-threatening emergency calls in eight minutes - the maximum time a cardiac arrest patient has to be seen if they are to have any chance of surviving .
according to the latest figures , 26 out of the 31 ambulance trusts in england claim to have hit the target or bettered it .
wide discrepancies but it has emerged that many trusts do not start the clock until a minute-and-a-half to two minutes after receiving a call , the bbc investigation found .
there are also wide discrepancies among ambulance trusts as to what they term as a life-threatening emergency .
roger thame , chief executive of the staffordshire ambulance service , the country 's best-performing ambulance trust , said the late clock sometimes enabled ambulance services to achieve targets and could be masking poor performance .

its director general , roger bennett , outlines the challenges facing game makers .
bennett : rising costs are an issue for small developers the summit comes at a particularly interesting time , as convergence with other forms of electronic media is providing huge opportunities for games .
convergence does not just mean different electronic access opportunities for consumers but also the development of innovative ideas and content , through cooperation and joint ventures with traditional media such as film and tv .
with the new consoles due later this year and next year , we are looking at how the ways in which games will be played , the ways the consumer can access games and the opportunities for new types of games .
but games are increasingly becoming expensive to develop and market .
risk aversion rules the day because of the cost involved in making games .
uk game developers have to adjust to a new era of commercial realities .
publishers have to look at maximising their intellectual property they own and exploiting it to the fullest .
it is a difficult time for some , but the consumer is benefiting from the huge leap in technology and in the style of games .
there are innovative new products that are seeing the light of day .
they are less numerous than they were , and that is always a concern .
expanding gaming with the advent of new platforms , there is an argument that that is when the innovation kicks in .
that is the excitement for the future .
games need to extend their appeal beyond just men so it is not just about new games , but about new types of games .
new genres are the holy grail for the new platforms .
but the risks of creating something completely new from nothing has to be reduced , otherwise it will be a constant regurgitation of sequel or branded products .

her methods are tough but effective - she has all the students who have not paid their fees locked out of the school .
this applies to three-quarters of students and the school is in a dire financial position .
the teachers have gone without full pay for three months , the staff are on the brink of revolt and teacher truancy is rife .
eddie 's story fourteen-year-old eddie is one of the children stopped at the gate .
the moment you are educated it means a good job - it means everything .
mrs mukasa eddie is 10th in his class and dreams of getting far enough in school to become an accountant .
eddie is an orphan and since his parents died he has had difficulty raising the 67,000 shillings he needs to pay his fees each term .
that 's only about £ 20 -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- , but for the average ugandan it is six weeks wages .
he works in a bar at weekends , helps his brother charge car batteries for 1,000 shillings -lrb- £ 0.30 or $ 0.50 -rrb- a time , and is waylaid by malaria as he struggles to pay the school .
" i like this school , " eddie enthuses .
" they have good teachers , pupils who are bright and i have good friends here .
-lsb- but -rsb- i am an orphan who lost my father , mother and also my brother so now it is very difficult to get the fees " .
economic struggle eddie is not alone in finding school fees a struggle .
uganda 's economy has suffered from almost two decades of civil war .
many refugees from the fighting in the north have fled to masindi district .
and while the proportion of people with aids has fallen nationally , local hiv rates in masindi are 13 % and there are many orphans .
eddie 's classmate is a lively boy called justus .
he refuses to be turned away .
" today i will not stay without learning , " justus insists .
" what i will do is just enter through the fence .
in this world of today if you do n't have plans you can not survive . "
he manages to sneak through a hole in the fence and tricks his teacher with a borrowed payment card to get into class .
at masindi secondary school the children 's naughtiness is often motivated by their enthusiasm for education .
mrs mukasa explains : " in uganda education means a lot .
the moment you are educated it means a good job , it means good money , it means everything .
that 's why you find that these poor peasants are trying their best to educate their students - they have to go to school . "
teachers mrs mukasa 's clamp down on " fees defaulters " is inspired by her commitment to the school and its staff .
even at state schools like masindi , the students often pay fees .
the teachers receive their basic salary from the ugandan government , but that money alone is not enough to provide a decent standard of living .
paying the staff a decent wage is an almost impossible task a grade 5 secondary school teacher nets 280,000 shillings per month - only £ 90 or $ 165 .
many state schools , including masindi , collect fees from their pupils in order to increase the teachers ' wages .
" it 's the biggest administrative challenge we face , " says mrs mukasa .
" we 've convinced parents to allocate some little money so we can give the teachers a bonus . "
but when these " bonus " payments are late , some staff play truant .
" we are forced to find a way to subsidise our earnings , " explains one teacher .
" we end up sometimes even tending our tomato fields during the time we should have been here , so it is important that the fees are paid if we are to concentrate on this work here . "
uganda has been striving to improve its education system .
and there have been significant successes .
universal primary education was introduced in 1997 , making all government primary schools free and leading to a doubling and more of pupil numbers .
that means there are now many more children completing primary education and ready to enter secondary school .
and so for many more ugandan parents and children , there is the potentially heart-breaking decision about whether they can afford to continue paying the fees .
masindi secondary school features in a bbc four series made by lion productions on tuesdays and thursdays at 2030 bst beginning on tuesday 21 june 2005 .
